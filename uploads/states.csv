Space X wants to close it for at least two months a year and maybe more. (via National Park Service)This is such a breakable age. Things we thought would last are, to our surprise, now in danger of shattering.
You think our state parks will always be preserved? Nope, we’re going to try to put golf courses in them. Think the Everglades will be protected forever? Sorry, we’re building a prison camp there. Think our system for buying environmental land will be free of political influence? Too bad, here’s a shady campaign contributor getting $83 million for four acres in Destin.
Last week I heard about another target for breakage, one that I thought would never see a crack: The natural lands serving as a buffer around Cape Canaveral.
Space X, the aerospace company owned by Elon Musk, wants to make big changes at the Cape. It wants to boost the number of rockets it launches and lands there, as well as boosting the size of the rocket involved.
“SpaceX is seeking [federal] approval for up to 44 Starship-Super Heavy launches per year from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center,” Florida Today reported last month. The proposal has drawn opposition from residents and officials from Titusville, Cape Canaveral, and Brevard County, as well as environmental groups worried about the potential harm to nesting sea turtles, manatees, and endangered right whales.
They’re also concerned about increased pollution, rampant water waste, a huge loss of public access, lots more sonic booms and — not to be rude — the tendency of Space X rockets to blow up. There have been four explosions so far this year.

“Yes, we have seen those headlines,” said Katie Bauman of the Surfrider Foundation, one of the most vocal environmental groups challenging the expansion.
Space X called one of those explosions “a sudden energetic event.” That’s not the kind of energy folks on the Space Coast want to see in their backyard.
But it does give a fresh context to this comment about Space X’s impact on the region by Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Haridopolos: “We are booming, literally, right now.”
The water goes pfft!
“Starship-Super Heavy” sounds like the latest iteration of the “We Built This City” rock group that started as Jefferson Airplane, morphed into Jefferson Starship then became plain Starship.
Instead, it’s actually “the world’s most powerful launch vehicle ever developed,” according to the Space X website. It’s designed to take cargo or astronauts into Earth orbit, to the Moon or even Mars, yet be as reusable as Tupperware.
“Starship and Super Heavy are designed to return to the launch site and be caught following their flight, with the ability to rapidly turn around and launch again,” the company says.
For now, its launch operations have been confined to Texas. Although Musk has had successes, repeated explosions — like the one in March that Reuters reported left “fiery debris streaking through the dusk skies near South Florida” — are something Musk dismissed as “a minor setback.”
During an Aug. 22 Space Coast Symposium speech, SpaceX Vice President of Launch Kiko Dontchev told the crowd, “You’re going to get a vetted machine that shows up ready to party.”
Clearly his definition of “party” is different from mine, and from that of a lot of the people who live and work near the Kennedy Space Center.
“Constituents and businesses have expressed concern over the cumulative environmental effects of high frequency launches, including emissions, chemical runoff, and disturbances to protected coastal and marine habitats,” Brevard County Commissioner Katie Delaney wrote in a letter to federal officials.
The Federal Aviation Administration must decide whether to permit this, which requires an environmental impact statement. In a first draft, FAA officials determined the Starship liftoffs — punctuated by up to 152 sonic booms per year — would generate “few” significant environmental impacts at Launch Complex 37.
That’s not how Bill Fisk sees it.
Bill Fisk via Linkedin
Fisk, a Florida native who grew up watching the Apollo launches with his dad and grandfather, is both the president of the Space Coast Audubon Society and vice chair of the Turtle Coast Sierra Club. For my edification, he catalogued the biggest impacts.
Start with the water, which Bauman of Surfrider brought up as well.
Space X expects to use 400,000 gallons of water per launch and 68,000 gallons per landing, all to cool down hot equipment. That plus other uses for the site put the expected total water use for Space X at 50 million gallons per year.
Yet Brevard is already running low on potable water for residents and businesses, Fisk said.
“It’s getting worse as the developers get more leeway, so the water supply keeps going PFFFT!” he said.
After its use, the remaining Space X fresh water would flow into local waterways that are supposed to be brackish, messing up their salt content. That includes the struggling Indian River Lagoon, where there’s a need to bring back sea grass beds as a nursery for fish and a food source for manatees.
“There is a clear and direct negative impact to the physical environment of the area … by adding excessive amounts of fresh water into the pristine local estuary,” the Southeastern Fisheries Association said in a comment letter to the FAA.
Local fishermen are already complaining about falling space debris damaging their equipment, Fisk said. Crumbling local roads can’t handle the increase in fuel truck traffic, he said. Titusville is bringing in an engineer to examine its public buildings to see if they can handle the increased vibrations.
After all, Fisk said, when the early space program was being built, “everything was built fast and it was built cheap.”
The race to space
The waters off Cape Canaveral saw the last sea battle of the Revolutionary War (we won). That marked the last big news there for a couple of centuries.
But then a Mexican cemetery blew up.
In the 1940s, the American military tested missiles by firing them from New Mexico, but one went off course and blew up a Juarez graveyard. Mexican officials complained, so the military looked for a safer launch site.
They found it at in Florida at what was then known as the Banana River Naval Air Station. The place was isolated, the land already belonged to the government, and the location near the equator meant rockets got an extra boost when they took off.  Everyone seemed happy.
Then, in 1957, Sputnik changed everything.
Suddenly, America was running second to the Soviets and the Space Race was on. Cape Canaveral became the focus of a U.S. space program playing catch-up.
Brevard’s population boomed as engineers, scientists, and construction crews poured into the once-sleepy towns.
“The beach mushroomed and became sheathed in schlock,” author Herb Hiller wrote. ”Everything was built quick and short-term. Motels in Cocoa Beach and Titusville flashed neon rockets and dancing girls. Inside, sequined cuties danced and did more. Motel Row became Sin Strip.”
In the runup to the moon landing, the work force at Canaveral peaked at 26,500 in 1968. But then Space Coast residents found out what any coal miner could’ve told them: It’s no fun living in a company town when the company winds down.
A year after the historic Apollo 11 mission, the work force fell to 15,000. Rocket scientists were pumping gas. Families who couldn’t find a buyer left their keys in the front door of their houses as they left town.
Yet, during the boom and bust, one thing remained constant: the natural buffers around the cape, which preserved the Old Florida feel of a place jumping into the 21st century.
In 1963, the feds created the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, 140,000 acres with more endangered and threatened species than any other refuge in the continental U.S.
Then, a decade later, they set up Canaveral National Seashore — 58,000 acres of barrier island, open lagoon, coastal hammock, pine flatwoods, and offshore waters.
But Space X says every time there’s a takeoff or landing, both must shut down for safety. Even the nude beach.
The naked and the clothed
Florida is the state with the most nudist resorts — 29, compared to 14 for second-place California. Harder to find are Florida’s nude beaches. They exist, but most are not official.
One well-known example is in Canaveral National Seashore: the southern end of Playalinda Beach, accessed from Parking Lot 13.
“Not too many places can you get a full view of a rocket launch while giving a full view,” WKMG-TV noted in a story that reported Playalinda had been named the 20th best nude beach in the world.
One person who submitted a comment against the Space X plan identified himself as a member of the American Association for Nude Recreation. He told the feds, “I do not see the need for corporations to take away our public privileges to public and federal lands.”
Plenty of people who ARE wearing clothes use the rest of Playalinda for swimming, surfing, fishing, picnicking, and camping. After all, it’s the longest stretch of undeveloped Atlantic coastline in Florida.
Both the naked and the clothed are freaking out about the part of the Space X plan that calls for closing access to the beach for at least 60 days a year  — maybe more.
Space program veterans call Musk “the Nibbler,” Fisk told me, because “he’ll say he wants 50 launches — no wait, make it 120 — oh no, we need to do 160 launches.” He keeps nibbling a little more each time.
Residents who love Playalinda don’t want to play Musk’s shutdown game. It’s a public beach that the public wants to use, not hand over to the world’s richest man whenever he wants.
“What we want is a fair middle ground — where launch activity can thrive without compromising the health, safety, and quality of life for our residents,” Commissioner Delaney said on her substack.
I haven’t even mentioned the other Space X threat, one that would affect more than just one region of Florida.
The company wants to launch its Starship-Super Heavy rocket from its existing base in Texas to attain a low-Earth orbit. It would soar over most of North and Central Florida in a way that would block at least 10 and as many as 200 commercial airline flights.
The big break
I was curious about what an actual scientist had to say about all this.
Ken Kremer via X
I got in touch with Ken Kremer, a Ph.D. with 17 patents who’s been writing about the space industry for two decades. He runs the website Space Upclose and boasts that he’s witnessed more than 100 launches.
He agreed with everyone else I talked to about how awful it would be for Space X to close off Playalinda Beach for 60 days minimum.
“That’s really terrible to cut that off for two months,” he said.
But he saw a reasonable alternative.
Apollo 11 rocket launch via Florida State Archives
Space X wants to use Launch Complex 39A. That’s where a lot of American space history happened, including the launch of Apollo 11. An explosion there would wipe out all the historic structures.
Ten miles away is Launch Complex 37. Space X wants to use that one too. Why not require the company to use it exclusively? That way, he said, only minimal beach closures would be required.
“There have to be some reasonable compromises,” Kremer said.
Of course, just changing the launch site doesn’t solve the other problems with pollution, excess water usage, and so forth.
Space Coast residents used to be willing to give the space program the benefit of the doubt because they felt they were doing their patriotic duty. But it’s not like that anymore. Space X is not NASA. It’s just a for-profit business, putting more money into Musk’s already bulging pockets.
I think we should tell Space X that the only way it will be allowed to do everything it wants with Cape Canaveral is if every single launch or landing in Florida carries as a passenger someone named Musk.
It could be Elon. It could be his awful father. It could be one of his 14 kids.
Then, all the water that’s left afterward, they have to drink it. And if they complain about it, tell them, “Hey, those are the breaks.”

The first of its kind report, “State Scorecard on Medicare Performance: How Medicare Is Working for Its Beneficiaries” from the Commonwealth Fund, places Kentucky as the third worst state for Medicare performance. Medicare is mostly for people who are at least 65, though some illnesses and disabilities qualify people for coverage before that age. 
Researchers based their rankings on access to care, quality of care, costs and affordability of care and population health in 2023 and 2024. Mississippi and Louisiana were the only states ranked lower than Kentucky on these measures. The best-performing states were Vermont, Utah and Minnesota.

Dr. Joseph Betancourt, the Commonwealth Fund president, said during a Wednesday press call that “Medicare, while a vital safety net for millions of Americans, is not working the same for everyone.” 
“Despite being a national program, the scorecard reveals that where you live often shapes your experience,” Betancourt said. “As a primary care physician, I know how important it is when patients can focus on healing instead of worrying about medical bills. Medicare makes that possible for millions, but we have more work to do to ensure it delivers the care equally and effectively for people in every state.” 
Medicare beneficiaries in southeastern states — including Kentucky — were much more likely than the national average to get prescriptions considered generally “unsafe” for elderly patients, according to David Radley, a senior scientist with the Commonwealth Fund. 
“These are medications that evidence tells us that should be avoided in the elderly when we compare to beneficiaries in other parts of the country,” he said. 
“We also found that the rate of hospitalization from preventable causes, a measure that generally reflects inadequate disease management, is more than double the lowest ranked states compared to the top performing states,” Radley said. The national rate of preventable hospital admissions was 26.4 per 1,000 people in 2023, according to the report. In Kentucky, that was 31.5. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s report found that the rate of preventable hospitalizations is higher in southeastern states, including Kentucky. (Screenshot)
Other takeaways include:

More Kentucky Medicare beneficiaries (66%) than the national average (62%) had three or more chronic conditions in 2023. 
In 2024, nearly 5% of adults in Kentucky older than 65 reported going without needed medical care because of cost. The national average is just under 4%.
More Kentucky adults 65 and older (36%) report feeling lonely than the national average (34%). 
In 2023, the rate per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries to have a preventable hospitalization was 31.5 in Kentucky and 26.4 nationwide. 

Kristen Kolb, a registered nurse and research associate at the Commonwealth Fund, said those last two points are connected. 
“Research has shown that loneliness is a risk factor for hospital readmissions and is associated with increased health care costs,” she said. “Loneliness or lack of emotional support, is a widespread issue affecting at least 1 in 4 older adults in every state where data was available. Loneliness can have negative health effects and has been linked with poorer health outcomes like increased risk of heart disease and stroke.” 
Betancourt said meaningful social connections and their link to “strong cognitive function” are “critical,” especially for older adults. In 2024 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that loneliness can increase risk of heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, dementia and earlier death. 
More Kentucky adults 65 and older (36%) report feeling lonely than the national average (34%). (Screenshot)
Gretchen Jacobson, the vice president of Medicare, Expanding Coverage and Access at the Commonwealth Fund, said policies at the federal and state levels can help address disparities by setting standards for private plans and incentivizing “providers to apply best practices and reduce wasteful spending and care.” 
“Although Medicare is a national program, health outcomes, access to needed health care, the affordability of care and quality of care all vary widely for the people it covers, and some issues such as loneliness, affect many older adults no matter where they live,” she said. “The combination of state and federal health policy is what enables beneficiaries to get the health care they need, and ultimately affects their health outcomes and experiences with care.”

A shopping plaza being modified to include townhomes or watching your children move away because a home in town is unaffordable?,"With the arrival of Autumn here in Connecticut, many embrace the spooky, Halloween-y spirit. There’s no better place in New England to dance with the macabre than in Salem, Massachusetts, sight of colonial America’s most infamous episode of mass hysteria. 
In 1692 dozens of Salemites were executed for the crime of witchcraft. When one visits the somber memorials and kitschy shops today, it’s easy to indulge in morbid daydreaming. What if witches, the Devil, and all his diabolical servants are real, after all? It can be thrilling to give oneself a good scare.
While it is unclear if supernatural forces remain at work in Salem, the city faces the same mundane challenges of home affordability as anywhere else. Recently, Salem eliminated municipal parking minimums for multifamily housing structures. Instead of requiring builders to set aside a specific number of off-street parking spots for all new construction, the city allows developers to determine the appropriate quantity to provide. Satanic black magic? Nope, just good policy.
Studies have shown time and time again that when cities and towns mandate arbitrary parking minimums for residential and commercial construction, they drive up rents and home-prices, while simultaneously enforcing automobile dependence on residents.
If asked, most Nutmeggers would say that they want to live in a walkable community and that homes are too expensive these days. If you ask them, however, if they support policies that lower housing costs and increase pedestrian accessibility, many recoil in fear.
What’s so scary about housing reform? Many Connecticut residents are terrified of the same kind of common-sense adjustments that Salem’s City Council passed almost unanimously. Connecticut’s HB 5002, the much maligned housing affordability bill debated this summer, included a provision to loosen local parking minimums. While it passed in both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature, Gov. Ned Lamont was pressured to veto the bill after pushback not just from Republicans, but members of his own party.
Why? Many of HB 5002’s opponents were frightened by the bill’s regulatory shifts. I sympathize with these anxieties, but I think the bill’s opponents are worried about the wrong things.
Let’s consider parking minimums. Many who support mandatory off-street parking minimums insist that developers will not build enough parking unless forced, but evidence indicates that this isn’t true. In addition to driving up housing costs, mandatory parking minimums create a paved-over infrastructure that inhibits walkability.
Automobile emissions are a major driver of climate change. When we reduce mandatory parking minimums, we facilitate walkable development. This in turn lowers our carbon footprint.
Opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: What is scarier? Climate catastrophe or walking to the grocery store?
Let’s talk about home affordability. Opponents of HB 5002 considered the bill’s provision for by-right multifamily construction in commercial areas to be downright demonic. Local residents, they argue, should be empowered to resist careless developers, who would build structures that increase traffic or mutilate local character. This fear of inappropriate development is understandable, but misplaced.
Excessive public input regarding home permitting leads to fewer homes and higher prices. It may seem democratic to require public approval for housing developments, but public meetings are not necessarily representative of the majority of residents. Ask any town official (off the record) and they will tell you that most public commentary is less a rational analysis of the potential outcomes of a given project, and more an opportunity for cranks to take their social media ramblings to a captive audience.
Opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: What is scarier? A shopping plaza being modified to include townhomes without your personal approval, or watching your children move away because a home in town is unaffordable?
Almost all Connecticut Republicans opposed HB 5002. I think this was a poor political strategy, because the party has recently made impressive gains with working-class voters. The GOP should support policies that create an easier path to homeownership for this constituency.
Stranger still was the bill’s Democratic opposition. NIMBYism in blue states has placed the Democratic Party in a precarious electoral position. Liberal strongholds like California, New York and Illinois are hemorrhaging voters to red states, where home construction is able to keep up with demand. If Democrats don’t start building homes in states they control, a presidential candidate in 2032 could win every state that Joe Biden won in 2020, and still lose the electoral college.
Democratic opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: what is scarier? A few new apartments in town or a permanently Republican-occupied White House?
‘Tis the season for a good scare, but when Connecticutians reject reasonable changes in the way we plan our communities, we accelerate global warming, increase the cost of housing, and isolate residents from each other. That is one scare I could do without.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Passengers at Alaska’s biggest airports may soon see a political advertisement published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that blames Democrats for the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
The video, promoted by the White House, features Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and is expected to appear at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints.
Airport officials in other states — including Noem’s home state of South Dakota — have declined to allow the video, citing longstanding policies against airing political content.
In Alaska, the state department of transportation and public facilities owns and operates more than 230 airports statewide, including Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport and Fairbanks International Airport. 
Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson for the department, said TSA has requested permission to air the ad at both of those airports, but not at others the state operates.
She said those airports “don’t own screens that would be used for this type of content” and that the screens in most parts of the airport are “typically the property of an advertising concessionaire.”
“That said,” McCarthy added, “the Transportation Security Administration does have the ability to display the video within its leased areas at the airport.”
TSA did not respond to an inquiry sent to its listed email address. The phone and email of its listed contact for the region that covers Alaska was disconnected.
Alaska’s Executive Branch Ethics Act prohibits the use of “state funds, facilities, equipment … for partisan political purposes,” but transportation officials said they don’t believe the ethics law applies in this case.
In the 30-second video, Noem acknowledged the federal government shutdown may affect travel, saying “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government. … We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
Senate Republicans could unilaterally pass budget language funding the government, but doing so would require them to eliminate the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes instead of 50 for much of the U.S. Senate’s business.
The Senate has already sidestepped the filibuster with regard to presidential appointments to public office, allowing them to appoint officials without Democratic votes.
Senate Democrats have said they also are willing to offer votes for a shutdown-ending budget deal if Senate Republicans agree to extend subsidies for health care coverage. Thus far, Senate Republicans have declined to do so. 
“TSA operates under a license agreement or what TSA calls an ‘Other Transactions Agreement’ or OTA. … It is silent with respect to displaying videos like the one in question,” McCarthy said.
Only a handful of Alaska’s airports aren’t owned and operated by the state. One notable exception is Juneau International Airport, the state’s third-largest.
There, airport manager Andres Delgado said that he had received an email from a TSA official providing advance notice but hadn’t yet received an official request. 
He said he wanted to check with the city manager and legal counsel before deciding whether to allow the video.
“We’ve been, understandably, trying to avoid taking a stance on it,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240218_164207-airport1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 23:01:11.653529

Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), left, and Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, right, speak at a community forum focused on Michigan Arab and Muslim American issues hosted by Emgage Michigan. Oct. 15, 2025 | ScreenshotTwo candidates in the race to claim Michigan’s soon-to-be vacant U.S. Senate seat shared their views on policy and the state’s future in a community forum organized by Emgage, a political advocacy group dedicated to educating and mobilizing Muslim American voters.
Appearing during a virtual webinar on Wednesday evening were Democratic candidates Abdul El-Sayed and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak. The two candidates seeking to carry the torch of the retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters used the opportunity to further engage with the state’s Arab American and Muslim voters, which carry significant political weight in key regions of that state.
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is also seeking the seat and is considered the Democratic establishment’s favorite in the race, did not attend the forum due to a scheduling conflict, her campaign said.
Her absence, however, opened a lane for El-Sayed and McMorrow to shine. Several of the questions dealt with Muslim access to the ballot, what they would do to address the rise of anti-Muslim hate, and musings on free speech in the wake of crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests.
Here are some of El-Sayed’s and McMorrow’s top responses to questions asked by moderators during the forum. The questions asked by Emgage are in bold and the candidates’ responses follow.
 
Michigan universities have silenced student dissent by branding criticism of Israel as antisemitic. Attorney General Dana Nessel criminally charged university students for expressing their freedom of speech while protesting Israel’s atrocities. Do you believe these charges were appropriate?
El-Sayed: The foundation of our democratic republic is that you have the right to peaceful protest, to freedom of expression. And when that right gets taken away, or when somebody uses the power of the state to oppress somebody for having used that right, something deep and profound is lost. We’ve seen a witch hunt lead from a Democratic attorney general’s office against students for practicing their right to freedom of speech, and I have never faltered when it comes to standing with students against this, frankly, overreach of on the part of a very particular elected official. I’m not afraid to call out my party, rather famously not afraid to call out my party. And I’ve been clear about the fact that, for me, we run on principle, and one of those principles is that any attempt to stifle speech anywhere ends up potentially silencing speech everywhere. It’s the same exact set of policies we’re seeing out of the Trump administration.
McMorrow: The fundamental right to free speech and to protest is exactly that: Fundamental. There is no place where that should be safer than college campuses, places where we send our kids to have difficult conversations and, many times, to be around people who may look different or have different backgrounds from them, maybe for the first time in their entire lives. So I will be a fierce defender of protest, of free speech. I believe that we all bear a responsibility to ensure that that is protected. When it crosses the line into crime, I spoke out when there were a couple of protesters that broke that line and went to the home of Jordan Acker, who’s a University of Michigan regent, defaced his wife’s car and threw jars of urine through the window while his family was home and his daughters were sleeping upstairs. That is where we all need to work together to ensure that free speech is protected.
 
What specific policies would you champion to protect the civil liberties of Arab and Muslim Americans in the face of rising Islamophobia?
El-Sayed: I remember watching as our country ripped itself apart in the post 9/11 era. … I watched as we did things that were in complete opposition to our Constitution, to people who look like us because of our names, because of our faith. First and foremost, we have to stand up to the post 9/11 surveillance state, the network that has wantonly put people who have particular names on no fly lists. I also think about infringements on our freedom of speech. You look at things like Project Ester, you look at bans when it comes to freedom of speech to advocate for the Palestinian cause. And I think in the U.S. Senate, the kind of leadership we need is the kind of leadership that’s both going to take on and dismantle the very illegal system of surveillance and oppression that we’ve seen erected since 9/11 but also its second coming in the form of the assault on basic civil liberties and freedom of speech.
McMorrow: When the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed accusing Dearborn of being a jihadist city, I spoke out, and I spoke out loudly. But it’s not enough just to use your platform. It’s what you do in legislation, as well. We passed and strengthened hate crimes legislation in the state of Michigan, something that I would advocate on the federal level. We live in a moment where social media companies are weaponizing and buying our time and attention, our energy, our names, that it’s all available in public. We need somebody who is willing to stand up to social media companies, to tech companies, to protect our privacy, to protect our data. We passed strong data privacy legislation in the state of Michigan.
 
We’ve already experienced the Muslim-Africa travel ban [in Donald Trump’s first presidential term], and we are seeing the U.S. Department of State targeting the community with visa suspensions. What is your stance on accepting refugees from conflict zones … and how would you address immigration processing under the Trump administration?
El-Sayed: Immigration is good. I should be 100% clear about that. One of the neat tricks that America has had is it’s been able to convince people from all over the world to bring their skills, their resources and their energy and enthusiasm here to build. I know that as a fact because my parents immigrated from another country. I shudder to think about what decision they may have made had they been making that decision in 2025 in Trump’s America, versus in 1978, when my dad immigrated here to go to Wayne State. … [It rests on] the notion that we owe a responsibility to continue to be that kind of country that welcomes people is particularly true when we’re talking about people who come from conflict zones, particularly those who come from conflict zones where our military was involved.
McMorrow: What we are watching is a weaponization of ICE and Immigration Services that actually does nothing to make us safer, and it in fact, makes us less safe. The things that law enforcement agencies need to do their job well is trust within the community. [The federal government’s immigration enforcement] is un-American, and it doesn’t benefit us as Michiganders. Michigan is a state that has attracted people from all around the world who have led us to become one of the most diverse states in the entire country, and that enriches all of our opportunities here in Michigan. I will continue to use my platform as a candidate to pull the wool back on what Kristi Noem and the Trump administration are doing, because it’s not security, it’s security theater.
 
Many Arab and Muslim American voters no longer trust the Democratic Party. How can you rebuild trust and earn their votes without simply echoing their frustrations? 
El-Sayed: I watched, in 2024, as our party sided with a genocidal leader in a country committing a genocide with our tax dollars. And I watched so much of that trust and so much of that work dashed. I don’t know when we stopped being the party of peace, but I’ll tell you this, I remember voting for Barack Obama back in 2008. It was my second presidential election, so excited to vote for him, because he was somebody who’s willing to stand up against a stupid war, the one that we should never have fought. And my question today is, why? How can we not, as a party, recognize that those are our roots, guaranteeing people health care, siding with workers over corporations, making sure that we don’t send our money abroad to drop bombs on other people’s kids, when we could be spending it here on our schools and our health care and our own infrastructure? It’s really not that hard. And I think if we want to win back our community, we have to win back our community on principle, and those are the principles I’m running on.
McMorrow: I’ve even been disappointed by my own party. I wonder what our message is and what we stand for, how are we fighting and how are we standing up for people? I am somebody who came into this work because I believe in the power of community and bringing people together. I also, as the chair of the state Senate Economic and Community Development Committee, believe that the way for us to approach foreign policy is not by leading with the military first, it’s by creating economic opportunity, creating business exchanges, welcoming refugees, welcoming immigrants. … That is something that I have built a track record of. I would love to sit around every table with you, to hear your stories. And we have a lot of work to do to build that trust back. And I’m encouraged to see that we are facing a new generation of leadership across the board, coming into Congress and coming into the Senate, who can hopefully write a new Democratic Party.

,California,2025-10-16 01:31:10+00:00,CalMatters,California hospitals are suing over the state’s efforts to curb their spending,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/hospital-spending-cap-lawsuit/,"Hospitals argue that spending caps imposed by an affordability office will result in layoffs, cuts in health care services and reduced access to care for Californians.","In summary
Hospitals argue that spending caps imposed by an affordability office will result in layoffs, cuts in health care services and reduced access to care for Californians.



California hospitals filed a lawsuit against a state health regulator Wednesday, seeking to block rules meant to keep consumer health care costs from growing too quickly. 
The state Office of Health Care Affordability sets limits on health care spending, capping the amount that a hospital’s spending can grow each year. The California Hospital Association argues that the rules are illegal and will result in layoffs and cuts in services, ultimately reducing access to care.
In a complaint filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, the hospital association argues that setting spending limits creates “arbitrary and irresponsible cost targets that single out hospitals.” The suit also contends  that the rules “will severely disrupt … hospitals’ ability to provide comprehensive, high-quality services by starving them of the resources they need to perform their critical roles.” 
A spokesman for the California Health and Human Services Agency, which oversees the affordability office, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. 
In 2022, state lawmakers created the affordability office with the goal of containing skyrocketing health care costs. More than half of Californians have reported skipping medical care because it costs too much, and 38% report carrying medical debt. In California, health care spending reached $405 billion in 2020 — or $10,299 per person — a 30% increase over five years. 
The office’s appointed board, noting that median household income in California grows an average of 3% annually, set spending targets for hospitals and other providers that aim to match the rise in consumer income. The rules limit spending growth to 3.5% beginning in 2025, and then lower the cap to 3% annually, starting in four years. 
Eight other states have targets similar to California’s rules. In California, hospitals and providers are required to submit spending data to the state to show compliance. Beginning in 2028, the state can enforce spending targets with performance improvement plans and fines. 
The affordability board’s approval of the growth caps was contentious, with one board member saying the target was unrealistic. 
Office’s regulators have since also reduced the limits further for seven hospitals, calling them “high-cost” for consumers. For these facilities, including Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto and Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, regulators set spending growth targets of 1.8% in 2026 and 1.6% in four years. 
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services like maternity care, cancer treatment, behavioral health services, and surgical care,” California Hospital Association president and CEO Carmela Coyle said in a statement.
In its suit, the association estimates that the state’s spending target will force 75% of its members to operate at a loss. The policy, the group argues, ignores the rising cost pressures on hospitals, including labor, pharmaceutical prices and a rapidly aging population. In addition, hospitals estimate that a federal spending law will result in billions in losses over the next 10 years, as federal funding and reimbursement for patient care is cut or reduced. 
The statewide target also applies to large doctor groups and health insurers. The California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers, responded to the hospital association’s lawsuit by saying the state cannot reach its goal of making health care more affordable “unless everyone is part of the solution.” The lawsuit, according to the group, “demonstrates [hospitals’] lack of commitment to the affordability that Californians urgently need.”
Consumer advocates who back the industry spending targets slammed the hospital association’s lawsuit, calling it “outrageous.” 
“For years, health care costs have vastly outpaced inflation and wage growth, with very little to show for it — our higher costs don’t translate to better quality of care, outcomes, equity, or access,” said Amanda McAllister, the executive director of the consumer group Health Access California. That’s why, she said, the state “very thoughtfully” created an affordability office and set rules to control the problem. 
“This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to try to change the rules of the game after the fact because you don’t like the outcome,” she said. Supported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-10-16 00:53:28+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Shapiro visits Lebanon County to celebrate farm preservation milestone,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/agriculture-pa-farms/shapiro-visits-lebanon-county-to-celebrate-farm-preservation-milestone/,"As a result of the Farmland Preservation Program, Pennsylvania has preserved more than 6,600 farms and 650,000 acres of farmland for agricultural use.","Gov. Josh Shapiro visited Lebanon County Wednesday to tout a farmland preservation milestone.
Shapiro announced at Talview Dairy Farm that Pennsylvania has now preserved 6,600 farms and 650,000 acres of farmland for agricultural use, now making Pennsylvania the state with the most farms preserved in the nation.
“I am proud of the fact that we are the top state in the nation for farmland preservation,” Shapiro said. “And this work is critical. More and more of our family farms can stay farms forever.”
“Listen, preservation is critically important,” he added. “The future of agriculture is absolutely critical.”
This is a result of the Farmland Preservation Program, which was created in 1988 as a partnership between all levels of government and non-profit organizations, with the intention of saving farmland.
Since then, Pennsylvania has invested more than $1.78 billion in partnership with county and local governments to protect these farmlands from sprawl and development. Shapiro’s administration has invested more than $140 million into this program, since he took office.
Brent Copenhaver and his wife Stacey own Talview Dairy Farm, a dairy operation in Lebanon County, and sell most of their milk regionally in Pennsylvania. They are currently milking about 400 cows and farm approximately 400 acres they purchased from Stacey’s parents.
Their farm was preserved in 1994 as a part of this program.
“Preserving farmland ensures agriculture stays part of Pennsylvania’s economy,” Brent Copenhaver said. “As far as local food, local jobs, and just community, in general.”
“When you protect a farm, you’re not only saving open space, you are protecting the values, the work ethic, and the opportunities that farms pass on from generation to generation,” he added.
Lebanon County has preserved about 22,000 acres of farmland since the creation of this program, with another 2,000 acres in the process of preservation.
Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding and Shapiro lauded that the program has been continued by Democratic and Republican administrations, as proof the effort to preserve farmland is a bipartisan issue.
According to Shapiro’s administration, agriculture contributes $132 billion to the commonwealth’s economy annually and supports nearly 600,000 jobs in the state.
But, Shapiro said, the Trump administration’s trade policies put the commonwealth’s agriculture sector at risk.
Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, Shapiro has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump’s tariff policy.
When talking to farmers about their concerns, Shapiro said he often hears that they want more capital and they’re worried about the workforce. He also said they’ve expressed concern about tariffs.
“I think we’re seeing the tariffs really hurt our farmers here in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star. “We’ve seen, for example, those who work in, you know, the forestry industry, they’ve lost 35% of their market in just the six months or so since those tariffs have been in place.”
“We’ve seen a number of our dairy farmers be more and more and more concerned about losing market share, particularly with Mexico,” he added. “I think these tariffs are just hurting our farmers, maybe more than any other sector.”
Farmers, Shapiro said, are bearing the brunt of the impact of tariffs.
Republican officials who support Trump’s tariff policies believe it will have a positive impact and protect American agriculture and jobs.
According to Axios, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said a “clever and generous” bailout for farmers could be coming as soon as the government shutdown ends, in response to the impact felt by tariffs. There have been reports that the bailout could be at least $10 billion.
During Trump’s first term, about $25 billion from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was used to give direct payments to farmers impacted by trade disputes with China.
CCC funds are used to implement specific programs established by Congress as well as to carry out activities under the broad authorities of the CCC Charter Act, according to the USDA.
During a visit to Talview Dairy in April, U.S. Agriculture Sec. Brooke Rollins said the administration is prepared to provide relief to farmers “if there is damaging consequences to these (trade) negotiations.”
Shapiro said that he hasn’t seen what the Trump administration is planning to do with a potential bailout, but used it as an opportunity to double down on his criticism of tariff policy.
“I’m not sure why you’d put tariffs in place, shut down markets, drive up costs, and then say to farmers, and here’s some money, not to farm,” Shapiro said to the Capital-Star. “I think what farmers want to do is they want to farm. They want to produce more of their crops. They want to do more.”
“They don’t want to be inhibited,” he added. “And I think what these tariffs have done is really inhibited our farmers and driven up costs for consumers.”
Copenhaver told the Capital-Star that his farm hasn’t personally felt any kind of impact as a result of the tariffs. 
 
What do farmers want?
Copenhaver said right now, like many farmers, the No. 1 issue or concern on farmers’ minds is the price and profitability of agriculture and farming.
“I think everyone wants to be profitable, of course,” he told the Capital-Star.
He said the industry at times faces economic issues, as well as weather-related dilemmas, noting that agriculture is “always very challenging.”
However, Copenhaver said he’d describe the current state of agriculture in Pennsylvania as “very strong.”
“We can go anywhere from poultry to crop farming to beef to dairy. And I feel very fortunate that I am able to farm in Pennsylvania,” he said.
What can the state and federal government do to positively impact agriculture?
“The best thing that state government can do would be get the budget passed,” Copenhaver said. “I think that would be very important as far as some funding for agriculture. I also think it has ramifications on local school districts.”
Pennsylvania’s budget impasse is now over 100 days.
He also called for the federal government to pass a budget as an action to help farmers.",,,,2025-10-15 20:56:57.822349

Patty Murray.
Murray, a Democrat from Washington, hosted the call with three Montanans, state Sen. Cora Neumann; Vicky Byrd, CEO of the Montana Nurses Association; and Rob Gregoire, a retired business owner from Bozeman who relies on ACA tax credits for health care.
Wednesday was the 15th day of a federal government shutdown. Republicans and Democrats are at an impasse in Washington, D.C., and health care subsidies are a key issue in the fight.
Murray said she held the call because families in red states such as Montana are being affected, Republicans in the U.S. Senate are dodging the issue, and Republican lawmakers need to negotiate.
Montana has an all Republican federal delegation, including U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, both of Bozeman.
“This issue is not going to magically disappear,” said Murray, vice chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a senior member and former chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
The U.S. Senate has failed to pass resolutions for a short term fix, and neither Republicans nor Democrats appear ready to make concessions, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau reports.
Democrats argue health care tax credits set to expire at the end of the year need to be extended, but Republican leaders say Democrats first need to fund a stopgap measure.
Byrd said without the tax credits, families and local economies will suffer. More than 67,000 Montanans use the ACA tax credits to afford insurance, according to KFF, a health policy research organization.
Byrd said farmers, ranchers and small business owners that use the ACA marketplace for insurance bring critical revenue that allows rural hospitals to stay afloat.
Those hospitals pay the nurses and providers who care for people in small communities. Citing KFF, she said more than 80% of marketplace enrollees in rural areas rely on the subsidies.
“The stakes couldn’t be higher,” Byrd said.
She said 7,000 Montanans could lose coverage entirely.
Montanans with the tax credits pay an average monthly premium of $145, compared to $635 without the credit, according to Murray’s office.
Nearly 70% of the hospitals in Montana are rural, among the highest in the nation, and those facilities are crucial, Byrd said.
Neumann, a Bozeman Democrat, said Montana has been a success story for rural access to health care, and she said the 2025 Montana Legislature passed Medicaid expansion with bipartisan support.
“We know in a state as large as ours just how vital it is to be able to access rural health care,” said Neumann, who works in the field.
Around the country, as many as 100 rural hospitals have closed, but she said Montana has not lost one.
Neumann said that’s because Montana has cut its uninsured rate in half, reduced the burden of uncompensated care on hospitals by 50%, and in just one year, brought in $475 million in new personal income because of Medicaid expansion.
“Let’s continue this winning streak,” Neumann said.
She said Montana’s own Republican state auditor James Brown signed onto a letter with other auditors across the country calling on Congress to continue the enhanced tax credits that started during the pandemic.
“Auditors know intimately how dangerous these cuts are,” Neumann said.
But Neumann said the federal delegation is not listening to Montanans.
She also said the delegation “has phenomenal health care coverage,” and their intransigence on the matter for others confused her.
“For them to sit pretty in Washington and accept some of the best health care coverage in the country while Montanans lose their coverage just reminds me of how out of touch they are with Montana,” Neumann said.
Spokespeople from the offices of Daines and Sheehy did not respond to emails from the Daily Montanan late Wednesday afternoon about the comments they are hearing from Montanans on health subsidies. Both have blamed Democrats for the shutdown.
Some Republicans believe the subsidies, enhanced during the Covid-19 pandemic, went too far, and they can be discussed after the federal government reopens.
But the leaders on the call Wednesday said the matter is urgent.
Neumann said when people lose coverage, they stop seeking care, end up in the emergency room, and the hospital covers the costs — and the vicious cycle puts hospitals on the ropes, and with them, communities.
She said 56% of Montana’s small businesses rely on the marketplace and Medicaid for coverage, and small businesses could collapse without the support.
Byrd said she only receives form letters back from members of the delegation when she has reached out to them, and Neumann said she has not heard a response to a message she sent when the shutdown started (it wasn’t immediately clear which members of the delegation Neumann, of Bozeman, had sent messages to).
Murray said Republicans “moved heaven and earth” this summer to pass a “tax extender” — temporary tax cuts — for billionaires in just a few short weeks, and Democrats repeatedly asked them to do the same for ACA tax credits, “and they refused.”
People in Idaho started seeing increases Wednesday to their insurance costs, and Montanans will on Nov. 1, she said.
“I”m hearing a lot of stress, apprehension, fear, people who are saying that they’re farmers or ranchers, and they’re on the ACA in Montana, and I know that they are counting on us to do the right thing,” Murray said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1463564287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 20:56:57.822349

It was Mississippi’s second execution of the year and the third in the U.S. this week, following executions Tuesday in Florida and Missouri. Including Crawford, 38 people have been executed in the U.S. this year, and six more executions are scheduled in the nation through the end of the year.
Crawford, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. 
“To my family, I love you,” Crawford said while strapped to a gurney. “I’m at peace. I’ve got God’s peace. … I’ll be in heaven.”
He also said, “To the victim’s family, true closure and true peace, you cannot reach that without God.”
His final words were, “Thank you, God, for giving me the peace that I have.”
In 1994, Crawford was convicted of capital murder and received a death sentence. The next three decades he pursued appeals challenging the sentence, as well as separate sentences for aggravated assault and rape that were used as a basis for the death penalty. 
At the time of the killing, Crawford was days away from a separate trial for sexual and physical violence against two teenage girls. He cut through the screen to the bedroom of Ray’s home and left a ransom note demanding $15,000. 
He took her to a wooded area where he raped her and then stabbed her in the chest. He claimed to experience blackouts but was able to show law enforcement where to find her body. 
On Wednesday, Ray’s mother Mary traveled to Parchman to witness the execution, but her father Tommy was not able to be there because of his health, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported.  
Mary Ray did not offer comment after the execution, but last week she told the Tupelo newspaper that witnessing it would not change a thing. 
“I don’t like the word ‘closure,’” she said. “I have a hole in my heart as big as my heart that will never be closed.”
After the execution, Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch said her office has pursued justice for the Ray family and Crawford’s other victims and prayed they received long-awaited closure. 
Leading up to the execution, Crawford petitioned the U.S Supreme Court to halt the execution. The high court denied his final appeal Wednesday evening. 
The day of the execution he also filed emergency motions to stay the execution with the Mississippi Supreme Court, which were denied by the afternoon. 
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves denied a clemency petition, noting circumstances of the crime and  how Crawford did not claim innocence. 
A consciousness check was performed on Crawford after the first of the three lethal injection drugs were administered, which prison officials said earlier in the day was required at the state’s most recent execution in June. 
In a statement after the execution, Crawford’s attorneys from the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel said he was put to death without receiving a fair trial.
“Despite a legal system that failed him, Charles Crawford (‘Chuck’) spent every day in prison trying to be the best person, family member, friend and Christian he could be,” the statement read.
Crawford’s surviving family members include a sister, his father and stepmother. 
At trial, prosecutors asked several of Crawford’s family members if they still loved him in spite of the crimes and if they wanted him to be executed. They said they love him but don’t support what he did, and that they did not want him to receive the death penalty.
In closing arguments before the death sentence was handed down, prosecutors said the Crawford family shifted blame onto others for his actions and they criticized his mother for a number of actions, including not calling law enforcement earlier, helping him pay for bond and “letting him out” of the house with a shotgun. 
Hours before the execution Wednesday, Parchman Superintendent Marc McClure said Crawford seemed relaxed and visited with his family and a preacher he requested. 
Crawford asked for a double cheeseburger, fries and two desserts – peach cobbler and chocolate ice cream – for his last meal, prison officials said. 
Starting in the afternoon, demonstrators gathered outside the prison gates in the Delta community of Parchman and the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson. 
Organizations including Death Penalty Action and Catholic Mobilizing Network circulated petitions that called on the governor to stop the execution, citing Crawford’s argument about how his trial attorneys admitted his guilt and pursued an insanity defense against his wishes. 
Crawford was the second Mississippi inmate executed this year, following the lethal injection of Richard Jordan in June. The state resumed executions in 2021 after a 12-year hiatus. 
Thirty six people remain on death row in Mississippi, and the attorney general’s office is seeking execution dates for two – Willie Jerome Manning and Robert Simon Jr.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Picture this: You work for a cybersecurity team at a company that’s just had its network filleted open by a cyberattack. Your company’s CEO is calling. The press is calling. Other assorted stakeholders are calling with their immediate concerns. 
That was roughly the intense and hectic scenario described by Douglas Alexander, the director of Rhode Island College’s (RIC) Institute for Cybersecurity & Emerging Technologies, during a Wednesday walkthrough with press and state leaders of the institute’s new cyber range.
“As we all know, sometimes under pressure, we all don’t respond at our best,” Alexander said. 
The new cyber range is designed to help students learn how to perform within the unique gravity and demands of these scenarios in a more realistic way via staged cyber attacks. The range is the latest addition to the cyber institute, which opened in 2023 and is chaired by noted cybersecurity sage and former congressman Jim Langevin, who shared progress images of the range with Gov. Dan McKee earlier this year.
“I felt I was looking at ‘Star Wars’ or something like that,” McKee said during a public ceremony for the range’s grand opening before the walkthrough. 
The range relies on IBM’s Cloud Range platform to simulate cyberattacks and teach students how to respond to them. Simulations displayed as tiles on a screen at the range Wednesday sported difficulty levels ranging from novice to advanced, with titles pulled from real threat actors’ strategies or broader tactics like ransomware or website defacements. 
The Pawtucket-based firm LLB Architects — also enlisted recently by the Department of State to conduct a feasibility study for a state archives building — designed the classroom, which accommodates up to 24 students across four workstations. Each workstation has six computers, outfitted with Dell monitors and Alienware mice and keyboards that, on Wednesday at least, glowed with a futuristic blue. The room’s ceiling is outfitted with LED fixtures in similarly glowing hues, and the front wall sports a 24-foot-wide by 4-foot-tall screen that plays out the simulations.
The cyber range’s network is also isolated from the rest of the RIC network, to prevent spillover of any malware to other computers on campus. The school is also making it available to outside parties for “single-session engagements, annual multi-exercise programs, and comprehensive incident response plan stress tests,” according to an institute press release.










I felt I was looking at ‘Star Wars’ or something like that.


– Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee 


RIC is the third school to use the cyber range as part of the IBM Cyber Campus program, which is the company’s partnership with Cloud Range, the latter’s founder and CEO Debbie Gordon confirmed in an email Wednesday.
Wednesday’s ceremony also included a “powering up” — an electrified equivalent of a ribbon cutting, in which McKee and other state and university leaders joined together to press a big blue button before the cyber range’s 24-foot-wide screen lit up for ostensibly the first time.
Alas, the room has already seen some use this semester, Lindsay Russell, a spokesperson for RIC’s cyber institute, confirmed over phone Wednesday. 
But students and faculty have largely “been dipping their toes in,” Russell said, acquainting themselves with the space, and by next semester the classroom will be more fully integrated into the institute’s curriculum. 
The range’s home is on the first floor of Alger Hall. RIC intends, however, to move the simulation space to Whipple Hall once the renovations there are complete — including about $73 million for the makeovers drawn from the funds voters authorized via a 2024 ballot measure.



More pressure on state and local leaders
During the speaking program before the cyber range’s ceremonial powering on, retired U.S. Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery highlighted the need for cybersecurity education amid looming and numerous international threat actors which are beginning to target U.S. infrastructure more and more frequently. 
“Really complicating this is that right now, Washington is tied up,” Montgomery said. “They’re tied up in knots, and they’re not able to proceed on a lot of these issues. So in my mind, that means the solutions have to push down to the state and local level, to the academics, to the nonprofits, to push these issues, to think of the solutions to drive change.” 
Alexander echoed that sentiment during his demonstration, and recalled a recent “60 Minutes” special that detailed how Littleton, a town of about 10,000 in western Massachusetts, had its electric and water utility system hacked by Volt Typhoon, a prolific cyber crime outfit with ties to the People’s Liberation Army Cyberspace Force. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) first issued an advisory on the group in 2023, outlining Volt Typhoon’s playbook and its purported sponsorship by the People’s Republic of China, which has denied any connections to the group.
Volt Typhoon primarily uses living-off-the-land techniques, according to Microsoft and CISA. That means embedding within a network’s existing administrative toolbox to limit logging, avoid detection and then run scripts as needed. The group is known to use Windows’ native command line to gain a foothold in government and infrastructure networks. 
Volt Typhoon is also one of the simulations available in Cloud Range’s portfolio of exercises at RIC. It’s an advanced level simulation.
“This is the sword of Damocles that China has hanging over us, is ‘We could shut down your critical infrastructure, if we wanted to,’” Alexander said. “That is a heck of a leverage.”
But one does not have to go as far as Beijing or even as close as Massachusetts to find high-profile instances of cybercrime. Alexander gave the now canonical example of a large-scale data breach in Rhode Island, RIBridges. The breach of the state’s public benefits and health insurance marketplace in 2024 siphoned personal information of approximately 650,000 Rhode Islanders from state servers, which Alexander called “a fairly traumatic event for a sizable number of Rhode Island citizens.”
Two of the state’s top IT officials who wrestled with that breach — Chief Information Officer Brian Tardiff and Chief Information Security Officer Nathan Loura — attended Wednesday’s event. Both men left by the time Alexander gave his demo in the cyber range, which gave him permission to sing Tardiff and Loura’s praises.

“They actually were very proud of their command center and how they responded internally to that attack,” Alexander said. “It was a brutal time. It was clearly not optimal for them, but they pulled together.” 
Alexander credited Tardiff and Loura’s performance on the backend of the incident response as grounded in the pair’s “pre-existing relationships with each other that even predated their positions at the state.”
“Now, we still need to get their team in here to really test that out, because we’ve got some advanced scenarios so that could put them to the test,” Alexander said of the state IT team.
That teamwork is what hardens a war room against attack, Alexander said. The cyber range is geared toward giving students “a fairly immersive, pressure filled situation,” he said, which will replicate the intensity of a real-time cyberattack, rather than the abstraction of tabletop scenarios. 
Alexander likened tabletop scenarios to a game of Dungeon & Dragons — a pattern of action and response with a predictable pace, something lacking the “hands-on” experience a simulation can provide. 
“Those poor professional skills are often the make or break differentiator between a successful defense and a failed defense, or an attack that goes on for too long,” Alexander said.
The cyber range’s post-scenario evaluations include a rubric to indicate the quality of teamwork during a given exercise. Perhaps a team does well overall, but individual members didn’t communicate well with others or had conflicts that impacted their work.
“These are all very human responses, especially under pressure,” Alexander said. “But if we can do that in a safe space…we’re much better off than if that happens in a real life attack.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Pulaski County circuit judge said she would issue a ruling quickly in a lawsuit seeking to move up the dates of the Senate District 26 special election after a hearing Wednesday.
The lawsuit, which attorney Jennifer Waymack Standerfer filed last week in Pulaski County Circuit Court on behalf of Franklin County resident Colt Shelby, seeks an earlier date for a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield. The suit alleges the current schedule prevents District 26 voters from having a voice during the 2026 fiscal session, which begins in April.
The attorney general’s office is representing the defendants, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester. During Wednesday’s hearing, Senior Assistant Attorney General Ryan Hale said the case should be dismissed because the plaintiff failed to state a claim and because of sovereign immunity, the legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
Franklin County resident sues to move up election to fill Arkansas senator’s seat

Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James said she understood the time-sensitivity of the case at the end of the two-hour hearing Wednesday, but didn’t issue a ruling.
“I know it’s important to everyone here” that a decision be made in the case soon, James told the packed courtroom. “It will be quick.”
In an amended complaint filed Tuesday, Standerfer asked the court to order Sanders to schedule the special election “on the earliest date” possible prior to the 2026 fiscal session, while still complying with election laws and deadlines.
Hale argued the court does not have the authority to grant the plaintiff’s request.
“Specifically, the Court has no authority to set the timeline for the special election,” Hale wrote in court documents. “And to the extent a declaration is based on an equitable request for relief, the Court does not have authority to declare that the special election must occur in advance of the 2026 fiscal session, that the Governor failed to follow the law concerning vacancies, or that the Governor’s determinations related to the special election were ‘untimely and violative of law.’”
State law requires a special election be held within 150 days of a legislative vacancy, unless the governor finds it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
Standerfer argued Wednesday that the issue was “largely” a question of law, because Sanders “neglected” to explain her reason for determining that holding the election sooner was not possible or too burdensome.
State law gives Sanders the authority to determine if the 150-day requirement is impracticable or too burdensome, Hale said, not the courts. There is no requirement in the special election law that Sanders justify her use of the exception, so the governor’s decision is not challengable, Hale argued.
Numerous special elections over the last 15 years have gone past the 150-day mark, but Sanders’ proposed schedule for Stubblefield’s seat is the longest by far, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Sanders originally scheduled the special primary and general elections for the seat on March 3 and Nov. 3 of next year, coinciding with the state’s regular midterm election schedule. After bipartisan pushback, she revised the general election date to June 9.
Much of that criticism focused on a lack of representation for residents of District 26, which includes parts of Franklin County where the state has proposed building a 3,000-bed prison. During the fiscal session that starts in April, lawmakers are likely to vote on funding for the controversial project, which is expected to cost $825 million, according to preliminary estimates. Many locals living near the site are staunchly opposed to the prison, and an appropriations bill for the project failed five times during the 2025 legislative session.
The state did not call any witnesses during the hearing, while Standerfer called six — Shelby; Stubblefield’s daughter, Amber Sullivan; Republican Sen. Bryan King of Green Forest, an outspoken critic of the proposed prison; and three election workers from Franklin and Logan counties.
Jo Dawn Carter, Logan County’s election coordinator, testified that the longer it took to set election dates, the more work it would be to ensure the county was prepared. However, Carter said Logan County election officials would do everything necessary to ensure a smooth election if the dates are moved up.
In an interview with the Advocate after the hearing, Carter said she’d already begun preparing for if the election dates are changed.

While the Trump administration and Montana’s elected officials continue pushing to expand the state’s coal industry, companies on the ground appear to have a waning appetite. 
The federal government recently rejected a bid on a new coal lease offered for 167 million tons of coal from Montana’s Powder River Basin and postponed a sale in Wyoming scheduled for last week. 
Navajo Transitional Energy Company was the only company to submit a bid for the lease in Montana for $186,000 for federal coal near the company’s Spring Creek Mine in Big Horn County. That works out to just a fraction of a penny per ton, and well below what the Bureau of Land Management estimates as the market value. 
The last federal coal lease sale in the region went for $1.10 per ton, according to federal data, for a total of $793 million for 721 million tons, back in 2012. At the same price, a bid for the Spring Creek lease would generate more than $183 million.  
Navajo Transitional Energy operates the Spring Creek Mine in the area, which the federal government approved for expansion earlier this year, allowing access to an additional 39.9 million tons of coal, which could keep the mine operational for up to 16 more years. 
Wyofile previously reported that Navajo Transitional had warned that market value for coal in the Powder River Basin was far below previous valuations, and in documents submitted before the bid said that one reason included low forecasts for selling the coal, as many coal-fired power plants in the region are set to go offline in the next two decades. 
The Bureau of Land Management rejected NTEC’s offer for the Spring Creek lease, saying it did not meet the requirements of the federal Minerals Leasing Act, which requires a fair-market value for any federal lease. 
In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the BLM determines fair market value through “a rigorous process that includes economic modeling, analysis of comparable sales, and current market conditions to ensure taxpayers receive a fair return.”
“The BLM remains committed to supporting responsible coal development as part of a balanced approach to managing public lands and resources,” the department said. 
Funds from federal coal leases are split between the federal government and the state where the coal is mined, but part of the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” lowered the federal coal royalty rate from 12.8% to 7%, decreasing how much money Montana is set to earn from each lease. 
The low offer for the Spring Creek lease prompted BLM to postpone another auction on a 441 million ton West Antelope III federal lease in Wyoming. Navajo Transitional also requested the sale in association with its Antelope coal mine, and was reportedly the only party interested in bidding. 
“While we had hoped for stronger participation, the postponed West Antelope III coal lease sale in Wyoming underscores the lasting damage from the Obama-Biden administration’s decades-long war on coal, which aimed to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry,” an Interior spokesperson wrote in an email. “Under President Trump, the Department of the Interior and BLM are restoring trust between government and industry as part of the broader push for American Energy Dominance.”
The West Antelope III sale has yet to be rescheduled. 
 Mining for Montana’s benefit

The low interest in coal leases comes as the Trump administration and Congress, with the support of all four members of Montana’s delegation have moved to greatly expand the potential offerings across the West. 
Last year, the Biden administration had announced that it would be halting much coal leasing in eastern Montana, and had made steps toward stopping coal leasing on federal tracts of land due to concerns about climate change.
But just last week, the U.S. Senate voted to roll back the Biden-era Resource Management Plan (RMP) amendment for the Miles City BLM office, spanning most of eastern Montana, which had prohibited future coal leases in the region. The U.S. House voted in favor of the amendment in September, with both of Montana’s representatives joining the Republican majority. 
“Montana energy is back,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a press release. “Mining is a vital part of Montana, providing nearly a thousand well-paying jobs and contributing nearly $3 billion to our state’s economy. That’s why I introduced a bill along with the rest of our Montana delegation to remove this anti-energy rule and support Montana’s coal miners.”
Daines did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market and Montana’s financial coffers. 
Montana’s Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte had also supported reopening eastern Montana for coal leasing, saying it was essential to the state’s economy and revenue. Montana supplies 5% of the nation’s coal and derives 37% of energy generation from coal-fired power plants.  
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote in a letter to the Trump administration. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.”
Gianforte’s office did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market for Montana coal and the state’s financial benefit. 
Conservation groups decried the move by Congress to overturn the resource management plan, saying that it came about through a multi-year public process, but was revoked through a single vote. 
“It’s an egregious example of rich politicians thinking they know better than locals and experts. By legislating day-to-day management, Congress is hijacking careful planning and stewardship developed by local communities and experts,” said Alex Blackmer, with Wild Montana. “This reckless move puts not just one plan, but hundreds of land plans nationwide at risk of Congressional interference, unleashing chaos and uncertainty on ranchers, hunters, hikers, anglers, and businesses that depend on our public lands.”
Additional resource management plans from the Biden administration that banned future coal leasing, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, are also being challenged in Congress. 
In Montana, Gianforte has continued to push for expanding energy production in the state, most recently by convening an energy task force to “unleash American-made energy,” following Trump’s executive orders to bolster nationwide domestic fossil fuel energy sources.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-15 23:51:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,US Supreme Court seems inclined to limit race-based electoral districts under the Voting Rights Act,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/15/supreme-court-race-based-electoral-districts-voting-rights-act/,The U.S. Supreme Court appears ready to gut a key tool of the Voting Rights Act that has helped root out racial discrimination in voting for more than a half century.,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared ready to gut a key tool of the Voting Rights Act that has helped root out racial discrimination in voting for more than a half century, a change that would boost Republican electoral prospects, particularly across the South.
During more than two hours of arguments, the court’s six conservative justices seemed inclined to effectively strike down a majority-Black congressional district in Louisiana because it relied too heavily on race.
Such an outcome would mark a fundamental change in the 1965 voting rights law, the centerpiece legislation of the Civil Rights Movement, that succeeded in opening the ballot box to Black Americans and reducing persistent discrimination in voting.
A ruling for Louisiana could open the door for legislatures to redraw congressional maps in southern states, helping Republican electoral prospects by eliminating majority Black and Latino districts that tend to favor Democrats. Legislatures already are free to draw extremely partisan districts, subject only to review by state courts, because of a 2019 Supreme Court decision.
In September, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch filed papers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to to sharply curtail the federal Voting Rights Act by limiting who can sue to enforce protection against racial discrimination at the ballot box. 
Fitch, a Republican, is appealing a federal district court judge’s ruling that said state lawmakers must redraw the three Mississippi Supreme Court districts because they dilute Black voting strength. The district court judge’s ruling forbids the state from using the current maps in future Mississippi Supreme Court elections. It is pending before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the appellate court has paused all proceedings in the appeal until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on redistricting cases.
Just two years ago, the nation’s highest court, by a 5-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that found a likely violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in a case over Alabama’s political boundaries. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined their three more liberal colleagues in the outcome.
Roberts and Kavanaugh struck a different tone Wednesday, especially in their questions to civil rights lawyer Janai Nelson.
The chief justice suggested the Alabama decision was tightly focused on its facts and should not be read to require a similar outcome in Louisiana.
Kavanaugh pressed Nelson on whether the time has come to end the use of race-based districts under the Voting Rights Act, rather than “allowing it to extend forever.”
The court’s liberal justices focused on the history of the Voting Rights Act in combating discrimination. Getting to the remedy of redrawing districts only happens if, as Justice Elena Kagan said, a court finds “a specific identified, proved violation of law.”
A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting already is playing out across the nation after Republican President Donald Trump began urging Texas and other GOP-controlled states to redraw their lines to make it easier for the GOP to hold its narrow majority in the House.
The court’s conservative majority has been skeptical of considerations of race, most recently ending affirmative action in college admissions. Twelve years ago, the court bludgeoned another pillar of the landmark voting law that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get advance approval from the Justice Department or federal judges before making election-related changes.
The court has separately given state legislatures wide berth to gerrymander for political purposes. If the Supreme Court now weakens or strikes down the Voting Rights Act’s Section 2, states would not be bound by any limits in how they draw electoral districts. Such a result would be expected to lead to extreme gerrymandering by whichever party is in power at the state level.

The court’s Alabama decision in 2023 led to new districts there and in Louisiana that sent two more Black Democrats to Congress.
Now, though, the court has asked the parties to answer a fundamental question: “Whether the state’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.”
Louisiana and the Trump administration joined with a group of white voters in arguing to invalidate the challenged district and make it much harder to claim discrimination in redistricting.
The arguments led Justice Sonia Sotomayor to assert that the administration’s “bottom line is just get rid of Section 2.”
Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan disagreed and said state lawmakers would have no incentive to get rid of every majority-Black district because doing so would create swing districts and imperil some Republican incumbents.
In addition, Mooppan said, only 15 of the 60 Black members of the House represent majority-Black districts. “But even if you eliminated Section 2 entirely, fully 75% of the Black congressmen in this country are in districts that are not protected by Section 2.”
In the first arguments in the Louisiana case in March, Roberts sounded skeptical of the second majority-Black district, which last year elected Democratic Rep. Cleo Fields. Roberts described the district as a “snake” that stretches more than 200 miles to link parts of the Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge areas.
The court fight over Louisiana’s congressional districts has lasted three years. The state’s Republican-dominated legislature drew a new congressional map in 2022 to account for population shifts reflected in the 2020 census. But the changes effectively maintained the status quo of five Republican-leaning, majority-white districts and one Democratic-leaning, majority-Black district.
Civil rights advocates won a lower-court ruling that the districts likely discriminated against Black voters.
Louisiana eventually drew a new map to comply with the court ruling and protect its influential Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. But white Louisiana voters claimed in their separate lawsuit that race was the predominant factor driving it. A three-judge court agreed, leading to the current high court case.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule by early summer in 2026.

Gianforte signed House Bill 127, which increases funding in the state’s fire suppression fund. It also mandates the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation submit a report on expenditures made under the Fire Suppression Account.
Gianforte said the bill gives more flexibility to the state in regards to fire suppression. Montana pursed an “aggressive” attack on the fires that did pop up this year, he added. Very few fires grew larger than 5,000 acres in the state this past year and about 100,000 acres in total burned, Gianforte said.
“That’s a credit to really DNRC and local fire companies for getting after it,” Gianforte said. “And we got a lot better cooperation from the Forest Service this year than we have in past years.”
House Bill 130, also from Jones, stipulates that the state has a duty to engage in fire suppression regardless of land ownership. It also allows the state to bill the federal agency responsible for the land where a wildfire occurred to reimburse state and county costs associated with the blaze.
“Through House Bill 130, we are able to work with DNRC to respond quickly to all fire starts to execute an aggressive initial attack regardless of who owns the land of where the fire started,” Jones, said in a press release.

Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Green shirts filled a hearing room in Lincoln full of Nebraskans who support the legalization of medical cannabis but oppose the regulations of the product proposed by the state’s new Medical Cannabis Commission.
Thirty-two people testified against the proposed regulations Wednesday. None spoke in support. Testifiers argued the regulations would not be feasible for most people needing medical cannabis, and roughly half called out commissioners for not attending the hearing to listen to their concerns.
“I feel like Nebraska just wants to make it as uncomfortable and unbearable as possible,” said testifier Nathan Brown.
In 2024’s general election, 71% of Nebraska voters voted to legalize medical cannabis, and 67% voted to create the new regulatory commission. Since December, Nebraskans have been able to legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, so long as they have a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
However, medical cannabis can’t yet be legally purchased in the state. Just last week, the Medical Cannabis Commission granted two of its four cultivator licenses to Nancy Laughlin-Wagner of Omaha and to Patrick Thomas of Raymond. Chief Legal Officer for Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services Bo Botelho said both licenses had been accepted.
In September, the commission advanced a stricter set of regulations in comparison to emergency regulations the group approved in June. Gov. Jim Pillen accepted the new regulations with one revision — to limit cultivators from growing more than 1,250 flowering plants at one time.
Advocates for medical cannabis gather before a public hearing at the Nebraska State Office Building in Lincoln, Nebraska, on state-drafted regulations for the new medicine Nebraska voters approved in November 2024. Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The revised regulations would, for the first time, set extensive testing and security requirements and establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” for in-state physicians to recommend medical cannabis. If approved, the rules would remain in effect for up to 90 days.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. But they could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within a 90-day period. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
Several testifiers said this limit was too restrictive. Testifer Shari Lawlor said a single joint usually weighs about 1 gram, so expecting people with medical needs to be limited to 5 grams of THC over 90 days is impractical.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who testified at the hearing, went a step further and called the limit a bold violation from the ballot language voters approved in November, which allowed possession of up to five ounces.
Testifiers largely agreed that the proposed regulations go against what voters asked for. Several argued it tells them the people tasked with drafting the regulations lacked an understanding of medical cannabis.
Crista Eggers, campaign manager for the Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana initiatives, brought a large stack of papers representing the roughly 240,000 signatures gathered between both petitions as a visual example of the level of public support for medical cannabis.
“I will guarantee you that every single one of them wished they could be here today,” she said. “You know what, they shouldn’t have to be. They did their part. Voters spoke.”

Some testifiers criticized the limits on acceptable forms of medical cannabis. The proposed regulations exclude smoking and vaping.
Edward Williams, a veteran and member of the Legal Marijuana Now Party, said smoking or vaping is the most effective method of treating him when he wakes up from nightmares due to his PTSD. The key factor is that smoking and vaping is quicker to take effect than other forms of cannabis, such as edibles.
“You can’t really wake up with nightmares or flashbacks and expect to have to wait for an hour or two for an edible to work,” Williams said.
Williams wasn’t the only veteran to testify. Several others spoke about how medical cannabis has benefitted them and said they have lost friends to suicide who didn’t have access to the same treatment.
A majority of Wednesday’s testifiers offered emotional stories about how medical cannabis can alleviate painful ailments for them or their relatives. They described medical cannabis as a safer and cheaper option than other pain relief treatments.
“Instead of needing to put my mother on morphine at the end of her life, where she then went into a coma just to control her pain, we could have had a meaningful and loving last few days had she been prescribed medical cannabis,” said testifer Kathy Jensen.
Registered Nurse Tracey Davidson, who did not testify but attended the hearing, said she was first exposed to the benefits of cannabis when her brother-in-law was diagnosed with cancer about 12 years ago. Because he lived in Colorado, he had access to medical cannabis, and she said he credited that as part of the reason he could continue working and biking until days before his death.
“I view cannabis as medicine,” Davidson said. “I’ve seen it work through my career for a lot of different situations, from pain management, to sleep, to PTSD.”
Many testifiers also criticized the three active medical cannabis commissioners for not attending the hearing, calling it “shameful” and “insulting.” The hearing was required under statute.
Some testifiers even accused members of being “bought off” by anti-marijuana politicians. At a commission meeting several weeks ago, testifier Georganna Schroeder-Stanley said she observed “indifference, boredom and even contempt” on the faces of some commissioners listening to public feedback.

Cavanaugh interviewed the appointees for the commission as part of his duties as a state senator. He said his “fears have come true,” from those interviews — that members are “pursuing a political agenda” that aligns with Pillen’s.
Chair Monica Oldenburg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Several other testifiers said that Nebraska is missing out on much-needed revenue. Brown argued this is silly considering how easy it is for Nebraskans to access cannabis by crossing state lines.
Brown said Nebraska would lose residents because of the government’s resistance to accepting medical cannabis. Another testifier, Dawn Weir, said she moved back to Nebraska this year because she’d heard that medical cannabis had been legalized.
The aftermath of the 2024 ballot initiatives has made some testifiers question whether they should continue voting if the state can interfere so easily. Cavanaugh pleaded with attendees to continue voting, but urged them to vote for people “who actually respect you.”
Proponents of medical cannabis have long argued the issue is nonpartisan, and several testifiers identified themselves as registered Republicans who either regret voting Republican in 2024, or are reconsidering their party affiliation.
“I don’t know how long (my Republican registration) is going to last with watching this state going so far to the other side,” said testifier John Reagan.
With the hearing concluded, the commission will decide whether to formally adopt the regulations or make changes. If finalized, the regulations would be sent to Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ office for legal review. Pillen would have the final say. Hilgers’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Smitty’s Supply Inc. has filed a lawsuit against two companies it blames for the August fire and explosion that destroyed the facility and caused an environmental disaster in Tangipahoa Parish.
The company filed the lawsuit Tuesday in the 21st Judicial District Court in Amite against Fulton Thermal Corp., a New York-based company that manufactures industrial boiler tanks, and J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services of Baton Rouge, which installs and maintains the tanks.
The lawsuit alleges Fulton sold Smitty’s a defective boiler tank, which they call a “thermal fluid heater,” though the pleading does not specify what was wrong with the unit. In the filing, Smitty’s suggests the boiler malfunctioned, exploded and caused the fire.
Tangipahoa Parish Robby Miller told the Illuminator in a Sept. 8 interview that the facility first caught fire and then exploded.
According to the lawsuit, Smitty’s purchased the boiler in 2021 and “regularly inspected and serviced” it but never noticed any defects. The lawsuit doesn’t state how the company became aware of any alleged defects with the boiler.
The lawsuit includes similarly unspecific claims against J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services, claiming the company was negligent in installing and maintaining the boiler unit but does not say exactly how.  
“The injuries and damages which occurred herein were caused, in part, by the negligence of J&M and by the negligent installation and/or maintenance of J&M,” the lawsuit states.
Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside firm, reviewed Smitty’s Supply’s legal filing on Wednesday and said the claims will likely have difficulty succeeding in court.

“It’s hard to say whether Fulton Thermal or J&M had any role in causing the explosion based on the allegations in this lawsuit,” Garside said. “There doesn’t seem to be a single factual allegation about anyone other than Smitty’s.”
Calls and emails to the sued companies were not returned Wednesday, though Jean Windown, J&M Boiler’s president, told WVUE-TV Fox 8 that it hasn’t worked with Smitty’s Supply for several years.
Through a news release from a public relations firm, Smitty’s Supply said Tuesday that it is focusing on supporting the “safe and efficient cleanup efforts” of the government agencies that have responded. 
The Aug. 22 fire and explosion at the Smitty’s Supply plant, which manufactures, bottles and distributes petrochemical products for automotive and industrial retailers, resulted in a chemical blaze that took two weeks to fully extinguish. The incident sent smoke, soot and oily residue into the air and onto nearby homes, businesses and an elementary school. 
Hazardous materials from the plant spilled into area waterways, including several adjacent ponds and the Tangipahoa River. Oil-based chemicals have flowed nearly 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say the lake hasn’t been affected. 
The Environmental Protection Agency still has crews cleaning up and decontaminating the area. The agency is also still analyzing water samples from area waterways. EPA Regional Administrator Mason Scott has said the cleanup would not be affected by the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The federal agency has relinquished the destroyed facility back to Smitty’s Supply. In a news release Wednesday, the company said it will begin an EPA-approved remediation plan at the site.
Meanwhile, town officials in Independence, 15 miles south of the Smitty’s plant, have approved permits to allow the company to set up shop at a storage facility, WVUE reported. The site will only be used for storage and not to blend products, a Smitty’s representative told the news station.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 23:10:19+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: High summer temperatures at state prisons threaten inmates’ health,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/ct-prison-ombuds-report-heat-osborn-bridgeport-hartford/,The report found high indoor temperatures is risking the health of incarcerated individuals and may violate their constitutional rights.,"High indoor temperatures combined with a lack of cold drinking water and cooling fans in three of the state’s prisons during the summer months is risking the health of incarcerated individuals and may violate their constitutional rights, according to a new report from the Corrections Ombuds.  
The report, released Wednesday, details observations from the three facilities without air conditioning — Hartford Correctional Center, Bridgeport Correctional Center and Osborn Correctional Institution — during late June and July. Combined, the three facilities house about 2,700 people. 
Corrections Ombuds DeVaughn Ward said in the report that his office has received multiple complaints from incarcerated people and their families about the heat. One mother who wrote to the ombuds on July 24 complained that her son, who was housed at Osborn, had contracted scabies and was being frequently kept in his cell on lockdown without a fan or air conditioning.
“The officers come around every few hours with semi-cold water to cool off during this heat wave, but it’s still uncomfortably hot,” she wrote.
Another mother who said her son was housed at Osborn wrote that the heat was exacerbating her son’s asthma and making it difficult for him to breathe. 
On a 96-degree day in late June, Ward visited Bridgeport Correctional Center and found that overcrowding was forcing people to be housed in the facility’s gym, where there were no fans and no ice water. Other blocks where incarcerated people lived were also lacking water and fans. 
“In other units, fans were observed stored under stairwells and not deployed despite high temperatures and residents being out of their cells, and some fans that were in use were covered in debris,” Ward wrote. 
When Ward returned to Bridgeport Correctional for an unannounced visit in early July, more than fifty people were being housed in the gym because of a plumbing problem. The gym had a single small fan and one cooler with “minimal” water for drinking. 
A visit in late July found water and ice available across the facility, and the department had purchased fans and distributed them across the facility. 
In Osborn Correctional Institution on June 24, certain housing blocks recorded temperatures above 90 degrees, with several more hitting temperatures above 80 degrees. During a second visit a few days later, Ward reported seeing drinking water in some blocks but not in others. Incarcerated individuals also told him that staff members would turn fans off “as a form of retaliation.” 
Ward warned in his report that extreme heat conditions could be viewed by a court as a violation of the Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment, particularly in light of a recent case filed in a district court in Texas claiming that excessive heat in the prisons there may violate the constitutional rights of prisoners. The case is still ongoing.
The State of Connecticut has already approved two HVAC projects at Bridgeport Correctional Center and Hartford Correctional Center, which are scheduled to be completed in 2027. But at Osborn, where estimates for the cost of retrofitting the institution hover between $76 million and $85 million, the state has opted to expand the use of generator-powered air conditioning units instead of investing in a complete overhaul. 
In a statement to CT Mirror, Department of Correction Spokesperson Andrius Banevicius said that Commissioner Angel Quiros had received the report and was preparing a response. He said that while upkeep of the “aging infrastructure” in the prison buildings “presents significant and costly challenges,” the department was in the process of carrying out the upgrades Ward mentioned in his report. 
Ward recommended that the Department of Correction develop maximum and minimum temperatures for the facilities, keep hourly temperature logs, ensure that fans are fixed before the summer months, allow inmates to take more showers during heat waves and make sure that bedding and laundry are washed weekly to lower the risk of skin infections and funguses.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201118_PrisonRally_Hartford_KIM_09.jpg,,,2025-10-15 20:56:57.822349

(Source NM file art) It remains to be seen if the 2026 race for New Mexico governor will break the fundraising record set in 2022, but the two Democratic frontrunners have already pulled in millions of dollars in campaign contributions, according to the latest filings with the New Mexico Secretary of State.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, also a Democrat, can’t run again due to term limits. Her last general election against Republican Mark Ronchetti in 2022 broke campaign spending records. She raised nearly $13 million and he raised more than $9 million.
Deb Haaland, a former U.S. Secretary of the Interior and previous member of the U.S. House of Representatives for New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, reported in a news release raising a little over $4 million in campaign contributions in the last six months. However, Haaland’s full report was not publicly available on the Secretary of State’s website by the state filing deadline of Oct. 14. A campaign spokesperson told Source NM via email: the report “was so large it overwhelmed the SOS website,” and also said it could not be shared through email.
The most recent filing date covers donations and spending in between April and September. The next reports will be due next year.
Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver confirmed in a text message to Source NM Haaland’s recent filing was too large for the system and said the state has been “working with them and the vendor to get it parsed properly so we can upload.” As of the end of the day Wednesday, Haaland’s report had not yet appeared on the site.
In a statement about the donations, Haaland thanked her supporters, noting she has received more than 21,000 donations from New Mexicans since announcing her campaign in January.
“I look forward to continuing to travel the state, hearing directly from New Mexicans about their struggles, and what they want to see in plans for affordability, healthcare, education, and public safety,” she said.
Source will provide reporting on Haaland’s top donors when the report becomes available.
Her closest competitor contribution-wise, Sam Bregman, has raised $2.4 million in campaign contributions since April. Of the more than 2,240 recorded donations, about 20% were from out-of-state contributors. Bregman, the top prosecutor for the 2nd Judicial District in Bernalillo County, announced his candidacy in April.
“This campaign is powered by New Mexicans who want a candidate with a real common-sense plan for the future.” Bregman said in a statement. “As the outsider in this race, nobody expected us to raise this kind of money. But I’ve never been one to shy away from hard work. This incredible show of support proves folks are ready for something new.”
Bregman’s largest campaign donors include New York Investment firm Garnett Station Partners and the Sunland Park Racetrack and Casino; and Thomas Jorden, the CEO at Texas oil company Coterra Energy. His son, Boston Sox third baseman Alex Bregman also donated the maximum: $12,400.

The third Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ken Miyagishima, the former longtime mayor of Las Cruces and insurance salesman, raised just over $19,000 since April, and loaned his campaign more than $50,000.
In a call with Source NM, Miyagishima said he planned to ramp up fundraising in the next month.
“If you look at all my previous elections, I probably financed about 80% to 90% of them,” he said. “That’s not the preferred method, but I just have a hard time asking people for money.”
Of the four announced Republican candidates, Rio Rancho Mayor Greggory Hull pulled in the most donations — just over $123,000 since April. His top donors include Brady Lovelady, owner of Perfection Honda in Rio Rancho; retired business owner Nancy Nunnally from Rio Rancho; and Roswell car dealership owners Tom and Linda Krumland.
“Our campaign is proud to have raised over $329,000, the most of any candidate in the Republican primary,” Hull said in a statement to Source NM. “Considering that we reached this milestone before even announcing, we’re encouraged by the level of support and momentum behind this campaign.”

Three other Republican candidates who have filed paperwork to run, but have not declared formal campaigns yet, all reported no expenditures or donations in the last six months.
They include Brian Cillessen, a 53-year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host; and Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson. Las Cruces personal trainer and businesswoman Belinda Robertson did not file a report.
Two candidates have declared a campaign for governor without political party affiliation. Jacob Smith, a Rio Rancho resident, reported a sole donation of $2,000 from himself. Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs, reported two donations from himself, and a donation of $1.25 from an Alamogordo resident.
New Mexico’s primary election will be held June 2, 2026.

Vanessa E. Atterbeary (D-Howard), left, hugs House Speaker Adrienne Jones after Atterbeary kicked off her campaign for Howard County executive Wednesday in Columbia. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Wednesday was a busy day in the Democratic race to succeed Howard County Executive Calvin Ball, a race that was already busy to being with.
Del. Vanessa Atterbeary officially kicked off her campaign before a packed crowd at Columbia’s Harriet Tubman Cultural Center, become the latest candidate to join Howard County Councilmember Deb Jung, County Council Chair Liz Walsh and Del. Jessica Feldmark (D-Howard) in the Democratic primary that will be held next June.
Not to be outdone, Feldmark unveiled endorsements Wednesday from high-ranking current and former Howard County officials, including Ken Ulman, former Del. Shane Pendergrass, Del. Pam Guzzone (D-Howard), Board of Education member Andrea Chamblee and county Register of Wills Byron Macfarlane. Ulman, who stepped down this year as chairman of the Maryland Democratic Party, served as county executive from 2006-2014, and Feldmark was his chief of staff for much of that time,
“Howard County is facing threats from a hostile federal administration and an uncertain economic future. Jessica’s experience and leadership will ensure we remain a thriving community for all Howard County residents,” said Ulman, who said he was “thrilled” to endorse Feldmark, who has served in the House of Delegates since 201i9.
Pendergrass praised Feldmark for “both her competence and her compassion” and said she knows “how Howard County works more than anyone and is the only person ready to take on the job of County Executive on day one.”
But Feldmark has to get past her primary opponents first, not the least of which is Atterbeary, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who highlighted her work in the legislature as she began making her case Wednesday for the county’s top job.

“I am a daughter, I am a sister, I am a mother. I am a native Howard Countian,” Atterbeary told a packed crowd. “I have lived here my whole life, born and raised, and I’m here tonight to tell all of you that I am running to be your next county executive.”
She pointed to her work on police accountability reform, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future and gun violence prevention, in particular.
“Everything that we’ve been able to pass at the state level needs to be implemented correctly at the local level, whether we’re talking about schools, whether we’re talking about funds that we get from the state,” Atterbeary said. “I was the only person in the race that was in those actual rooms, making those negotiations and working on the actual legislation.”
Atterbeary touted endorsements of her own Wednesday, from State Treasurer Dereck E. Davis, Howard County Councilmember Opel Jones and C. Vernon Gray, the first Black man to be elected to the Howard County Council. House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones was also among the legislators who showed up for the announcement, although she did not deliver remarks.
Atterbeary said her campaign will focus on growing the county’s affordable housing options, so that more families can afford to live in Howard, and bolstering the public school system. She’ll make her case partially during what could be her last session in the General Assembly.
“It’s going to be a lot of work,” she joked. “We’re going to do all the things. We’re going to raise money. We’ve only been in the race a short amount of time, and we’ve raised quite a bit of money. We’re going to be knocking on doors. We’re going to be going to all the events. I don’t think my social media has ever been this active.”
Conway makes it official in 7th District
Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway made it official Wednesday: He plans to challenge veteran U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume in next June’s Democratic primary for the 7th District seat in Congress.
Conway, who created a campaign fundraising committee earlier this month for a possible challenge, went to the Penn North neighborhood in Baltimore, which has been plagued by multiple opioid overdoses in recent months, for his announcement. He called for a new generation of leadership while acknowledging the uphill battle he faces against the well-known and much-admired Mfume.
“It’s not a small feat to challenge a popular incumbent,” Conway said in an interview. “But after a lot of soul-searching and sleepless nights, I decided to try to become the change I want to see.”

Conway said he has “an immense amount of respect” for the 76-year-old incumbent, and hailed Mfume’s 40-plus years of public service. But he said that with the Trump administration threatening U.S. democracy on a variety of fronts, “we are in a dramatically different world. Ronald Reagan is not president. It’s not the ’80s or ’90s or even the early 2000s. I think people are desperate for change.”
Mfume, who represented the Baltimore-based 7th District in the U.S. House from 1987 to 1996 and returned to Congress in 2020 after winning a special election, said in a statement to Maryland Matters that he is looking forward to continuing to work for his constituents.
“I am running for reelection and with God’s blessings I intend to win,” the congressman said. “I am a fighter for people, and this is one more fight to win.”
Mfume has a major head start on the fundraising front. Through Sept. 30, he had $705,736 in his campaign account, according to the latest campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Conway, 36, estimates he’ll need to raise at least $1 million to be competitive in the June 23 primary. But he does not plan to accept campaign donations from Baltimore Gas & Electric or its parent company, Exelon, or from AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobbying and political powerhouse.
Conway said he believes talking about issues like the high cost of energy and the Israel/Gaza conflict will help distinguish him from Mfume – and he has already returned contributions he received from BG&E for his council campaigns. He said he’ll also emphasize housing, health care, immigration and the opioid crisis on the campaign trail.
Several older Democratic members of the U.S. House are being pressured to retire from Congress or are facing primaries with aggressive young challengers. Three septuagenarian House Democrats died earlier this year. Just last week, 30-year-old Tennessee state Rep. Justin Pearson (D) announced he’d be taking on 76-year-old U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, the Volunteer State’s lone congressional Democrat, who is in his 10th term.
Conway does not have to sacrifice his council seat to run for Congress in 2026, sparking some speculation in Maryland political circles that he’s using this campaign to raise his profile for another race in 2028 or beyond. But the second-term councilmember insists he’s focused on the urgency of the current political moment.

“If I wait until 2028,” he said, “there may be no democracy left.”
So will it just be K?
Damian O’Doherty, a founding partner with Steve Kearney of KO Public Affairs, will leave the well-known public affairs firm after 17 years to launch his own firm, O’Doherty & Associates.
“In a time of momentous change, firms like KO are only growing in value. I’m deeply grateful to have worked with such smart and driven people — and to exit at the right time for my family,” O’Doherty said in a joint statement. “My global work in law, influence, and capital continues at O’Doherty & Associates LLC, helping leaders gain resonance in the AI epoch.”
The firm was founded in 2008 by Kearney and O’Doherty, who has been based out of Colorado for the last several years. Last year, the firm announced a merger with Sandy Hillman communications, adding consumer marketing to KO’s public affairs efforts, and in 2023, the firm added Josh White to its lobbying arm in Annapolis.
“We have built a tremendous firm over the last 18 years, working on some of the toughest issues in Maryland,” Kearney said in the statement. “While our work continues, we wish Damian the best in his new venture and are grateful for his contributions.

(Photo by Glenn Fawcett/Customs and Border Protection)Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport has joined major airports across the country that are declining to play a video in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown. 
“Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government,” Noem said in the video. “And because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA [Transportation Security Administration] employees are working without pay.”
The 30-second video recognizes the potential impacts the shutdown may have on travel, and concludes with Noem “hoping the Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
A BWI spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday that the airport does not plan to display the video because it does not “offer critical information related to travel for our passengers.” BWI communications director, Jonathan Dean’s statement also said that there is no requirement for the video to be shown. 
Agency shutdown messaging draws Hatch Act, Antideficiency Act challenges

The video is not playing at Salisbury Regional Airport, where Director Tony Rudy said Wednesday he was not aware of the video until someone mentioned it to him. But the airport was not asked to run the video, he said, and would not be able to run it even if asked, since he said they do not have the capabilities to show the video in their airport.
When asked if the video was running at Hagerstown Regional Airport, an employee who answered the phone said the airport had not comment.
Airports across the country have refused to play the video, according to published reports. Many say it violates local prohibitions on political advertising in public facilities, while others worry it is a clear violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan activity by federal workers when they’re on the clock or when using public equipment or facilities.
Noem’s video is not the first Trump administration action during the government shutdown that has raised Hatch Act concerns. With most of the government shut down because Congress could not agree on a budget, federal agencies have posted notices on their websites saying service and site updates may be delayes. But while some departments have simply cited a “lapse in funding,” others have blamed the shutdown on Democrats or, in some cases, “radical Left Democrats.”
The organization Public Citizen has filed a number of complaints with the government’s Office of Special Counsel over the “explicitly partisan messaging” by the departments that blame Democrats for the shutdown, calling the messages clear violations of the Hatch Act.
“The Trump administration is violating the Hatch Act with reckless abandon, using taxpayer dollars to plaster partisan screeds on every government homepage that they can get their hands on,” Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, said in a statement earlier this month.
Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) on Wednesday formally asked the Office of Special Counsel to investigate the Noem video for Hatch Act violations. Cantwell said the Department of Homeland Security “is using taxpayer dollars and federal assets to produce and air a video message featuring Secretary Noem, in her official capacity, making political attacks against Democratic Members of Congress.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The former director of the State Election Commission misrepresented a more than $30 million contract, worked with other staff members to falsify documents and lie about them, and misused funds for personal reasons, the commission chairman claimed Wednesday.
The commission voted 3-2 last month to fire then-Director Howard Knapp, followed soon after by the firing of his deputy director and the resignation of the agency spokesman, who Chairman Dennis Shedd claimed were in cahoots with the former director. At the time, Shedd said the decision came from a desire for different leadership.
Since Knapp’s termination, more information has come to light, Shedd said.
“This agency, we found out, has become a toxic and perhaps a hostile work environment under (Knapp’s) leadership,” Shedd said.
SC Election Commission fires executive director

Reached by the SC Daily Gazette, Knapp referred questions to his lawyer, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the lawyer for deputy director Paige Salonich.
Knapp and Solonich are under investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division for wiretapping, a spokeswoman said. SLED is also investigating Knapp, who led the agency since 2023, for unspecified misconduct in office.
The Office of the Inspector General is also looking into the agency’s work under Knapp’s leadership, Inspector General Brian Lamkin told the commission Wednesday.
Shedd declined to give more information on the falsified documents. Nor did he provide any more detail on Knapp’s alleged misuse of public dollars and equipment, though he suggested that was at least part of the SLED investigation.
After Knapp’s firing, the interim director was instructed to investigate two other employees: Salonich, who was also Knapp’s “very close friend,” and spokesman John Michael Catalano, Shedd said. He claimed Salonich and Catalano worked with Knapp to produce false records of conversations and lie about it.
Catalano told the SC Daily Gazette he resigned effective Friday but declined to say much else.
“I’m deeply grateful for my time there, but it was time for me to move on,” he said in a statement, adding that he’s not involved in any investigation by SLED or attorney general’s office.
Salonich was fired Sept. 22, following nearly a week of unpaid suspension, after raising her voice at agency leadership, using profanity, making disruptive remarks and placing an unauthorized device in a confidential meeting, according to her termination letter. Catalano resigned Friday, without giving a reason in his letter, which was provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
Salonich is suing the commission, claiming that someone working for the commission leaked intimate information about items found in her work desk to the press. The agency has not responded to the lawsuit, which was filed Sept. 30 in Richland County.
One of the commission’s five board members, Linda McCall, also resigned her post Sept. 22, saying she was not able to focus on the work because of personal conflicts, “as well as what went on with the ousting of the Director at our last meeting,” according to her resignation letter.
The letter did not elaborate as to what she meant, and she did not respond to a voicemail requesting comment.
None of the recent turmoil has any effect on the state’s elections, Shedd emphasized.
The most pressing issue facing the commission is an approximately $10 million bill for ballot scanners due Sept. 30 that the agency has yet to pay. Legislators included nearly $11 million in the state budget for the upgrades, about a third of the total price, but the agency won’t get that money until February, Shedd said.
One-time allocations approved in the budget are usually dispersed to agencies in the fall. But this year, the Legislature put in a directive to hold off until Feb. 20 just in case the economy went south and last year’s surplus would be needed to cover a shortfall. (As of this week’s revenue update for the first quarter, collections remain above expectations.)
SC elections agency faces ongoing legal challenges over voter rolls amid directors’ firings

Commissioners approved a contract last year to purchase more than 3,200 ballot scanners ahead of the presidential election. At the time, however, commissioners believed the commission would pay $28 million, that legislators had agreed to include the full amount in their spending plan for the year, and that anything not appropriated would be paid for by the state treasurer’s office, Shedd said.
That was not the case, Shedd said Wednesday.
When Knapp sent the final contract to the treasurer’s office, it was for $32 million. The treasurer signed the agency up for a program that provides low-cost financing to upgrade state agencies’ equipment, but the commission remains on the hook for paying it back, Treasurer Curtis Loftis told commissioners Wednesday.
Shedd didn’t know why the contract ended up being $4 million more than what commissioners anticipated, he said. When he asked the other three commissioners whether they recalled Knapp mentioning the increase in price, they all shook their heads.
The agency needs to come to some sort of agreement with the bank financing the loan before costly monthly penalties begin to mount, or before the bank moves to repossess the voting equipment, Loftis said.
“It sounds like a bigger problem than it is,” Loftis told the commission. “It’s just a mismatch.”
The bank is willing to move the due date back to February, but Shedd said he didn’t want his name on the agreement Knapp penned. The commission instructed interim director Jenny Wooten to come up with a solution with the bank that will allow the commission to postpone payments without signing the original contract.
The agency is asking legislators for $25 million to cover the remainder of the cost, plus any other costs that come up, in the coming state budget, Wooten said.
While the next fiscal year doesn’t start until July 1, 2026, the budget process begins with agencies sending in their requests this fall.
The firings were unrelated to an agreement in the works between the state and the Department of Justice to release voter information, Shedd said. Knapp and commissioners agreed the agency needed to do everything in its power to protect private voter information while also complying with the federal government, he said.
The agency is still waiting for a template of an agreement from the Department of Justice to continue discussions, Shedd said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4244-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 19:02:30.495899

Maybe not his truest feelings — that might be going a little bit too far. But Stephen, thank you for doing an incredible job. The people of this country love you.”Political crime and Caribbean boatsTrump again broached the possibility of defying two typical norms of presidential power: calling for prosecutions to retaliate against officials who’d investigated him and defending the extrajudicial strikes on alleged drug runners in the Caribbean Sea that he said could expand to land.Standing between Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump said U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, who, as a U.S. House Democrat before joining the Senate, led congressional investigations into Trump, and former prosecutor Jack Smith, who led criminal prosecutions, should be investigated.“Deranged Jack Smith is, in my opinion, a criminal,” Trump said. “I hope they’re looking at Shifty Schiff,” he added, referring to the California Democrat. “I hope they’re looking at political crime, because there’s never been as much political crime against a political opponent as what I had to go through.”Trump said the military's attacks on vessels suspected to be bringing drugs to the United States had effectively halted drug importation from Venezuela. The operation could expand to land targets, he said.“We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,” he said.",,,,2025-10-15 19:02:30.495899

Denise Garner, both members of the Arkansas Early Childhood Commission, listen to Republican Rep. Julie Mayberry during a work session to discuss child care funding on Oct. 15, 2025 in Little Rock. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ child care system needs additional funding to avoid widespread closures and layoffs due to changes to the state’s financial aid program for low-income families, providers told the state Early Childhood Commission during a Wednesday work session.
A survey of providers found that about a quarter of them, spread out among 50 of Arkansas’ 75 counties, expect 400 layoffs by November, said Shahid Sheikh, owner of four Northwest Arkansas child care centers. Sheikh was among several child care providers and experts invited to the commission’s work session for discussion.
Eighty of the 250 facilities who responded to the survey are likely to close in the next 60 days, and many of them are located in low-income communities where child care is already scarce, Sheikh said.
Sheikh and other child care providers have expressed concern in recent weeks about the Arkansas Department of Education’s proposed changes to the School Readiness Assistance Program. In September, the agency announced a new reimbursement structure and a sliding-scale copayment structure, with the goal of reducing the four-digit child care waitlist and making the program more financially sustainable.
Child care advocates said the changes would create barriers to access for families in need. The education department responded to the pushback by delaying cuts to providers’ reimbursement rates until Nov. 1, but moved forward with participant co-payments on Oct. 1 as planned, according to the Arkansas Democrat–Gazette.
Arkansas child advocates concerned about changes to school readiness program 

The reimbursement rate cuts are expected to cost providers statewide $727,000 per week, according to the survey. That adds up to $37.8 million in lost revenue for local economies, Sheikh told the commission Wednesday.
“We stand to lose more money by not investing in [child care] than we do by investing, so while this may be a budget problem right now, in a year’s time, it’s going to be a budget disaster for the state,” he said.
Education department officials are “going through our budget with a fine-toothed comb” in search of solutions, said Stacy Smith, deputy commissioner for the department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Families who are working or enrolled in school with income at or below the state poverty level will not pay a copayment for children before kindergarten, and families above the poverty level will pay a copay scaled to income and the age of the child, according to ADE.
Providers said their concerns about the copays being too expensive have come true.
“The amount that we’re asking families to pay is unreasonable for most of them, especially as such a quick ask,” said Jenny Castillo, who owns five Spanish language-immersion child care centers in Northwest Arkansas. “For it to be so fast, they have no time to prepare, to pivot.”
Castillo said she hopes the state finds a way to ensure that families pay no more than 7% of their household income for child care, a national recommendation.
The increased copayments as of Oct. 1 have already forced some Arkansas child care centers to close because parents could not afford to pay anymore, Sheikh said.
“We’ve already heard from some who have essentially [said], ‘It’s easier for me to quit my job and get on SNAP and have food stamps cover me than for me to go and work’” to try to afford child care, Sheikh said.










While this may be a budget problem right now, in a year’s time, it’s going to be a budget disaster for the state.

The School Readiness Assistance Program is funded by the federal Child Care and Development Fund. Education department officials are currently unable to seek help from the federal government regarding the program because of the ongoing government shutdown, Smith and Education Secretary Jacob Oliva both said.
The shutdown might force the department’s Office of Early Childhood to lay off federally-funded staff, Smith said.
State Reps. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, and Julie Mayberry, R-Hensley, were the only lawmakers present at the work session. The Legislature will meet in April for its regularly scheduled fiscal session, but child care providers said Wednesday that they can’t wait that long for financial aid.
Mayberry said she appreciated the input from the providers, particularly the data, and said a special legislative session might be necessary to address the problems presented. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is responsible for calling a special session, and Mayberry urged providers and the education department to involve Sanders’ office in discussions of next steps.
Garner, a member of the commission, said she hopes the discussion will soon create “action items.” 
“The things we need to know as legislators are what pots of money we actually have…how much money is that and where to pull money from the rest of the state budget and put it into early childhood [education],” Garner said.
The commission is scheduled to meet again at 10 a.m. Tuesday.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she is eager to replace New Hampshire Supreme Court Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi, who was convicted last week of criminal solicitation but is being allowed to remain a justice, in February.
“I really think this is something that needs to be addressed to the Department of Justice, to the attorney general,” Ayotte told reporters Wednesday. “But I will tell you that I am looking forward to February when I can replace her.”
Associate Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi
Hantz Marconi pleaded “no contest” — which means she isn’t openly admitting guilt but she is accepting conviction — on Oct. 7 in a Concord courtroom to charges related to a conversation with then-Gov. Chris Sununu about an investigation into her husband. Prosecutors accused her of attempting to wield her influence as a Supreme Court justice to convince Sununu to intervene in a criminal investigation into whether Geno Marconi, her husband and the state port authority director, had illegally shared confidential records. As part of a plea deal, Hantz Marconi was fined $1,200 and will not serve time in jail. Notably, she is being allowed to return to her position after a panel of judges convened to discuss the matter concluded she hadn’t committed a “serious crime.”
In February, Hantz Marconi will turn 70 and reach the mandatory retirement age for New Hampshire judges. At that point, Ayotte will have the opportunity to nominate her replacement. The justice was appointed and sworn in by Sununu in 2017.

Evers has written the Department of Energy urging officials not to cancel $1.5 billion in funds for Wisconsin projects. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)With more than $1.5 billion in federal energy investments in Wisconsin at risk, Gov. Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration not to roll back previously awarded funds in the face of rising energy costs.
Evers’ response, in a letter to U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, followed multiple news reports in the last week about energy projects on target lists for cancellation.
The governor’s office has compiled a list of 22 projects for which federal Energy Department funding totaling $1.56 billion has been marked for cancellation.
“Federal support plays a critical role in advancing the Wisconsin Idea and American innovation, lowering energy bills for families across America, supporting clean energy development to improve energy independence and resilience, creating good-paying jobs in innovative industries and sectors, and maintaining our nation’s leadership in science and technology,” Evers wrote Tuesday in his letter to Wright.  
“Given these clear benefits and the importance of these investments to Wisconsin’s and our nation’s economy, I was deeply concerned to see reporting last week containing a list of over 600 DOE funding awards that are potentially going to be targeted for termination with no clear reasoning or justification.”
Evers’ letter mentions several Wisconsin projects and companies on the target list, including several that the Wisconsin Examiner reported on this week.
The letter also notes forecasts of rising costs for electric power that the energy policy think tank Energy Innovation attributes to the tax and spending cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4.
“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless and ill-advised,” Evers concludes in his letter to Wright. “I urge you to reaffirm DOE’s commitment to honoring these funding awards and to continue supporting these investments that drive Wisconsin’s and the nation’s energy landscape forward.”

The world’s attention is focused on the Middle East this  week as a fragile ceasefire takes hold in Israel’s two-year long war in Gaza. Split-screen images show joyous reunions as Palestinians and Israelis who had been held captive greet their families, alongside scenes of shocking devastation in the Gaza Strip.
For Mohsen Mahdawi, this story is personal. In April, Mahdawi sat in a Vermont jail cell for more than two weeks fighting for his freedom. Mahdawi is a Palestinian-born student at Columbia University who was arrested by immigration agents at what he was told would be a citizenship interview in St. Albans. Mahdawi, 35, grew up in a refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank but is now a legal permanent resident living in Vermont. He is a practicing Buddhist, was president of the Columbia University Buddhist Association and co-founded Columbia’s Palestinian Student Union.
The Trump administration is trying to deport Mahdawi, claiming that his pro-Palestinian campus activism poses a threat to national security. Vermont federal Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Madahwi’s release on bail on April 30, comparing his arrest to the unlawful repression of free speech under McCarthyism. But the Trump administration appealed, arguing that Crawford did not have the right to intervene in Mahdawi’s detention. Madahwi vs. Trump was argued before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Sept. 30. Madahwi has a separate deportation case in immigration court that is ongoing.
“It’s not my case that is on trial,” Mahdawi said. “It is the constitution that is on trial. One of the most important and significant principles of democracy is the ability of expression and free speech. That’s the first amendment right in this country, and what we’ve seen through targeting me and other students and other even journalists is a direct violation of this principle that every American is so proud of and they hold very dearly.”
This legal drama has not slowed or silenced Madahwi. While out on bail this spring, Mahdawi graduated from Columbia University, receiving a standing ovation from his classmates as he walked across the stage to receive his diploma. This fall, he began a master’s degree at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs.
“I felt validated, that my efforts and the risk that I have taken is being honored and respected,” he said of the support from his Columbia classmates. “I felt that I’m not alone, and I felt a strong level of solidarity and that the community here made it very clear to the government and to those who have been targeting me that they are standing on the right side of history.”
Mahdawi was just named a 2025 Beerman Foundation Fellow for Peace and Justice for his work that “bridges faith, activism, and dialogue to advance nonviolence and dignity for all.”
Mahdawi is guardedly optimistic about the new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.  
“While there is a sense of relief and ability to say ‘I’m glad this is happening’, there is also still suspicion about how long this would last,” he said. 
“I pray that the war is over, but at the same time, I see that Israel now is saying that they have a historic right to the West Bank, which would prevent the creation of a Palestinian state, something that the majority of the world, more than 80% of the international community, the states, have recognized Palestine as a sovereign state, except America, and America has vetoed it,” Mahdawi said. “So I don’t say the war is over before giving Palestinians their rights — the right to self-determination, the right to freedom, the right of return and the right to live in dignity.”
The Vermont Conversation also spoke with Bernard Avishai, a visiting professor of government at Dartmouth College, and the author of four books including “The Tragedy of Zionism.” He writes regularly about Israeli politics for the New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Politico and other publications. He lives half the year in Israel.
“I do feel much more sense of hopefulness that both sides have learned what losses are entailed by this kind of war, and that it might be time to turn the page,” Avishai said. 
Avishai is a strong critic of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who he believes “is slowly converting (the) country from an open society to a closed and authoritarian one.”
“The real divide in Israel is between supporters of Greater Israel,” the nationalist movement intent on taking over Palestinian lands — “and supporters of global Israel,” or those who want to integrate Israel into the global economy.
Avishai believes that the Netanyahu government must go. “A change of government, a change of face to Israel, will at least begin the process of having Israel kind of rebuild relations with the Western world, but it’s a fundamentally dangerous economic situation for Israel to be on the one hand trying to build a global technological center, a hub in the global economy, and at the same time be alienating all the people they have to work with.”
Avishai said that Israeli media largely showed images of Israeli losses over the past two years, not Palestinian suffering. 
“It became tremendously numbing, and we have not, with all that numbing and self absorption and grief, really been able to focus on the cruelty and the difficulties we created in Gaza,” he said. “And I would like to believe that over the next five, six years, we will.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A group representing faculty at each of Iowa’s public universities is speaking out against the higher education compact developed by President Donald Trump and his administration and touted as a great opportunity by Iowa lawmakers.
The Iowa Higher Education Coalition sent a press release Wednesday in which it “rejects” calls from Rep. Taylor Collins and Sen. Lynn Evans for the Iowa Board of Regents to sign on to the Excellence in Higher Education Compact, which would have universities freeze tuition, limit international student enrollment and more.
Represented by the coalition are organizations including University of Northern Iowa faculty union United Faculty, Campaign to Organize Graduate Students at the University of Iowa, American Association of University Professors at the UI and Iowa State University and the Iowa Federation of Labor.
“The compact would subject our Iowa-operated public universities to extortion, based on demonstrating partisan loyalty to the federal government,” said United Faculty President Christopher Martin in the release. “Iowans would lose control of the universities. That’s a terrible deal for Iowa taxpayers.”

Universities would need to follow policies relating to admission and hiring, academic freedom, information on finances and institutional neutrality. Tuition would also freeze for five years. Those who do not enter into the compact possibly risk federal funding.
The compact’s vagueness on requiring a variety of viewpoints at all levels of campus community and use of language like “neutrality” and “excellence” is part of “an attempt to assert federal control over universities,” said United Faculty Vice President Fernando Calderón in the release.
Financial consequences of signing on to the compact could also be dire, the release stated, especially as state funding could remain flat in the upcoming fiscal year.
Tuition is the largest revenue source for Iowa universities and state funding makes up less than one-third of total revenues, and the release cited a Postsecondary Education & Economics Research Center paper that stated net costs for students and families have increased as a result of tuition freezes in other states.
The U.S. Department of Justice will be in charge of reviewing universities for compliance with the compact and will have those who have violated it forfeit federal funding and other “benefits” from the federal government for at least one year, according to the compact. The opponents’ release stated this would create even more financial uncertainty.
“The compact weaponizes public funding to compel ideological obedience. It transforms education from a public good into a conditional privilege granted only to institutions willing to align with state-sanctioned norms,” Calderón said in the release.
Protections for freedom of speech and “civil discourse in the classroom” are already set in place in Iowa Board of Regents policy and state code, the release stated, that provide guidance for how professors handle potentially controversial matters and ensure individuals can share their thoughts and ideas.
“We all want Iowa’s public universities to be places where students and faculty — regardless of political orientation — are not just free but encouraged to pursue their own intellectual discovery and to contribute to a campus culture devoted to excellence, curiosity and tolerance,” said Cullen Padgett-Walsh, president of Iowa State University’s AAUP chapter, in the release. “Bullying from the federal government isn’t the way to get there.”

Ed Markey will face a challenge from a younger Democrat in the state’s Congressional delegation.
Congressman Seth Moulton of Salem announced Wednesday morning that he will run for U.S. Senate next year, arguing that Massachusetts cannot wait another six years to install someone from a younger generation in the Senate. The Democrat has not been shy about challenging members of his own party — he won his seat in the U.S. House in 2014 by defeating longtime Democratic Congressman John Tierney, briefly challenged U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi for the speaker’s gavel in 2018 and joined a crowded field for president in 2019.
“Our party has clung to the status quo, insisted on using the same old playbook, and isn’t fighting hard enough. The next generation will keep paying the cost if we don’t change course. This isn’t a fight we can put off for another six years. The future we all believe in is on the line,” Moulton said in his introduction video.
The 46-year-old (turns 47 this month) adds, “We’re in a crisis, and with everything we learned last election, I just don’t believe Senator Markey should be running for another six-year term at 80 years old, even more, I don’t think someone who’s been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future.”
Democrats limped out of the 2024 national elections without control of the White House or either branch of Congress, and President Donald Trump returned to office having improved his standing with some voters.
Moulton made waves early in his party’s self-reflection period with comments about transgender athletes, telling the New York Times that Democrats “spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face.”
Gov. Maura Healey and other Massachusetts Democrats publicly spoke against Moulton’s commentary on transgender athletes. His comments also started a push to challenge Moulton in the 2026 primary, and his announcement will mean an open contest for the 6th Congressional District U.S. House seat north of Boston.
In his announcement, Moulton’s campaign said he is focused on “affordability, health care, climate change, banning assault weapons and protecting our democracy.” His announcement cites his authorship of “the most ambitious high-speed rail plan in decades” and his work to launch a bipartisan 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
Markey, 79, often cites the “age of your ideas” as most critical and has steadily rolled out endorsements from scores of federal, state and local elected officials as he has made his case for reelection. In the last week alone, he has announced the backing of the Mass. Nurses Association, League of Conservation Voters Action Fund, five state senators and more than a dozen state representatives from Greater Boston and a handful of mayors. House Speaker Ronald Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka endorsed Markey in September.
Moulton completed four combat tours in Iraq as an infantry officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. In Salem, he co-founded and was president of Eastern Healthcare Partners.
In a recent poll by Advantage, Inc. for the Fiscal Alliance Foundation, Moulton was ahead of Markey 43 percent to 21 percent among all likely general election voters, with 36 percent undecided. Among likely Democratic primary voters, Moulton was chosen by 38 percent to Markey’s 30 percent.
In 2020, when Markey faced a primary challenge from then-Congressman Joseph Kennedy III, the Malden Democrat took 55 percent of the primary vote to Kennedy’s 45 percent. Markey  won reelection by defeating Republican Kevin O’Connor.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/48714536903_4f4cca6f55_k.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

The decision left open the possibility that the General Assembly could take away appointments by the governor and award them to other members of the Council of State, including those of the opposing party. They upheld the restructuring of four other boards, such as the Building Code Council and Environmental Management Commission, where the Council of State as a whole retained majority control, even where the governor could not appoint a majority.
The appeals court partially overturned a 2024 ruling by a Wake Superior Court panel, which had held that only the Board of Transportation and Economic Investment Committee restructurings violated the separation of powers. That ruling had been challenged both by the governor’s office and legislative leaders, who sought that all changes be ruled unconstitutional or constitutional, respectively.
The laws in question — Senate Bill 512 and House Bill 488, passed in August 2023 — cut the number of gubernatorial appointees on several state boards and commissions and expanded appointments by legislative leaders and Republicans on the Council of State. The BOT, for example, was changed from a body of 20 appointees by the governor to one made up of 14 legislative appointees and six gubernatorial appointees.
The Court of Appeals found that the Superior Court erred in allowing the restructuring of the Commission for Public Health as it stripped the governor of the ability to appoint a majority of the board — the General Assembly claimed four of the original nine gubernatorial appointees for itself, while four others are appointed by the North Carolina Medical Society.
“The General Assembly has ‘prevent[ed] another branch from performing its constitutional duties,’” Judge Jeffery Carpenter wrote in the decision. “The executive branch cannot take care that the laws be faithfully executed as there is no guarantee that the members from the North Carolina Medical Society will support the Governor’s policy preferences.”
The panel — made up of Carpenter, Judge John Tyson, and Judge Tom Murry, all of whom are Republicans — upheld the lower court’s ruling that the changes to the EMC, Coastal Resources Commission, and Wildlife Resources Commission are permissible. 
“While the Governor does not directly appoint a majority of each commission’s members, the executive branch holds majority-appointment power,” Carpenter wrote. “The Commissioner of Agriculture and Commissioner of Insurance, both members of the Council of State, along with the Governor combine to grant the executive branch majority-appointment power concerning the EMC, CRC, and WRC.”

Both seats on the Council of State are held by Republicans — with Steve Troxler serving as agriculture commissioner since 2005 and Mike Causey serving as insurance commissioner since 2017 — meaning Republicans hold a majority of appointments on the three boards between the Council of State and the legislature.
The Court of Appeals also sided with the General Assembly on H.B. 488’s changes to the Building Code Council, transferring many of its functions to a new Residential Code Council, as a majority of the new body’s members are still appointed by the governor.
In a concurring opinion, Murry noted that unlike the federal government, North Carolina’s state constitution has historically given the legislature greater authority than the other two branches of government — not granting the governor veto power until the 1990s — and divides executive power among several elected members of the Council of State.
“The majority correctly upholds the constitutionality of restructuring the WRC, EMC, and CRC into the Agriculture and Insurance Commissioners’ portfolios because doing so preserves the power of the Executive Branch relative to the Legislative,” Murry wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NC-Court-of-Appeals-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

(Timisu graphic via Pixabay)Saying that this week alone an individual has called more 35 times making threats to the Florida Commission on Ethics, the chairman of that state agency is requesting that lawmakers provide a public records exemption for the personal information and addresses of the staff and commissioners during the 2026 legislative session.
Jon Philipson, appointed by Gov. DeSantis to chair the commission in July, made that request while addressing the members of the Senate Committee on Ethics and Elections Wednesday afternoon.
“In this time where we’re having more political violence, more strife, the Commission on Ethics, an independent agency that serves to ensure that our Constitution is followed when it comes to ethics, is constantly under attack,” Philipson said.
He added that those attacks include a previous executive director of the commission being threatened at their personal home address after the panel denied an individual’s complaint — while that individual was exiting prison.
“The threats are real,” he said.
Another factor is that commissioners must now complete a Form 6 financial disclosure, which Philipson said was “more invasive and more expansive” than a previous version. Public officials are required to reveal their entire net worth, including the dollar amounts of bank accounts, 401(k) plans. and other assets.
Philipson had three other asks of the Legislature for the 2026 session.

Expanded protections for public employees and contractors from retaliation when they report ethics violations, including the misuse of public money, conflicts of interest, and abuses of authority. A bill (SB 92) has already been filed in the Senate by Ethics and Elections Chairman Don Gaetz, R-Seaside, and in the House (HB 139) by Patt Maney, R-Okaloosa County.
Expand the definition of “family” with regards to the disclosure of gifts. Currently, lawmakers do not need to disclose a gift worth more than $100 if it comes from a family member, which can include fiancés and roommates. The proposal would expand the definition to cover foster children and foster parents.
A waiver on fines to late filers of financial disclosure forms. Currently, fines begin at $25 a day, up to $1,500. Individuals who hit that $1,500 fine would not be eligible for that exemption. Philipson said that the commission has had “success” with a similar law providing waivers for lobbyists who file compensation reports late. “We’ve seen a low level of recidivism for that one-time waiver,” he said.

The first day of the regular legislative session takes place on Jan. 13.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of North Dakota lawmakers will decide next week whether to endorse four bill drafts that could help the state get more money from a sweeping federal rural health care grant.
Congress created the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program this summer as part of its 10-year budget reconciliation law. The program was advertised as a way to support rural states in light of cuts to Medicaid in the bill.
The grant money is intended to go toward areas like behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development and disease prevention.
North Dakota by Nov. 5 must submit an application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that includes a detailed plan for how it will use its share of the funding.
North Dakota taking steps to ban candy, soda purchases with SNAP benefits

Every state will get at least $500 million, though the federal government has identified ways states can get additional funds — including by adopting certain health policies.
A 33-member committee met this week to help the state prepare its application.
On Wednesday, the committee asked Legislative Council to draft four bills to implement some of the policies singled out as favorable by the federal government.
The Department of Health and Human Services told lawmakers at the meeting that the state could get more funding by including the bill drafts in their application, which would signal to the federal government that the Legislature intends to adopt the policies. 
The policies would require schools to participate in a federal fitness test, make doctors receive ongoing nutrition education, have North Dakota join a physician assistant licensure compact and to expand what kinds of services pharmacists are legally allowed to provide.
The committee will weigh the merits of the bill drafts when it reconvenes next Tuesday. Committee members will vote on whether to forward the legislation for consideration by the full Legislature, which is expected to hold a special session in January or February.
The first bill draft would make schools in North Dakota conduct the Presidential Fitness Test. The test was retired by President Barack Obama in 2012, but Trump revived it in a July executive order. 
The federal government has not yet announced what would be required under the new Presidential Fitness Test, but in 2012 it included a mile run, a sit-up test, a sitting flexibility test, a shuttle run and a push-up or pull-up test.
Another proposal the committee will consider next week is to require doctors to have continuing education on nutrition.
Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers that the federal government is incentivizing this policy based on research that shows doctors often lack sufficient nutrition education. 
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, was the only lawmaker to vote against drafting the bill Wednesday.
“It seems like a person that’s gone to medical school would have had plenty of training in nutrition,” he said.
The third bill draft that the committee will vote on next week is a proposal to have North Dakota join a multi-state physician assistant licensure compact.
The idea is to make it easier for North Dakota physician assistants to practice in other states.
A bill to have North Dakota join the licensure compact was considered during the 2025 legislative session, though it died in the Senate. 
North Dakota lawmakers build wish list for $500M federal rural health care grant

The last bill draft would give pharmacists more authority to conduct laboratory tests and issue prescriptions.
North Dakota Pharmacists Association Executive Vice President Mike Schwab told lawmakers that this policy could improve access to health care in rural areas of the state that don’t have full-time medical clinics.
“I can think of a few communities where the clinic’s only open a couple days — outside of that they have to travel 30 to 50 miles to the nearest clinic,” Schwab said.
The Rural Health Transformation Program created incentives for some policies that the committee declined to take up. 
One of them would have involved lifting the state’s nursing home bed moratorium.
The Legislature adopted the moratorium in 1995 and most recently renewed it during the 2025 legislative session.
The reason for the moratorium is partly to prevent the number of beds across the state from growing to an extent that could threaten the financial stability of rural providers, including by diluting federal subsidies.
“I’ve always believed that the moratorium helps keep beds in rural areas, and by opening this up we could do damage to that situation,” said Rep. Kathy Frelich, R-Devils Lake.
Supporters also argue the moratorium helps promote senior care alternatives most aging Americans prefer, like home health services.
Opponents of the moratorium during the session criticized it as overregulation.

The committee on Wednesday decided against taking another look at the moratorium after some lawmakers expressed that reviving the debate was unlikely to be productive.
“This discussion would take us weeks,” Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said during the meeting.
The committee also decided against drafting bills that would expand services that dental hygienists could provide, and creating a license and registration process for telehealth providers.
The Rural Health Transformation Committee will reconvene Tuesday at 12:30 p.m.

Another two criticisms and two positive comments were offered verbally Wednesday during a hearing in Aberdeen conducted by the state Board of Education.
In response, department officials said they will amend the proposal. 
The proposed standards were reviewed by a 20-person revision committee after being developed by a statewide advisory group. South Dakota Secretary of Education Joe Graves said the proposal leaves core concepts largely unchanged but describes them more clearly and concisely.
“The department aimed to make them more accessible and understandable for educators, students and families alike,” Graves said.

Others disagreed with that characterization. Sharon Vestal, a math professor at South Dakota State University, said she was concerned the simplification has “taken out some of the precise mathematics and the meaning behind it.” 
Oldham-Ramona math teacher Susan Gilkerson said she is “on the fence” regarding the changes. She worries the new standards “took the meat off the bones” and will not give educators a clear understanding of just how deeply they need to teach a subject to ensure they meet the new standards.
The proposal pulls from other states’ standards across the nation, and from the Archimedes standards, which were written by an assistant professor at Hillsdale College. The Michigan-based private college was also involved in South Dakota’s revised social studies standards, accepted in 2023 and implemented this school year.
State board approves controversial social studies standards on 5-2 vote

One of the states from which the proposed math standards are drawn is Arkansas, which has historically had lower test scores than South Dakota. Graves said Arkansas went through a similar process to simplify and improve its math standards a few years ago.
“The results of that change haven’t appeared. We don’t know what that’s going to result in,” Graves said.
Graves added that South Dakota students “lack significant progress” on math testing since the COVID-19 pandemic, which he attributed to the current standards. About 44% of students were proficient or above on the state test annually over the last five years, he said. 
Vestal told board members the scores are a result of disruptions students suffered during the pandemic.
“A lot was lost that year when they went online, and we’re still trying to gain that back,” Vestal said. “That has been a huge problem, and we haven’t recovered.”
The U.S. Education Department awarded South Dakota a five-year, $3.7 million grant to support implementation of new standards, provide professional development for elementary school educators, facilitate higher education collaboration, and allow school district math leaders to meet and develop math plans. 
Graves said the department will take the critiques raised in the public comments, “figure out what to do, and be back in November with ideas on those.” The next meeting will be Nov. 10 in Sioux Falls.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Social-Studies-Testimony-scaled-e1760565193320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)I wish I could blame congressional Republicans or congressional Democrats for the government shutdown, now in its third week.
I wish I could hold decades of New Hampshire lawmakers, on the left and right, responsible for a system that has consistently punished school districts, and consequently the children they serve, for the sin of being poor.
I wish I could point the finger at the Trump administration for the appalling way this country treats women, immigrants, people with mental illness, Black people, Native Americans, people with disabilities, trans people, young people, old people, working people.
But I can’t, because this is what we built together. You and I. Us.
And we should have seen it coming — this moment right now — a long time ago, whenever it was that we made politics a central form of entertainment. From that very first day that we started seeing ourselves as political spectators with rooting interests — Go Red! Go Blue! — rather than the employers of our public servants, we should have known. When the Donalds, and Hillaries, and Kamalas, and Bernies became celebrities rather than people asking us for a job, that should have been the brightest of red flags. 
And we should have understood, when modernity handed each of us our own printing press, radio station, and movie camera, that truth would lose currency in the swell and din. 
We should have expected, through the rudeness with which we treat the people who serve our coffee, the allegations we hurl at those who teach our children and treat our illnesses, and the way we belittle and dismiss those who dare disagree with us on social media, that a government created in our own image would find it so easy to blame, to hate, to inflict harm.
We should have known that our ever-dimming enlightenment would open the door to the most strident champions of our basest instincts — from President Donald Trump, to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, to N.H. House Majority Leader Jason Osborne — who seek not to do good broadly but to punish strategically.
If you listen, really listen, to politicians like that, it should be clear enough that they are not invested in people or their problems. When Osborne talks about the Claremont School District’s financial issues, for example, there is no concern for the kids who are most affected. There is only calculation — what can be seized politically to advance an ideology to which the people of New Hampshire are incidental rather than fundamental? 
And we should have known that this rise of the far right would also recalibrate the center, creating a place where New Hampshire’s two Democratic U.S. senators felt comfortable voting to confirm a billionaire, Scott Bessent, for treasury secretary and another Cabinet member who just this week suggested that peaceful protesters are domestic terrorists. The state’s two U.S. representatives, also inhabitants of the new center, have similarly taken “go along to get along” positions, most notably with their support of the unconstitutional, anti-immigrant Laken Riley Act.
Democrats hate that kind of criticism. They call it “false equivalency” because their position is that the scope of what Republicans are doing is far worse. While they’re right about that second part, they’re wrong about the first. Every public servant should be held to a higher standard than the baseline idiocy and cruelty of their opposition. That’s one of the ways we’ll get out of this mess — if we can get out of this mess.
But first, we the people need to rediscover both our goodness and our authority.
I hope those who are inclined to support this gang of Republicans, at least those who aren’t just in it for the racism and misogyny, spend a little less time cheering for the libs to get owned and start asking better questions about who really stands to gain from Trump’s economic manipulations (most notably what the Trump family stands to gain), from crypto to tariffs to the gutting of the IRS to those rich-guy tax cuts. I hope they ask tougher questions, too, of the Republicans in the New Hampshire State House who seem more interested in mimicking the Trump administration’s lies and barbarity than addressing real state-level challenges.
And I hope those who tend to vote Democratic will interrupt their candidates when they go on for too long about what and whom they’re against to ask more about what it is they’re actually for. It doesn’t take much political bravery to go after America’s 1,135 billionaires or roughly 10,000 centi-millionaires on principle, so what does a policy outline toward more economic fairness look like? In this Wild West era of campaign finance, what financial enemies are Democratic candidates actually willing to make? And, in New Hampshire, do the state party’s chosen candidates have the courage to run on what’s right for the people rather than just what’s considered politically safe in the land of The Pledge?

The town of Shelburne has terminated a police sergeant who pleaded guilty last month to a criminal misdemeanor charge of driving his cruiser while on duty and striking and killing a cyclist.
The town’s selectboard held a personnel hearing in closed session Tuesday night and then issued a statement that read, “Kyle Kapitanski is no longer employed by the Town of Shelburne.” 
The selectboard, the statement added, would not be releasing its written decision in the matter, contending it is exempt from disclosure under the law a “personal” document. 
The statement did not specify what policies or procedures Kapitanski may have violated leading to his termination. 
Kapitanski entered a plea agreement in September that allowed him to avoid jail time for his role in the November crash that killed 38-year-old Sean Hayes of Burlington. 
Kapitanski had been on paid leave by the town since the crash, pending an internal investigation.
He was initially charged with a felony offense of gross negligent operation of a motor vehicle with death resulting. That charge was reduced to a misdemeanor offense of negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a fatality as part of the plea deal he entered into with prosecutors.

As part of that agreement, Kapitanski was sentenced to six to 12 months in jail, all suspended, and he was placed on probation for two years. 
Kapitanski was driving his cruiser 40 to 45 mph in a 35-mph zone on Shelburne Road in South Burlington when the early morning crash took place, prosecutors said during September’s hearing in criminal court in Burlington. 
Hayes, court records stated, appeared to be adjusting his bicycle and a trailer attached to it before he started walking southbound with the bicycle when Kapitanski’s cruiser struck him.
Leading up to the crash, a charging affidavit stated, Kapitanski had YouTube videos playing on a computer tablet mounted in his cruiser. A link to the last video was provided in the filing and it was titled, “Trans woman CONFRONTING Matt Walsh takes UNEXPECTED turn,” the affidavit stated. 
David Sleigh, Kapitanski’s attorney in the criminal case, contended there was no proof his client was distracted while driving by videos. 
The prosecutor in the case said at the hearing that Kapitanski’s possible return to his job in law enforcement has “effectively” been prevented.  
Shelburne Town Manager Matt Lawless, in an email to reporters Tuesday night, wrote that the executive session held by the selectboard was warned under a provision in the law to consider  “disciplinary or dismissal action against a public officer or employee.”
Lawless added that town officials would not be providing additional records or details related to Kapitanski’s termination. 
“The trial documents establish the facts of the case, so I’ll leave it at that,” he wrote.
Kapitanski could not be reached for comment. 
Hayes’ estate has also brought a civil lawsuit that remains pending against the town of Shelburne in connection with the fatal crash.

The number of measles cases statewide reported so far this year rose to 16 this week, the highest number since the disease was eradicated more than two decades ago.
All 16 people were unvaccinated, and none had immunity from a previous infection, according to the state Department of Public Health.
Health officials are now warning unvaccinated patrons of a Greenville gym, which offers day care for customers, that they may have been exposed.
The health agency reported a confirmed case in a Greenville County child last week. Bell said officials don’t know how the child contracted the disease and the child might have spread the virus to others.
“We don’t want anyone to have a false sense of security,” Bell said. “We want people to be aware that we have evidence of transmission in the community. So, exposures can be unexpected, can be unpredicted.”
150 Spartanburg County students quarantined as measles continues to spread in SC

Officials urged the parents of any unvaccinated children at the Crunch Fitness’ location at 1332 S. Pleasantburg Drive in Greenville between 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sept. 30 to see their health care provider.
“This is an ongoing investigation and that facility is working with us to provide the names of the children who may have been dropped off at that facility during the timeframe,” Bell added. “We have not yet confirmed the vaccination status of the (other) children who were there at the same time.”
A dozen of the other cases to date are directly linked to an outbreak centered around two Spartanburg County schools: Fairforest Elementary School, which is part of Spartanburg School District 6, and Global Academy, a public charter school, department officials said.
The five newest diagnosed cases are among the 139 students of those two schools who remain quarantined at home after being exposed to the virus, meaning it is less likely those children have spread the virus to others.
South Carolina requires all children enrolled in school, both public and private, to be up to date on vaccinations, though there are exemptions granted for religious or medical reasons.
Spartanburg County, the center of the outbreak, has one of the lowest vaccination rates among school children in the state, according to health department data.
More than 8% of Spartanburg County’s 58,000 students received a religious exemption during the 2024-2025 school year, by far the most of any county in the state.
“Another concern in particular about this low coverage in the school districts in the Upstate is that they are also have among the highest enrollment in the state,” Bell said.
About the disease
Measles symptoms usually start with a fever, cough, red eyes and runny nose, followed by a rash that typically begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. The rash can last up to a week.
Severe cases of the virus can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children, according to the public health department.
The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after a sick person passes through a room, making it possible to get sick without directly interacting with an infected person. Those exposed are expected to stay home for 21 days, which is how long the virus can stay in a person’s body before they realize they’re sick, Bell said.
The two-dose vaccine has been in use for decades and provides lifelong immunity to nearly all who receive it. Side effects, including soreness or an allergic reaction at the injection site, are possible.
“But what we want people to pay careful attention to is that the complications from the disease itself far outweigh any rare adverse events that might be associated with the vaccine,” Bell said.
Up to 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to the measles will get the virus, she said.

The section prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate based on race.Protesters rally at the U.S. Capitol and in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025, as justices heard a case from Louisiana challenging the Voting Rights Act. (Video by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, a Louisiana Democrat and member of the caucus, cautioned his state could lose two majority Black congressional districts if the court strikes down the section in question.“Critics claim that the VRA is no longer needed, but history and data tells quite a different story,” Carter said.“Though Black people make up one-third of the population (in the state), only five (Black) Louisianians have served in the U.S. House out of 171. That's not equal representation. That's a travesty. Without protections like Section 2, Black communities will lose power. Their concerns are sidelined, and our democracy is weakened.”

U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, a Democrat of Alabama, said she sat through the more than two hours of oral arguments in the Supreme Court Wednesday morning into afternoon.“What was clear in the questioning of the majority on the court is that they have something in mind,” Sewell said, adding that she believes the conservative majority wants to “claw back Section 2, if not to eliminate it totally.”

Two years ago, the justices affirmed Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, finding that an Alabama congressional district map likely violated it. “This case is more than just about congressional maps. It's about who we are as a nation and what we want our democracy to be. Now, I may be the first Black congresswoman from Alabama, but I damn sure won’t be the last,” Sewell said.Earlier Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the Supreme Court before and during oral arguments. Nearly two dozen advocacy groups organized the rally, dubbed “Fight for Fair Maps.” Speakers included leaders from the NAACP, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, The Urban League and the National Council of Negro Women.

They want to take away anything that feels real about our ability to have these rights,” Graves said.Many in the crowd held signs featuring the face of the late civil rights leader and Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis next to the words “Protect Our Vote.”

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A longtime South Dakota state employee from Spearfish was indicted this week in Lawrence County for allegedly falsifying child abuse reports.
Attorney General Marty Jackley, who announced the charges against 56-year-old Nova J. Collins in a Wednesday press release, said the charges were the first to be filed under a new state law that requires all state employees to disclose suspected “improper conduct” by their coworkers.
The legislation came in response to a crush of state employee criminal cases in 2024 across multiple state agencies. The most costly to taxpayers involved the misappropriation of $1.78 million by a former Department of Social Services employee.
Former state employee sentenced to seven years in prison for stealing $1.8 million

The press release on Collins’ indictment says the charges are related to “falsifying reports related to a child abuse investigation,” but does not include further details on the alleged behavior.
Tony Mangan, spokesman for Jackley, said he could confirm that Collins was reported by a “fellow state employee.” Mangan said he couldn’t offer more details during an ongoing investigation.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Collins referred to herself as a supervisor with the state of South Dakota on her LinkedIn profile. It says she’s worked for the state for 25 years. Jackley’s press release referred to Collins as a “former state employee.”
Collins’ indictment lists four felony charges related to forgery and falsified evidence, as well as a misdemeanor charge for falsification of public records by a public officer or employee. If convicted on all counts, she could be incarcerated for up to 15 years.
According to the indictment, each charge relates to Collins’ alleged falsification of a document called a DSS Initial Family Assessment and Child Safety Determination report for a minor child, identified only by initials, between January and June of this year.
Such a document is completed by a Department of Social Services employee following a report of abuse and neglect, according to the department website. 
The indictment provides no further details, and it’s so far the only public court document filed in the case.

Wyoming ranch owner Eshelman says justices should review his failed lawsuit because lower court's ruling carries ""profound"" legal consequences.
The post Corner-crossing petition to Supreme Court employs successful past strategies appeared first on WyoFile .","As Supreme Court justices meet Friday to consider hearing the Wyoming corner-crossing case, attorneys for ranch owner Fred Eshelman are citing reasons that others have successfully employed to get their cases accepted for review.
The Supreme Court should accept Eshelman’s petition and hear the case because, his attorneys say, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision on corner crossing “contravenes” Supreme Court precedent. The case also has “profound legal and practical importance,” Eshelman argues.
Eshelman is appealing the 10th Circuit Court’s decision that he cannot block the public from corner crossing to reach public land surrounded by his Carbon County ranch. He sued four Missouri hunters who stepped from one piece of public property to another adjacent one where the two met at a checkerboard corner with two parcels of Eshelman’s Elk Mountain Ranch. The hunters did not touch the ranch owner’s land.
Eshelman, through his ranch-owning company Iron Bar Holdings, maintains the hunters trespassed when they passed through the airspace above his property, a violation of Wyoming law. In seeking a Supreme Court hearing, Eshelman’s attorneys use two of the most successful approaches, expert Dan Schweitzer wrote in a guide, that petitioners have employed to convince the court to hear their cases.
“This petition does not meet this Court’s criteria for granting review.” Ryan Semerad
Eshelman’s petition, however, is not based on the first reason the court lists for taking up petitions for a writ of certiorari, or review. That’s when there are conflicting decisions on the same matter between two of the 13 federal circuit courts of appeal.
That’s fodder for the hunters who say they don’t want the court to consider the case, but are willing to fight if it does.
“This petition does not meet this Court’s criteria for granting review,” one of the hunters’ attorneys, Ryan Semerad, wrote in a Supreme Court filing. “Iron Bar doesn’t claim that the decision below implicates a circuit split.”
Because the 10th Circuit Court is the only one to address corner crossing, “No split exists,” the hunters contend.
Only 5% of petitions succeed
The 10th Circuit agreed with the hunters that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act prevents Eshelman from blocking corner crossers. Based on the 10th Circuit’s decision in March, corner crossing to reach isolated tracts of federal public land is now legal in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma.
Corner crossing arises from the public’s desire to reach its own public land in the checkerboard area of Wyoming. The checkerboard pattern of alternating square mile ownership overlays Eshelman’s wildlife-rich, 20,000-acre-plus Elk Mountain Ranch.
By preventing corner-crossing, Eshelman, a hunter himself, reaps for himself the bounty of public property — property owned by all Americans — critics contend.
Obtaining a review of federal appeals court decisions is rare. In 2024, the Supreme Court agreed to hear 5.2% of 1,344 petitions (not counting petitions from indigent appellants, of which there are many), according to an analysis that Empirical SCOTUS writer Adam Feldman published on SCOTUSblog.
Eshelman’s attorneys explain their reasoning that the appeal should be among those rare cases the court considers. They are second- and third-tier reasons, according to Schweitzer’s 2019 guide — lower court decisions that “directly conflict[s] with Supreme Court precedent” and issues that are “extremely important.”

Iron Bar claims the 10th Circuit Court contravened the Supreme Court’s own 1979 decision known as Leo Sheep. (Leo is a rural Carbon County settlement; Leo Sheep was a company named after the place.) In that case, the court ruled that the government did not have an implied easement to build a road across a common checkerboard corner to reach a reservoir used for recreation.
But Leo Sheep doesn’t apply to the Iron Bar case, the hunters, and the 10th Circuit, contend. Among other things, Leo Sheep dealt with a road constructed on private land, and there also was another way to reach the reservoir.
The 10th Circuit’s decision, written by Judge Timothy Tymkovich and agreed to by two other appellate judges, said that “the Supreme Court can also reconsider the scope of Leo Sheep, as it applies to this case.”
Profoundly important
Attorneys who write successful petitions also argue that their issue is an important one and, as Schweitzer puts it, their pleadings therefore “dive into the merits to a far greater degree.” Schweitzer writes that decisions that impair government officials from doing their jobs or that create a devastating impact on an industry can qualify for review.
“If a 140-year-old fence statute can be read to extinguish [state trespass laws] then no realm of traditional state property law is secure,” Eshelman’s attorneys wrote. The 10th Circuit, if its decision stands, creates “uncertainty for millions of landowners, recreationalists, and law enforcement officials across millions of acres of land.”
Stockmen warn that “unrestrained public access … can cause great stress to livestock,” Eshelman’s filings state. Further, the 10th Circuit’s “sweeping” decision affecting property rights across millions of acres is “an important question of federal law,” that the Supreme Court should address.
Hunters say Eshelman has done an about-face.
When resisting the hunters’ request to move the case from state to federal court, Eshelman and Iron Bar “denied that this case implicates ‘an important question of federal law,’” the hunters state. Instead, the ranch owner described any federal issues as “not substantial.”
Eshelman argued in Wyoming’s civil court that the case concerned “only two sections” of his property and that the controversy involved “well under $75,000,” in value, a hunters’ brief states. Eshelman argued unsuccessfully in 2022 that those limited impacts should allow the ranch owner to pursue his suit in the state court system and not the federal one.
The hunters, however, convinced a federal judge to move the case to the federal court system. “Only after losing [his effort to keep the case in Wyoming courts] did Iron Bar revise its estimated damages from the hunters’ momentary incursions on its airspace upwards to $8 million,” the hunters’ attorneys wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court. Now Eshelman contends the impact is “billions,” they wrote.
Eshelman could benefit from amicus briefs filed to support his petition, SCOTUSblog’s analysis of the last eight years of petitions shows. The United Property Owners of Montana, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the Wyoming Wool Growers Association, the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence and Montana Stockgrowers Association’s amicus filings boost Eshelman’s chances of obtaining a writ because they indicate a “national stake.”
The hunters’ attorneys, however, chose neither to enlist an “elite” and practiced Supreme Court lawyer nor ask for briefs from groups that support their public-access case. Doing either could have signaled to the Supreme Court that the case is indeed nationally significant, contrary to the hunters’ position that the 10th Circuit appropriately took care of all necessary business.
The Supreme Court’s hearing on Friday will be held behind closed doors. Within several days, the court is expected to publish a list of cases that it will accept for review.

(Photo credit: Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s Republican-controlled House, undeterred by Gov. Ron DeSantis’s veto earlier this year of identical legislation, is pushing ahead again with an effort to broaden the class of people who can bring wrongful death lawsuits against physicians.
“If you’re feeling a little déjà vu today it’s because you should be feeling a little déjà vu. We heard this exact bill in this committee,” Fort Pierce Republican and HB 6003 bill sponsor Rep. Dana Trabulsy said Wednesday.
The GOP legislator made her comments before a House panel voted overwhelmingly for the bill that allows parents of single, childless, adult children to sue for noneconomic damages such as pain and suffering arising from alleged medical malpractice.
Florida also bans adults (defined as 25 and older) from pursuing wrongful death claims for single parents who die from medical malpractice, and the bill would remove that ban, too. The Legislature adopted the bans during the 1990s as the state wrestled with rising malpractice premiums but Florida remains one of the few states to have such restrictions in place.
HB 6003 cleared the House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee with two dissenting votes, although some representatives hinted that their continued support would hinge on changes, including caps on noneconomic damages that could be recovered in all medical malpractice lawsuits.
“While I vote up on this bill today, I am hopeful that in the future, either in this chamber or the next, that reasonable limits will somehow find their way into this bill, thereby achieving the balance and allowing us to achieve justice without inadvertently creating another injustice to replace that one,” said Jacksonville Republican Rep. Dean Black.

HB 6003 reignites a long-standing fight between trial attorneys, organized medicine, and insurance companies over Florida’s medical malpractice laws and the amount of noneconomic damages plaintiffs can recover.
Florida has not had caps on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits since 2014, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled that they are unconstitutional. But the makeup of the court has changed since then, with the majority of the justices having been appointed by DeSantis.
The insurance and business communities see HB 6003 as a vehicle to reinstate the caps, hopeful that a reconfigured DeSantis-appointed court will uphold them.
Representatives of families who’ve been barred under the law from filing lawsuits have repeatedly traveled to Tallahassee to share their stories of heartbreak and testify against what they call the “free kill” law as well as a regulatory system they say allows bad doctors to continue to practice medicine.
Opponents have dubbed the efforts to alter the law as “jackpot justice.”
Both sides squared off at the first stop of the bill.

Tallahassee orthopedic surgeon Andy Borom said he was “offended” by the “free kill” title.
“As if there’s a bunch of physicians who spent their entire adult lives training and taking care of patients who are sitting around salivating at the opportunity to kill people for free. That’s just gross,” he said.
Borom, 58, has been practicing medicine for 25 years. He said he’d consider expediting his retirement if the Legislature were to allow more lawsuits to be filed without capping noneconomic damages.
“There’s enough things that are punishing about the practice of medicine,” said Borom. “Right now, Medicare is cutting rates, the cost of medical practice goes up well in excess of the costs of reimbursement, and then you throw on the hazard of medical liability, which oftentimes doesn’t always comport with actual malpractice, sometimes it’s just somebody looking for a buck.”
He said the legislation could expedite his retirement by 10 years.
“That’s about 40,000 patients that won’t be seen, about 5,000 surgeries that won’t get done,” he said.
Jacksonville resident Cindy Jenkins testified before the House House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee October 15,2025.
Jacksonville resident Cindy Jenkins shared the story of how her 25-year- old daughter, Taylor Jenkins, died in a Florida hospital after waiting for emergency surgery. Devastated, she said she paid for a private autopsy, the results of which, she said, caused the medical examiner to change the cause of death on her death certificate.
She told the committee that following the experience she “set out on a mission to hold the hospital and doctors accountable and, with all due respect to those in favor of this law, I learned that the doctors got a free pass because my daughter had been 25 for two and a half months.”
Jenkins said she filed a complaint against the physician with the Florida Department of Health but that it was dismissed.
As she concluded her testimony, Jenkins countered the claims DeSantis made at a press conference announcing his veto, when he criticized the legislation because it did not reinstate caps on noneconomic damages. She also addressed opponents’ assertions that as many as 1,500 additional lawsuits could be filed if the law was changed.
“I do not want the grave of my dead child danced on nor 1,500 people per year to be able to have access to the courts in return for hurting the masses. I will wear the badge ‘free kill mom’ like honor,” she said, adding, “I will never agree to trade off opening courts to a small percentage of the people to hurt everybody.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the federal government remains closed over Senate Democrats’ health funding demands, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said the prospect of New Hampshire’s SNAP program halting keeps her up at night.
Earlier this month, the federal government shut down after the Senate failed to pass a spending plan. Republicans proposed a plan that would’ve kept funding largely at current levels. Democrats rejected that plan, saying they won’t vote for a package that doesn’t extend a set of tax credits used by Americans to purchase health coverage on HealthCare.gov that are set to expire in December. The Democrats put forth a spending plan that extends those subsidies and reverses many of the spending cuts Republicans instituted through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, at an additional cost of roughly $1 trillion. The sides could not reach an agreement before Oct. 1, causing all nonessential federal government services to cease.
That includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP or food stamps, which helps low-income Americans pay for food. The program is operated jointly by federal and state governments, but 100% of the benefits are paid for by the federal government. If Congress doesn’t approve a spending plan before Oct. 31, the federal government won’t provide the funding for the state to administer the program here.
“As governor, this is on my mind, and I think about it at night when I’m going to sleep,” Ayotte, a Republican, said during Wednesday’s Executive Council meeting. “And working with the commissioner (Lori Weaver of the Department of Health and Human Services) and her team on this, we will do everything we can to make sure that for people who need help with food insecurity and their children, that we do whatever we can with our state to make sure that they get what they need.”
Ayotte, a former U.S. senator who has criticized Congress’ failure to fund the government multiple times this month, noted “Washington can end this now.”
“If Washington gets their act together and would vote to fund the government, then we would not have this issue,” she said.
Chris Santaniello, associate commissioner of the state Department of Health and Human Services, told councilors the department was in “active conversation” with SNAP enrollees and is working with the USDA Food and Nutrition Service — though many employees at the FNS have been furloughed as a result of the shutdown — on a plan should the shutdown continue into November.
“The goal is to make sure no one goes without the benefit,” Santaniello said.
She said she didn’t yet have specifics on that plan to share.
“I’m glad to hear that you’re working on plans,” Councilor Karen Liot Hill, a Democrat, said. “Families need to know how they’re going to be able to send their kids to school not hungry, and be able to go to work not hungry.”
SNAP is facing other funding threats, too. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July, included a number of cuts to the program. The new law reduces the amount of benefits families receive by restricting the factors used to determine benefit amounts. It passes off much of the program’s administrative costs, which are currently covered by the federal government, to state governments, which may or may not be willing and able to cover them. It also caps future SNAP increases to the rate of inflation, bans many legal migrants (specifically refugees and asylees; people in the country without legal status were already ineligible) from receiving benefits through the program, and makes work requirements stricter. Those changes take effect at varying dates over the next few years.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ayottesnap-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

The state Department of Education released results of the college readiness exam Wednesday. South Dakota students earned an average composite score of 21. The highest possible score on the ACT is 36.
South Dakota’s results continued a trend of lower scores since the state’s recent high of 21.9 in 2018. The state averaged 21.1 in each of 2023 and 2024. The minimum score for acceptance at the state’s public universities is 18.
“These numbers reflect what we know to be true – that South Dakota students who take the ACT are well-prepared to move on following their K-12 careers,” said Secretary of Education Joe Graves in a news release.


The national average composite score this year is 19.4, which is the same as last year and an eighth straight year of lower or unimproved scores after a peak score of 21 in 2017. 
Sixty percent of South Dakota’s high school graduates took the ACT this year, according to the department. Of students who indicated they want to attend college, 75% said they plan to attend higher education institutions in South Dakota. Forty-one percent of South Dakota test-takers met college readiness in three or four academic skill areas: English, mathematics, reading and science.
Comparing states based on their average ACT scores is difficult, because not all states require the test, and the percentage of students taking it in each state varies widely. The state will require all South Dakota juniors to take the test beginning this spring, replacing the state assessment test administered to high school juniors.


“Providing all public-school juniors the opportunity to demonstrate their readiness this spring is an exciting and important step. Having an ACT score in hand can open doors to opportunities students may never have considered before,” Graves added. “I look forward to seeing students who would not typically take the ACT realize what their future may hold.”
South Dakota will join nine other states that reported 100% of students taking the ACT. Among those states, the average score was 18.2.
South Dakota’s average score of 21 for the roughly 60% of students who took the test is better or equal to states with the most similar participation rates, according to the ACT. Missouri, with 70% participation, reported 19.8; Hawaii, with 68% participation, reported 17.5; Minnesota, with 68% participation, reported 20.6; and Iowa, with 41% participation, reported 21.

Vermont Republican leaders continued to distance themselves from freshman Sen. Sam Douglass on Wednesday. During a press conference, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said his message for the Young Republicans was simple: “Clean up your act. Be good people.” 
The governor publicly called on the Orleans County senator to resign Tuesday after a Politico article outed Douglass, among other politicians in the Young Republicans, a national group, for exchanging racial slurs and derogatory messages in a group chat. 
Douglass, 27, has not resigned, despite calls for him to step down from both sides of the political spectrum. In a Wednesday press release, Douglass denounced the “vile and disgusting comments” included in the Politico story and said he had “cut ties with those involved.”

In a June exchange between former New York State Young Republicans co-chair Bobby Walker and chair Peter Giunta, Walker mentioned a mutual friend who had dated an “obese Indian woman,” according to the report. Giunta replied that the woman was not Indian, to which Douglass responded: “She just didn’t bathe often.”
After Douglass made a comment about a Jewish colleague potentially making a procedural mistake, his wife and national Young Republicans committee member Brianna Douglass responded, stating, “you’re giving nationals to (sic) much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”
Sam and Brianna’s comments are among thousands of racist, antisemitic and violent messages revealed in a leaked national Young Republicans group chat. Members in the chat referred to Black people as “the watermelon people,” and joked about killing political opponents and sending them “to the gas chamber.” Another chat member wrote, “I love Hitler.”
In his statement, Douglass suggested he had little to do with the chat, and said his role “was a procedural one about bylaws and floor strategy.”

“There were often periods of multiple days when I didn’t check this group chat and I was unfortunately unaware of those comments,” he wrote. “I should’ve been more vigilant, more careful, and less naive about who I associate with and my digital environments.
He added that his comment highlighted in the Politico story “was not a generalization and doesn’t represent my views or character.”
“I apologize so deeply to my constituents and colleagues that our county and state have been dragged into this,” he wrote. “I am currently weighing all my options to ensure that the outcome of this is what’s best for the safety and wellbeing of my family and my constituency, and I will make another statement before the end of the week.”
Group chat members in other states have faced similar calls for resignation from Republican counterparts. In New York, assemblyman Mike Reilly fired Giunta as his chief of staff over Giunta’s messages, according to SILive. 
Brianna Douglass was not made available for a comment after an interview request on Tuesday.
Earlier Wednesday afternoon, Scott said he and Douglass haven’t spoken since Scott made his Tuesday statement. He added that he has a zero tolerance policy for the language used in their messages. “What we saw in that article, we should reject it,” Scott said. 
“We’re better than that,” he added later on. 
Scott previously endorsed Douglass during Douglass’ campaign in the 2024 election. At the time, Scott posted pictures with Douglass touting his support for the prospective senator. On Wednesday afternoon, those posts were no longer visible on Scott’s accounts. 
Fellow Republican lawmakers from the Northeast Kingdom also disavowed Douglass on Wednesday in a statement signed by Sens. Russ Ingalls, Michael Marcotte, Richard Nelson and others. 
“This is a sad day for our party and for our state,” they wrote. “These comments have no place within our society as a whole and will not be tolerated.”
Vermont GOP Chair Paul Dame called the language used in the group chat “shocking and grotesque to all Republicans,” according to a press release issued Wednesday. He said he would be removing Douglass from the duties he has with the state party “until this matter is resolved.”
Douglass had been serving as the chair of the Republican Party in Orleans County and was an officer with the state chapter of Young Republicans. 
“If Sen. Douglass can not meet the minimum standard for informing the public about issues he is involved in, then I will also join the Governor and legislative colleagues in calling on him to resign,” he said in the press release.
While Dame suggested that the remarks attributed to Douglass “themselves were not bigoted or racist,” he noted that because of his participation in the group, “it has reflected poorly on himself, our party and Young Republicans everywhere.”
Sam Douglass works as a mental health professional with the Lamoille County Mental Health Services, and as a real estate agent. 
In a phone call, Jennifer Stratton, the head of the Lamoille County Mental Health Services, said the organization was “aware of the current situation” but said it was “an employee matter that we’re looking into.”
Stratton added the agency is “supportive of all people, of all races, cultures and religions” and that they “want all of the individuals we serve to feel safe and supported.”  
Douglass was among a number of Republican candidates that Scott and the GOP establishment campaigned for in the run up to the 2024 elections, building off of public concerns over taxes and affordability. Republicans secured multiple upset victories in the House and Senate, effectively dismantling the Democrat’s supermajority in the Legislature.
Six seats were flipped in the Senate, including the Orleans County seat now held by Douglass. Douglass beat Democrat Katherine Sims of Craftsbury, a state representative at the time, by more than 2,200 votes.
“Up in the Northeast Kingdom, we’re a very tight knit bunch, and we know when you’re not authentic,” Douglass told VTDigger after his victory. “This might be a little radical to say, but I don’t think it was Republicans that won. I think it was common sense that won.”
Scott endorsed Douglass during his 2024 campaign, appeared in a photo with him on social media and contributed money to his campaign. In the social media post, which has since been deleted, Scott said Douglass was “a common sense candidate who will always vote in the best interest of the Northeast Kingdom, regardless of party.”
“We need him in Montpelier, and I encourage the people of Orleans County to vote for Sam Douglass for state Senate,” Scott wrote.

(Pool photo by Travis Heying/Wichita Eagle)MARION — Former Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody probably committed a felony crime when he told a witness to delete text messages they exchanged before, during and after he led raids on a newspaper office and the publisher’s home, a district judge ruled Wednesday.
But Cody won’t be tried for the raids, which Marion County Record editor-publisher Eric Meyer says is the real crime.
A two-hour preliminary hearing revealed new details about the texts that Cody exchanged with Keri Newell, whose drunk driving record and request for a liquor license at her restaurant ignited an international drama two years ago. Newell took the stand and testified that Cody told her during a phone call to delete text messages between the two of them so that people wouldn’t get the wrong idea about whether they were romantically involved.
“Chief Cody had stated that he felt it would be in my best interest to delete those,” Newell said.
About six weeks after the raids, Newell texted Cody to say she was concerned about having deleted their earlier messages, she said. Cody replied that she was being paranoid.
Their exchange coincided with widespread scrutiny of the police raids in August 2023 of the newspaper office in flagrant disregard for the First Amendment and legal protections for journalists. Kansas Reflector first reported on the chilling raids.
Cody, working in coordination with the sheriff’s office, county attorney and Kansas Bureau of Investigation, had investigated whether Meyer and reporter Phyllis Zorn committed identity theft and other crimes by looking up Newell’s driving record in a public online database. A magistrate judge, ignoring the absence of evidence and state law, authorized the police raids of the newspaper office, Meyer’s home, and the home of city Councilwoman Ruth Herbel. Meyer’s 98-year-old mother died in distress a day later.
Police exceeded the scope of the search warrants by seizing reporters’ personal cellphones, work computers, and other equipment. Video showed Cody reviewing a reporter’s file on allegations that had been made against him.
At the KBI’s request, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation conducted a yearlong inquiry into whether Cody or anyone else had committed a crime. Special prosecutors Marc Bennett, of Sedgwick County, and Barry Wilkerson, of Riley County, cleared all law enforcement of any wrongdoing in carrying out the raids, which spawned five ongoing federal lawsuits.

However, CBI special agent John Zamora learned from talking to Newell that she had deleted text messages at his request, spanning a period of one week before to one week after the raids. 
The prosecutors presented an exhibit at Wednesday’s preliminary hearing that totaled 31 pages of text messages, including one where Cody said he was working with a publisher to write a book about the experience.
Zamora testified that he interviewed Newell in person in December 2023.
“Just tell me what’s happening,” he recalled telling her. “What’s going on here?”
Newell told him she agreed to delete texts, at Cody’s request, because she was worried that her now ex-husband would accuse her of having an affair with Cody, Zamora said.
Wilkerson asked Zamora, who has 30 years of law enforcement experience, if he had ever directed a witness to delete messages or documents.
“No,” Zamora said.
After talking to Newell, Zamora said, he obtained the deleted text messages from Jennifer Hill, the attorney who is defending the city and county from federal lawsuits over the raid. Cody, who had given her his cellphone, had not deleted the text messages himself.

Cody’s attorney, Sal Intagliata, of Wichita, cross-examined Zamora about his investigation. According to Intagliata, the special agent told Hill that he was just trying to “check all the boxes.” Zamora said he didn’t remember making the comment.
When Newell took the stand, she said she has had no communication with Cody since leaving town amid the controversy two years ago.
Zorn and Meyer sat front and center in the courtroom, with Zorn tightlipped and taking notes and Meyer in an incredulous slouch, newspaper tucked in his pants pocket.
Cody, who now lives in Hawaii, appeared by Zoom. He sat expressionless with his chin on his hand for most of the hearing.
District Judge Ryan Rosauer rejected Intagliata’s argument that it was “a legal impossibility” to blame Cody for deleting texts that he ultimately turned over himself. The judge found probable cause that Cody had committed the low-level felony crime of interfering with the judicial process by inducing a witness to withhold information in a criminal investigation.
Cody entered a not guilty plea, and Rosauer scheduled a trial for February.
If convicted, because he has no criminal history, Cody’s sentence would be presumptive probation.

In an interview after the hearing, Meyer said he was worried about the “big picture.”
“None of this has anything to do with the crime,” Meyer said, referring to the raids on his newsroom and home.
“This is not even about the case,” Meyer said. “This is about what he did after the case.”
He also said he was concerned that Cody was being made a scapegoat for the raids, despite the widespread involvement of other people and law enforcement agencies.
“We still want some statement, an official judgment of the court, that this was wrong, so that no one can use this excuse anymore that, ‘Oh, we aren’t sure that it’s illegal to raid newsrooms, and because we’re not completely sure, we can still do it,’ which seems like a stupid excuse to me,” Meyer said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101525cody_th1-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

Some Michigan GOP members have responded, including Krish Mathrani, who is the Youth Chair of the Michigan Republican Party. 
In a statement posted to X, Mathrani wrote, “I am deeply disturbed and outraged by the contents of the leaked Young Republicans group chat messages recently exposed by Politico. These messages — filled with racist epithets, antisemitic conspiracies, references to praise of Hitler, and dehumanizing language — are grotesque and must be denounced.”
He continued on to say that “There is no excuse or mitigation for this kind of rhetoric,” and called on Republicans and conservatives to condemn the chat publicly.   SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Others downplayed the messages. That included Meshawn Maddock, the former co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party and wife of state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford), responded on X to messages criticizing her for not denouncing the chat with GIFs reading “Blah, blah, blah” and “I’m still bored.” 
No member of Michigan’s Young Republicans chapter was named in the report as being a part of the group chat directly, but were referenced in the messages quoted by POLITICO. 
Specifically, POLITICO reported that Alex Dwyer, the chair of the Kansas Young Republicans, told the chat that he had been told by the vice chair of Michigan’s chapter that “My delegates I bring will vote for the most right wing person.” Peter Giunta, the chair of the New York State Young Republicans at the time, responded to that message saying, “Great. I love Hitler.”
“These messages are absolutely reprehensible and have no place in Michigan or anywhere else. The fact that Michigan Young Republicans are linked to this report makes the silence from Michigan’s Republican leadership even more alarming,” wrote Michigan Democratic Party chair Curtis Hertel, who specifically called on gubernatorial candidates Mike Rogers and John James to condemn the messages. “Every single leader has a moral obligation to condemn all forms of antisemitism, racism, and hatred – no exceptions and no qualifications.”
Neither the Michigan Republican Party nor the Michigan Young Republicans responded to requests for comment from the Michigan Advance, and neither group had posted to social media regarding the chat.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cellphone-1024x6831677068277-1.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 18:04:53.282818

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Leaders of environmental and democracy groups say that Gov. Phil Scott overstepped his authority when the Republican issued an order aimed at speeding up housing development by rolling back regulations last month. 
In a letter sent to top administration officials on Wednesday, the organizations claim the executive order — issued while lawmakers were not in session — “directly undermines the authority of the legislature and the separation of powers” established in the state Constitution.

The order made a suite of changes to housing permitting in Vermont that, given the state’s deep housing deficit, Scott and his allies argued could not wait until lawmakers reconvene in January. It alters rules for building in wetlands, allows builders to comply with older and less stringent energy efficiency codes, and changes timelines for decision making under Act 250, Vermont’s development review law, among other measures.
Lauren Hierl, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council – one of the groups that issued Wednesday’s letter – said policy decisions on these issues should be made via open discussion and debate. 
“Instead, we’re having to have this conversation about an illegal overreach of executive power, which is really frustrating and concerning,” she said. 
At a regularly-scheduled Wednesday press conference, Scott defended the administration’s decision to issue the order, but noted he had not yet been made aware of the groups’ opposition.
“We believe it’s in our authority,” Scott said. “We believe that housing has been stated as an emergency in Vermont.”
The letter asks state agency leaders to determine whether they have authority to carry out the changes in the executive order, while strongly suggesting that they lack it. If the agencies cannot prove that they have the authority, they should halt implementation of the order’s changes, the letter says.
At least one developer has signaled that the executive order might open up new options for their project. In Manchester, builders of a 43-unit project indicated last month that the governor’s amendment to wetland buffer areas might offer flexibility for the project’s design, according to reporting from the Manchester Journal. The development has drawn scrutiny for being sited in a flood-prone area.
The pro-housing lobbying group Let’s Build Homes praised Scott’s order last month. The group’s executive chair, Miro Weinberger, said in a text message on Wednesday that the group would not comment on the procedural and legal objections to the order.
“We continue to be appreciative that the Governor is attempting to use the independent authorities he does have to remove barriers to new homes,” Weinberger added.
Asked if the Vermont Natural Resources Council is considering pursuing legal action, Jon Groveman, the organization’s policy and water program director, said the council is giving the agencies a chance to respond and clear up the order’s implications “without having to go to court.” But the council will “consider all our options going forward” after the state responds, he added.
The letter is directed to Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Department of Public Service, and Janet Hurley, chair of the Land Use Review Board. In addition to the Vermont Natural Resources Council, it is signed by representatives from the Conservation Law Foundation, the Vermont chapter of the Sierra Club, Vermont Conservation Voters, Vermont Public Interest Research Group and the ACLU of Vermont.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Attorneys representing plaintiffs in a competency restoration settlement agreement are asking a judge to fine the Oklahoma Mental Health Department $10,000 a day for failing to meet required benchmarks. 
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services hasn’t met the required terms of the settlement yet, according to a September report from court-appointed consultants. This included providing consultants with “incomplete and internally conflicting” data, submitting plans missing essential information, and not demonstrating “true urgency” in carrying out the consent decree. 
The consent decree settled a 2023 lawsuit that alleged the Mental Health Department violated the rights of mostly indigent defendants who had been declared incompetent to stand trial by failing to provide timely court-ordered competency restoration treatment. The Legislature approved the settlement in March. 
Attorneys representing the plaintiffs filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on Monday. 
Paul DeMuro, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said it’s been seven months since the consent decree’s entry and four months past the deadline for the agency to have a plan to implement the consent decree’s requirements. 
“It wasn’t like (the consent decree) appeared out of thin air,” DeMuro said. “… What it boils down to is the department is treating this consent decree as if it were merely suggestions, as opposed to a federal court order.”
Hundreds of people are still “suffering” while awaiting treatment in custody, he said. This creates mental health emergencies, risk of physical harm and “ongoing violation of their due process rights,” DeMuro said. 
The plaintiffs’ request includes asking a judge to hold a hearing, impose a fine of $10,000 a day until an approved plan is implemented by the Mental Health Department, and ordering the agency to have one representative responsible for overseeing compliance. 
“Nothing motivates more than money,” DeMuro said. “So the fine is intended to motivate the department to get a plan together.”
The agency representative would offer “institutional knowledge” despite any leadership turnover, he said. Multiple agency heads have already been involved with the consent decree, DeMuro said. 
If ordered by the court, the requested fine would continue until the Mental Health Department develops and implements a plan that complies with the consent decree. 
“When this lawsuit was filed in March 2023, the Class Members were already suffering and in crisis due to unconstitutionally prolonged wait times for restoration services while languishing in county jails,” according to the motion. “More than two and one-half years later, due to Defendants’ willful failure to develop and implement the Court-ordered Plan, Class Members’ suffering persists with no relief in sight.”
The settlement is expected to cost between $26 million and $45 million over three to five years, depending on the agency’s ability to provide competency restoration services on a set timeline, as required. 
The Mental Health Department requested $17 million from the Legislature for next budget year to implement the consent decree and to cover any related fines for noncompliance. 
A spokesperson for the Mental Health Department did not immediately return a request for comment.

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderA woman who says she developed a medical condition after using a common hair product can continue legal action against the manufacturers after a decision from the Georgia Supreme Court released Wednesday.
The justices did not rule on the specifics of the woman’s case, but their decision could impact Georgians who say they have been harmed by prolonged exposure to many types of product.
Kiara Burroughs told the court she started using chemical hair relaxer products, which help straighten naturally curly hair, around 1995, including products manufactured by Strength of Nature and L’Oreal. She said she used them regularly between 1995 and 2001 and from 2002 to 2014.
In 2018, Burroughs was diagnosed with uterine fibroids, which are common, non-cancerous growths on the uterus. According to the Mayo Clinic, many women develop uterine fibroids but never know it because they usually cause no symptoms. In some cases, however, the growths can lead to serious pain or cause menstrual or urinary problems.
Burroughs filed suit against Strength of Nature and L’Oreal in October of 2022 after reading a study published that month finding a possible link between hair straightening products and uterine cancer.
The companies moved to dismiss the lawsuit because Burroughs’ first purchase of the products fell outside Georgia’s 10-year statute of repose, which says that legal action can’t be brought “after ten years from the date of the first sale for use or consumption of the personal property causing or otherwise bringing about the injury,” according to Georgia code.
Burroughs’ attorneys said her lawsuit is valid because she bought some of the hair relaxer within the 10-year window.
The Georgia Court of Appeals sided with the companies, agreeing that because she first bought the products as early as 1995, that earlier purchase set the “first sale” timer.
But the justices rejected that argument, finding that the phrase “first sale” in the state law refers to the retail sale to a user as opposed to any future resale.
“If that is what ‘first’ does in this provision—and it is—then there is no room for the manufacturers’ view that the word ‘first’ in this provision specifies which sale in a chain of sales to the same end user starts the statute of repose for the entire chain,” wrote Justice Andrew Pinson in the unanimous opinion. “That word cannot simultaneously carry a second, entirely different meaning and purpose, like a linguistic chameleon that changes its meaning and purpose on the fly depending on the facts of the case.”
The justices sought to keep the opinion narrow, noting that a plaintiff like Burroughs has the ultimate burden of proof that the units sold within the 10-year window were the cause of their injury – and they said that may prove difficult if a significant portion of the units were used outside the repose period.
In a concurring opinion written by Justice Charlie Bethel and joined by Chief Justice Nels Peterson and Justices John Ellington, Shawn Ellen LaGrua and Benjamin Land, Bethel emphasized that the court did not address the question of whether a claim could succeed if it relies in part on a theory that a plaintiff’s injuries were produced by a combined effect that includes products purchased both inside and outside the 10-year window.
Attorney Elizabeth Stone, part of the team representing Burroughs, celebrated the win and said the team looks forward to the discovery phase of the trial, “which will allow us to determine what the manufacturers knew about the potential health effects of their hair relaxer products on the consumers to whom the products were being marketed,” she said in an email.
“We look forward to continuing to pursue this litigation on behalf of Ms. Burroughs,” she added.
Stone said the opinion will set a precedent affecting any type of product liability claim brought about in Georgia, which could be significant for consumers looking to sue for injuries caused over a prolonged period.
“And we are certainly glad the Court has clarified that; given that we live in a time when science can identify dangerous products in more exacting fashion than in the past, the governing Georgia statute certainly needed some clarification,” she said.
Attorneys for Strength of Nature Global and L’Oreal USA responded to requests for comment with a statement they attributed to L’Oreal:
“We are disappointed by today’s ruling. However, this ruling only pertains to a procedural matter and we are pleased the Georgia Supreme Court made clear its decision does not relate to the cause of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. L’Oreal USA strictly follows all regulations in every market in which it operates, and its products are always subject to a rigorous scientific evaluation of their safety. The health and wellbeing of all our consumers are of utmost importance to us. We are confident in the safety of SoftSheen-Carson’s (a division of L’Oreal that markets hair care and beauty products designed for people of color) products and believe the allegations made in these lawsuits will be proven to have neither legal nor scientific merit.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 20:59:19+00:00,CT Mirror,CT finalizing plan to blunt funding cuts amid government shutdown,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/ct-special-session-funding-cuts/,CT legislators are planning a Nov. 12-13 special session to OK using up to $500 million to blunt federal cutbacks to human service programs.,"Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders have nearly wrapped plans to use part of last fiscal year’s historic state budget surplus to blunt federal cutbacks to vital human service programs.
The two sides won’t use more than $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus — the second-largest year-end cushion in state history — for a response fund, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said Wednesday.
But the two sides still haven’t settled on an amount, nor have they specified how and when funds might be disbursed to bolster certain programs.
Still, both Ritter and Looney said they expect the General Assembly to be called into special session Nov. 12 and 13 to approve a response fund.
“This fund is meant as a bridge,” Ritter told the Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday. “It’s a short-term fund that’s meant to address more immediate things” that may crop up between now and adoption of the next state budget in early May 2026.
Most of the big cutbacks in federal aid that President Donald Trump and Congress ordered last July won’t take effect until late 2026 or later, leaving Lamont and the General Assembly more time to plan a response.
But the partial federal government shutdown triggered Oct. 1 by congressional gridlock has created a host of short-term threats.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children — commonly known as WIC — already is out of money. Connecticut, which administers the federal program here, is fronting the $6 million needed monthly to maintain aid to about 52,000 infants, older children and women.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, which provides about $72 million in nutrition assistance to more than 391,000 Connecticut residents monthly, runs out of reserves in early November, according to the Lamont administration.
The same is true for the state’s winter heating assistance program, which is funded chiefly with federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program grants. The Lamont administration projects more than 100,375 households will need heating assistance this winter, up more than 12% from one year ago.
And the governor’s social services commissioner, Andrea Barton Reeves, said if the federal shutdown lasts until March, it likely would impact Medicaid, a massive program that pumped almost $7 billion in federal funding last year into nursing homes, at-home care services, hospitals, federally qualified health clinics and health insurance for low-income households in Connecticut.
Federal block grants that Connecticut uses to support community action agencies — regional nonprofits that link vulnerable households with housing, energy, employment, child care and other human services — also face a funding crunch in early 2026.
“I think that we are fortunate to have a response fund,” Looney said. “Many other states are facing the same cuts and crises but without the capacity” to temper those reductions.
The $2.5 billion surplus Connecticut generated in the fiscal year that closed June 30 represents 11% of the General Fund. Given that just one-quarter of the state budget involves discretionary funding, leaving 11% unspent is huge.
Since the General Assembly established an aggressive series of budget caps in 2017, Connecticut has generated an annual average surplus of $1.8 billion, or more than 8%.
State officials have used these surpluses to build reserves and shrink pension debt, though many concede that effort has taken a toll on education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
Looney also noted that even if $500 million from the last surplus is deposited in a response fund, there is plenty available to meet other needs.
Officials estimate about $220 million from that surplus would be added to the $4.1 billion already in Connecticut’s rainy day fund. This deposit would ensure the rainy day fund remains equal to 18% of annual operating costs, the maximum allowed by current law.
Another $300 million would be used, as Lamont and lawmakers agreed last spring, to launch a new effort to dramatically expand affordable child care services.
The remaining $1.5 billion would be used to further shrink pension debt, which entered last fiscal year at about $35 billion.
State Treasurer Erick Russell said Wednesday he remains confident that Wall Street credit rating agencies would not object to this plan for allocating state budget surplus.
“I think this is consistent with the work we have done and the track record of fiscal responsibility,” the Democratic treasurer said, adding it is prudent to protect programs against “the chaos, uncertainty and cruelty that’s coming out of Washington.”
Last spring, when Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress began planning big cutbacks in federal aid to states, majority Democrats in the General Assembly first proposed redirecting a portion of these big surpluses to supplant lost assistance and mitigate the deepest federal cuts.
Connecticut officials specifically planned two lines of defense: one for the short-term and another for down the road.
Next month’s special session would set aside funds to shore up holes in key programs during the fall and winter — whether caused by federal cuts or the government shutdown.
The long-term response is partially in place. State lawmakers modified one budget cap last spring, moving $600 million from the must-save category back into the General Fund for use in future years. But legislators still may need to modify another cap before those dollars can be used, and that’s unlikely to occur before the next state budget is adopted in May 2026.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, confirmed Wednesday only that the administration and Democratic legislative leaders continue to talk about a response fund.
“Nothing has been finalized at this time,” he said.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, criticized the response fund. Connecticut should be following Washington’s example, he said, and seeking first to tighten its own spending before tapping state reserves to bolster federal programs.
“The Democrats [in Connecticut] have become very unprincipled,” Candelora said, adding that if the economy slips into recession this winter, as some economists predict, the state budget surpluses that legislators are counting on could vanish quickly. 
“The legislature and the governor have already forgotten what happens when the economy goes south,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_6839-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The five-year legal battle over Idaho’s transgender athletics ban will continue, in at least one federal court.
On Tuesday, Chief U.S. District Court Judge David Nye kept the case alive in Idaho federal court, while a U.S. Supreme Court appeal is in limbo.
Lindsay Hecox, a Boise State University transgender student, has fought Idaho’s transgender athletics law since its passage in 2020. But Hecox has asked the Idaho federal court and the U.S. Supreme Court to drop her case. Hecox says she is focusing on graduating from college and no longer plans to play in women’s sports at Boise State.
The Supreme Court has not acted on Hecox’s request.
And while Nye said he was conflicted on the matter — and reluctant to force Hecox to continue a case she no longer wants to pursue — he says the state and the public have a vested interest in seeing the case through to a ruling.
“The state of Idaho has defended this case vigorously for years,” Nye wrote. “It would be fundamentally unfair to abandon the issue now on the eve of a final resolution.”
Attorney General Raúl Labrador hailed the ruling.
“This decision keeps our lawsuit alive, and I won’t stop until women and girls are safe to compete, participate, and excel in competitive sports,” Labrador said in a Wednesday news release.
Idaho’s first-in-the-nation law bans transgender athletes from competing in women’s and girls’ sports. The law is on hold; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has blocked it from going into effect.
Idaho has appealed the Circuit Court ruling, and in July, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.
If the Supreme Court indeed hears the case, rejecting Hecox’s motion to drop it, oral arguments are likely in January, Labrador’s office said Wednesday.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)During arguments in a Louisiana case, U.S. Supreme Court justices seemed open to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process, a move that would undermine a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. 
Conservative justices, who make up the court’s majority, seemed sympathetic to arguments made by Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga and President Donald Trump’s administration. They argued the consideration of race in the redistricting process violates Constitutional requirements that people are treated equally regardless of race. 
The case in question, Callais v. Louisiana, challenges the legality of a second majority-Black congressional district Republicans state lawmakers drew in 2024 in response to a federal court finding a 2022 version of the state’s congressional maps was unconstitutional. Louisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, but just one favored a Black candidate before the redistricting process in a state where nearly a third of the population is Black.
How we got here: Louisiana’s redistricting case puts the Voting Rights Act on trial 

The case has since been shaped into a test of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that prohibits racial discrimination in elections. Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.
The outcome of the case could have nationwide implications, as it could determine the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps after each decennial census. 
The Callais case is also notable because justices were originally supposed to rule on the case earlier this year. But in a rare move, they punted a decision to their next term. 
They also posed new questions for parties to answer: Did the Louisiana Legislature’s creation of a second majority-Black district violate the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution? 
​The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
The case is being carefully watched, as any ruling that cuts back on Section 2 would likely lead to states redrawing their congressional maps to eliminate majority minority districts.
Fair Fight Action, a progressive voting rights organization, predicts that if the Supreme Court sides with conservatives and hollows out Section 2, states could redraw up to 19 majority Black districts to make them competitive or safe seats for Republicans.
Though Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill originally defended the map challenged by Callais, her short-lived alliance with Black voters ended in September when Republicans and groups supporting Black voters filed opposing briefs. 
Attorneys representing the state, the Trump administration and the white voter plaintiffs in Callais argued the framework for proving a Section 2 violation should be modified. The so-called Gingles test, which arose from a 1986 Supreme Court ruling, set the standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards. 




The Gingles test
Created by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1986 case Thornburg v. Gingles, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions to prove racial vote dilution:

The racial or language minority group “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”
The minority group is politically cohesive
The majority votes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat the minority’s candidate of choice





Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh voted to uphold the constitutionality of Section 2 just two years ago in Allen v. Milligan, an Alabama case that required the addition of a majority-Black congressional district. Both asked questions during Callais arguments, indicating their openness to revisiting the recent precedent. 
“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time, sometimes for a long period of time, decades, in some cases,” Kavanaugh said, “but that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point.” 
Voting rights advocates note that the Gingles test provides a time limit unique to each situation. 
“Section 2, by itself, automatically sunsets as conditions on the ground get better,” Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive organization that follows redistricting issues throughout the country, said in an interview earlier this year. 
Kavanaugh also seemed sympathetic to U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer’s proposal that plaintiffs seeking judicial relief from a violation of Section 2 should be required to take a state’s political motivations into consideration when offering alternative districts. For example, this could include drawing a district to not just keep an incumbent in their district but to ensure the incumbent’s victory. 
“That suggestion would swallow Section 2 whole,” NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney Janai Nelson said. “Party cannot trump the responsibility of states to ensure that all voters have an equally open electoral process.” 
Nelson, representing Black voters, argued the Voting Rights Act is the sole reason there is Black representation in Louisiana. 
Until the Voting Rights Act was enacted, many promises of Reconstruction-era amendments to the Constitution were largely unfulfilled as Black voters were suppressed under racially oppressive Jim Crow laws. 
“[Section 2] is an intervention that has been crucial to diversifying leadership and providing an ability of minority voters to have an equal opportunity to participate in the process,” Nelson said. “But it also isn’t a permanent remedy. It corrects itself over time, and it’s only triggered when those extreme conditions exist.” 
Liberal justices on the court sharply questioned Aguiñaga and U.S. Principal Deputy Solicitor General Hashim Mooppan about their proposed changes to the Gingles framework. 
“The bottom line is, just get rid of Section 2,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor said of the pair’s arguments. 
Though conservatives advocate for an end to race-conscious redistricting under Section 2, Aguiñaga said other applications for the statute are “fair game.” Most Section 2 cases are about discrimination at the local government level, primarily challenges to at-large districts that critics say dilute minority voting strength.

Black voters react
As oral arguments were underway, hundreds gathered outside the court. Nearly two dozen advocacy organizations, including the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and the National Urban League, led a “Fight for Fair Maps” rally.
The Rev. Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO of the National Council of Negro Women, told the crowd that as a descendent of slaves in Florida and South Carolina, “I come with blood of resilience in my veins.”
“Every time you face opposition, just look at it and say, ‘No weapon against us shall prosper.’ Section 2 will be intact after they do their work inside that Supreme Court,” Arline-Bradley said. “And I stand on my 10 toes, ready to fight until justice is won.”
Fletcher Johnson of Baltimore stood among the rallygoers and said he’s concerned about voter suppression in next year’s congressional midterm election.
“We’re losing the country really fast, and we got to fight for every inch of it,” Johnson, 68, said. “So this, this decision here, is going to be critical to our voting rights, and they’re trying to dismantle everything that we’ve worked for.” 
Potential outcomes
There is no set date for when justices will rule on Callais, but it is likely to be next spring before the end of June. 
Justices could uphold Louisiana’s challenged 6th Congressional District, which Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, currently holds. This outcome would lead to few or no changes nationally. 
If justices overturn Fields’ district and remand the case to the state without addressing the constitutional questions, Louisiana would be required to adopt a new map that maintains two majority Black districts. State lawmakers would likely have to do so by picking a map preferred by Black voters, likely one with a district anchored in Northeast Louisiana that complies with more traditional redistricting principles than the one Republicans chose last year. 
This would also likely allow Fields to keep his seat. 
Or justices could overturn Fields’ district and set new precedent scaling back Section 2. That could give Republicans in Louisiana the opportunity to draw a map with one or even no majority Black districts, giving Republicans an opportunity to win Fields’ seat and the 2nd Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans. 
“For decades, the court’s conservative majority has chipped away at this landmark civil rights law,” Carter said at a news conference after the arguments. “Now section two, which prohibits voting practices that discriminate based on race, is on the chopping block.”
“If struck down, Louisiana could lose its two majority Black congressional districts, silencing Black voters,” Carter added. 
With the Trump administration leaning on states to carve out extra seats ahead of the 2026 midterms, other Republican-controlled states with majority minority districts could follow suit. 
In anticipation of the ruling, the Louisiana Legislature is considering a special session in the coming weeks to push back the qualification deadline for next year’s congressional elections. Doing so would give lawmakers enough time next year to adopt a new redistricting plan. 
In August, Gov. Landry directed lawmakers to set aside dates for another redistricting special session, but legislative leaders expressed reluctance to do so before justices made a decision in the Callais case.
Whether a decision will come in time to influence midterm election results will vary by state.

(Lance Cheung/USDA)TOPEKA — The federal government shutdown could mean Kansans who rely on food assistance will miss a November payment, and the state is working to determine options should that occur. The possibility troubles a Kansas City-area social services leader who said resources are already stretched to the breaking point. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Services notified regional offices Friday that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Funds may not go through in November if the federal government doesn’t reopen. 
“As stated in our lapse of appropriation correspondence dated October 1, 2025, SNAP has funding available for benefits and operations through the month of October. However, if the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation,” said a letter signed by Ronald Ward, acting associate administrator of the SNAP program at USDA.
In May 2025, 186,000 Kansans received SNAP benefits, at a cost of nearly $33 million, according to USDA data.
“The fact that many folks possibly may not receive benefits next month is really scary,” said Susila Jones, executive director of Cross-lines Community Outreach, Kansas City, Kansas. “Food insecurity is already at an all-time high in our area. It’s a concern for folks who already come to our pantry, and I’m assuming there will be a lot of people who have not needed to rely on pantries that may need them.”
Cross-Lines offers food and housing assistance in Wyandotte County, including operating a food kitchen and food pantry, where Kansans can receive food based on the size of their families, Jones said.
When the federal government shut down in 2019, many SNAP recipients experienced a long delay between payment of their monthly benefits before the shutdown was resolved, according to the federal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
The state received the notice and is evaluating what could be done for Kansas SNAP recipients, Erin La Row, spokeswoman for Kansas Department for Families and Children, said Wednesday. 
Jones said escalating inflation has caused most food pantries in the Kansas City area to struggle to keep food on their shelves. 
“Over the past year, but especially since the first of the year, we have seen an increase in need,” she said. “We can’t even keep up with it. We can only serve 100 people a day, and we meet that almost every day already.”
In the letter to SNAP regional directors, Ward said his agency is working to gather information to create contingency plans if needed. However, Ward said states that normally would be preparing their electronic transfer files to send out November payments are directed to hold those payments. 
On Sept. 30, the National WIC Association raised concerns that SNAP’s Women, Infant and Children program had only enough funds to make payments for a short time following the shutdown. 
“Every day of inaction brings us closer to a crisis,” said Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association. “Failure to rapidly reopen the government could result in State WIC directors being put in the horrible position of trying to manage their programs with insufficient funds.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/snapmarket-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

Pate said the Secretary of State’s office has confirmed the messages are not authentic.

“With the continued rise of election-related misinformation, we remind Iowans to always verify information through trusted sources: the Iowa Secretary of State’s Office or your local county auditor,” Pate said.
The news release noted there were many legitimate outreach campaigns for candidates competing in the approaching Nov. 4 city and school elections. Early and absentee voting in local elections began Wednesday.
However, the secretary of state’s office stated legitimate candidates and pollsters will not ask for sensitive information from voters. Additionally, the office recommended verifying the legitimacy of any links to donation sites sent through texts.
“We urge Iowans not to provide sensitive information over text, and if making plans to donate, to navigate separately to the candidate’s official donation channels,” Pate said. “If Iowans have any questions, we encourage them to turn to trusted sources of information and reach out directly to campaigns to validate any outreach.”

At a meeting this week, the embattled head of the agency repeatedly argued NorthWestern Energy hasn’t provided as much information to regulators as it should, especially about its new methane-fired plant in Laurel.
Molnar also said the PSC should examine a couple of aspects of the rate case to ensure customers don’t get saddled with costs they shouldn’t bear.
In June, the PSC held a hearing on the rate case, which was controversial. First, customers recall the PSC already approved a NorthWestern Energy settlement in October 2023 that increased rates 28% compared to the previous August.
The case also includes a question about who should pay for the new plant in Laurel, estimated to cost $320 million in August 2024. The utility built the plant without preapproval by the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern officials have argued the plant benefits customers, and the utility should recover costs from them.
However, energy watchdogs have said the company built the plant without regard to affordability for ratepayers or emissions, and the Montana Consumer Counsel said NorthWestern wants nearly $50 million from customers to pay for its own cost overruns.
At the meeting Tuesday, a PSC staff member confirmed staff were working on an analysis in the rate case, and it could include a recommendation similar to the one Molnar had made, but the report was still in the works.
The complex case included settlements NorthWestern negotiated with some parties, such as a coalition of large businesses, but not all of them.
For example, the Montana Environmental Information Center and Natural Resources Defense Council are among the parties that argued NorthWestern isn’t taking costs related to climate into consideration.
At the meeting this week, Molnar said he wanted to reject the negotiated settlements because the deals hide information from the public, and he wants a full accounting of costs related to the new plant in Laurel and old coal-fired plant at Colstrip.
But Commissioners Annie Bukacek and Jennifer Fielder pushed back against Molnar’s argument that the PSC needed to take action at that time.
Fielder said the Yellowstone County Generating Station, or the Laurel plant, largely wasn’t associated with a settlement.
Fielder also said the commission needed more information from Molnar to properly consider his idea, especially given the fact it had held eight days of hearings on the rate case this summer.
At one point, Fielder waved a piece of paper at him and said Molnar had provided a request on a single sheet “with nothing to substantiate it.”
“If we’re going to make a decision this big, we need to have some basis for it, besides what you just discussed in the microphone here today on the spot,” Fielder said.
Bukacek agreed it was important to receive information in writing.
She said some of the comments Molnar made at the meeting didn’t mesh with her recollection of the hearing, but Molnar accused her of delay.
He said he wanted the commission to reject “black box” settlements where the Public Service Commission doesn’t have complete information and other stakeholders and the public remain in the dark.
He said many questions about the plant went unanswered during the lengthy hearing in June, and the commissioners have a responsibility to dig into the true costs of energy.
“We’re paid big boy wages. It’s time to do a big boy job, and that means you study enough to ask good questions,” Molnar said.
Commissioner Bukacek, though, said some information that is part of settlements is legitimately confidential, such as potential compromises among parties or proprietary models, and a PSC staff member agreed.
Bukacek moved to defer the proposal from Molnar, but of the five commissioners, only she and Fielder supported it, and it failed.
Molnar then moved to reject NorthWestern’s partial settlement on the rate case and direct staff to schedule a hearing on the Yellowstone County Generating Station and Colstrip.
It drew support only from Commissioner Randy Pinocci and also failed, leaving the rate case pending.
A PSC staff member said the staff recommendation on the case is expected to be brought to commissioners by the middle of November, and the commission can take action before the end of the year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0026-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

University of Vermont Medical Center’s Steve Leffler is promoting a “course correction” as he takes over from former UVM Health network leader Sunny Eappen.

Steve Leffler, the president of UVM Medical Center, officially took the reins Wednesday as the new head of the rebranded UVM Health network. The new leadership signals a new vision for the hospital network, he and its board leadership say — one that emphasizes the hospitals’ work over the network’s.
Sunny Eappen’s resignation as the president and CEO at the network came the same week in mid-September that the state’s main health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, set restrictive budget conditions on UVM Medical Center and its sibling hospitals. Still, Tom Golonka, chair of the network’s board of trustees, said he was surprised by Eappen’s decision to leave.
As he was getting ready for a joint board meeting to discuss the issues that the care board raised during hearings about the network hospitals’ budgets, Golonka received a call from Eappen informing him of his decision, he said.

“The board didn’t have a chance to talk about it, we had a meeting scheduled the next week,” Golonka said. “This wasn’t any type of force. We were completely prepared to support him for a period.” 
At the Sept. 12 meeting of the Green Mountain Care Board, chair Owen Foster laid into the network, which includes the UVM Medical Center in Burlington, Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin, Porter Medical Center in Middlebury, three hospitals in eastern New York state, and a home health and hospice care provider. Foster outlined what he called a “corporate shell game” of funds moving from the Medical Center’s reserves to the network and its New York hospitals. 
The regulator’s chair also raised concerns about the high executive compensation and the widening gap between what the network’s leadership made each year and what its lowest paid employees earned — in 2024, 19 executives brought home a collective $3 million in bonuses alone.
Foster called the network both “physically and spiritually distant” from the needs of Vermonters and of the UVM Medical Center. 
“That was hard to hear,” Leffler told VTDigger in an Oct. 10 interview. “It became clear that the vision needed to evolve and change a little bit.”
Eappen took that message to heart, both Leffler and Golonka said. 
“After some really thoughtful reflection with the network board, [he] agreed that it’d be better to take a shift and for him to step away,” Leffler said. 
Sunny believed that his stepping down was the best thing for him to do for the sake of the organization, Golonka said. “I really applaud him for his leadership,” he added. “It takes a really strong leader to be able to say that, and to envision a future that doesn’t include him.”
Course correction 
The future that Leffler foresees will be network-lite, with more emphasis on allowing for the autonomy of its hospitals.  
“It’s not going to be top down from the network. The network’s kind of in the background,” he said. “It’s not the center of the solar system. It’s kind of on the outer fringes,” Leffler explained. 
“Now we are going to do a bit of course correction,” he added. “It’s a subtle shift, but it’s a giant shift at the same time.” 
Already, the network has rebranded, with a new website and logos reading University of Vermont Health, dropping “network” from its name.  
The new name echoes the labels used by Dartmouth Health — a network of six hospitals across New Hampshire and southern Vermont that includes a large academic medical center. It’s a model with more hospital autonomy that Leffler said he is looking to mirror.  He described a structure where hospitals and staff on the floor lead decisions and drive change by working primarily with their own boards. 
“I’m a big believer in [saying] the people close to the care know what’s best and know what needs to be done,” Leffler said. “If the network board is going to hear about six different hospitals, then how much time can you spend on any one issue?”
Previously, though, the network had answered that question by taking a heavier hand in management and governance, in the name of efficiency. 
Originally, each hospital board hired and fired its own presidents, and they approved their own budgets that then the network staff and board would review and approve, explained UVM Medical Center Board Chair Jesse Bridges. 
But as the network started to consolidate systems like their electronic medical records and human resources around 2022, the process quickly grew laborious and long. “It was process for the sake of process,” Bridges said. 
Those adjustments resulted in the current streamlined system, where the network board makes the final fiduciary decisions, with input and recommendations from the partner boards.
“Before, there wasn’t coordination or control,” Golonka, the network board chair, described. “We were not rowing in the same direction.” 
The challenge now is figuring out a governance structure that keeps all the boats moving in the same direction, while also letting each row on its own. To find that, “everything can be on the table,” Golonka said. 
Though the rhetoric and governance around the network may be changing, it’s clear that the network structure of the hospital group is not. Leffler and both board chairs voiced a strong belief in the efficiencies that can come from the larger structure, for things like buying materials in bulk or streamlining HR processes and medical records. 
Increasing quality 
At the top of Leffler’s to-do list in the new role will be improving quality of care. 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assigns hospitals quality ratings, and the network hospitals’ numbers have dropped since 2022. Leffler is set on earning back UVM’s stars. 
“At the very first meeting, we’re getting every quality scorecard from 2025 that we have, and we’re going to go over them. We’re going to make a commitment, all of us, every hospital, every clinic, every office, how we’re going to improve them over (20)26,” he said. 
To do so, he wants those on the floor to lead the way, rather than having the network institute top-down changes. 
Improvements to safety for patients and staff, increased access for rural patients, and improved affordability all fall on Leffler’s wishlist of what to address in his new role, he said. UVM Medical Center, where Leffler will remain in charge, is set to continue to play a key role.
“If we’re not playing the right role in all of those areas (of affordability and access), because we’re the biggest, everyone is going to be pointing at us saying, ‘You’re not doing your part,’ ” said Bridges, the medical center’s board chair. 
Bridges cited the network’s recent partnership with Dartmouth Health on kidney transplant surgery. After UVM Medical Center averaged about 12 surgeries a year, it simply wasn’t cost effective to continue offering that care, as a state-commissioned consultant’s report on health care costs found. The partnership with Dartmouth allows patients to do pre- and post- surgery care in Burlington despite having surgery in the New Hampshire hospital.
“Access might have to look different in order to get at affordability and quality,” Bridges said, adding that it will require the network to look within its own system while also thinking on broader scales of partnerships at the state and regional levels. 
Born and raised
Eappen joined the network in 2022 as it was still navigating the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic. He came to Vermont after working as an administrator for 14 years at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. Under his leadership, the network saw more integration of processes and began to operate as an interlocking system, rather than a collection of affiliated hospitals, Leffler and Golonka both echoed. 
Eappen took over after John Brumstead had led the hospital system for over a decade. Brumstead created the network, overseeing the initial effort to join UVM Medical Center with Central Vermont Medical Center, in 2011. The partnership grew to encompass six hospitals in the ensuing six years, taking the name University of Vermont Health Network in 2014.
“At the time Sunny was just the right guy to transition from John Brumstead, who was this kind of Vermont icon,” said Betsy Vicencio, the network board’s vice chair.
“Sunny just had a different way of trying to invite change and trying to invite new relationships. Clearly some were really successful and some that were maybe less than successful,” she said. “Vermont and New York, we don’t necessarily do different as well as other places. We have some cultural limits that are hard.”
Though Vicencio said she does not think Eappen himself focused or worried about being from outside Vermont, she does suspect that his Boston background contributed to some of the external pressures that ultimately led to his departure. 
“It is absolutely within the cultural ethos of upstate New York and Vermont to not be as welcoming to people that are not born and raised here,” she said. 
With Leffler, the network is returning to homegrown leadership. 
He grew up in Leicester, Vt., where his parents owned a general store, he said. He completed medical school at the University of Vermont, before returning to the emergency department as a young doctor in 1993. He led the emergency department from 2006 to 2011, worked as the hospital’s chief medical officer, and then became the president of the medical center in 2020. 
“I really care about this region. I care about the medical center. It’s my home. I care about the care that we deliver to my friends, my family, my kids and my grandkids,” Leffler said. 
“Steve is Vermont’s beloved son, and he is Vermont’s beloved emergency room doc,” Vicencio said. “He is rural health care at its finest. He lives and breathes and has grown up in all of the things that are foundational to rural health care.” 
She recalled first meeting Leffler at a trustee event when he first stepped into a leadership role nearly 10 years ago. She began asking him about how the hospital could possibly bring down health care costs and watched Leffler light up with ideas: “He was super energized, and he had a vision back then.” 
“I think that he’s going to come in with this kind of refreshed view of making those particular pieces not just rhetoric, but real,” Vicencio said. 
Bridges, of the medical center board, echoed that: “Even though [Leffler] has been here, it’s not going to be more of the same. It’s actually, I think, a fairly substantial change on the horizon.” 
As part of his board chair role, Bridges does rounds through the hospital with Leffler every month. Through that, he’s come to know Leffler as an “honest broker” and eager listener, he said, having watched Leffler pay considerate attention to any patient or provider who approached him. 
“I think part of what makes Steve successful is his willingness to listen, be humble, admit maybe when he said something has come out the wrong way,” Bridges said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of a panel tasked with selecting the crop of candidates to become Iowa State University’s next president are set to decide on finalists next week, having narrowed the field to eight semifinalists.
The ISU Presidential Search Committee will spend two days next week interviewing semifinalists for the university’s presidency before announcing finalists and inviting them to campus for further interviews and open forums.
Each of the candidates, identified by numbers to keep their identities confidential until finalists are announced, were selected by the committee from a pool of 78 people, according to an announcement from ISU. The committee spent nearly four hours in closed session in early October to go through the applications.

With ISU President Wendy Wintersteen set to retire in January, the presidential search committee this summer set a timeline to find her successor that was described as “very, very, very tight” by AGB Search Managing Principal Rodrick McDavis during the committee’s first meeting.
Semifinalist interviews will be conducted virtually on Oct. 21-22, according to an agenda for the meetings, and the number of selected finalists will be announced following their conclusion.
Committee chair and ISU Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette said during the board’s Oct. 6 meeting finalists’ names will be released the day before they come to campus. On-campus interviews will take place in the first week of November.
Once they make it to Ames, Gillette said finalists will meet with “selected members of the campus community” and host a forum that will be open to the public and livestreamed for those who can’t come in person.
“On Nov. 11, the board of regents will review each finalist in closed session, and late that day make their selection for the next president of Iowa State University,” Gillette said.
Qualities the committee has decided they’re looking for in a potential ISU president include the ability to connect to and converse with people from all areas of campus and community, experiences and understanding of higher education and challenges the sector currently faces, and knowledge of budgeting, fundraising and other financial aspects of university leadership.
The best candidates must also be able to look ahead and craft a vision for the future of ISU that will help it navigate change and thrive, the committee decided.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A federal Rhode Island judge who struck down a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) directive withholding disaster aid from states that defy President Donald Trump’s immigration policies says the Trump administration is violating his order.
U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith in September ruled that the Department of Homeland Security directive making enforcement of Trump’s immigration agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief grants was unconstitutional and harmful to states and their residents.
Yet Smith found the department has continued to attach the condition to FEMA grants as part of a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make” or else risk losing funding already appropriated by Congress.
“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids,” Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in a ruling Tuesday. 
R.I. federal judge strikes down Trump edict tying federal disaster aid to immigration

A filing by a coalition of 20 Democratic attorneys general that sued the department over the grant conditions in May accused the Trump administration of violating Smith’s order. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading the case, Illinois v. Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The Oct. 8 motion asking Smith to enforce the order noted that states and municipalities in late September received award letters in which FEMA “copy-pasted the contested conditions” with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.
“Plaintiff States are, as a result, still required to certify, as a condition of obtaining federal funds,” they wrote.
AGs attached letters received by emergency management agencies in California, Colorado and Illinois. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency has not received any letters with the immigration language as of Wednesday, spokesperson Courtney Marciano said in an interview.
Smith ordered the Department of Homeland Security to permanently stop enforcing immigration conditions against plaintiff states and that the agency must amend grant awards within seven days to remove language related to complying with federal immigration law.
A Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for inquiry on whether officials intend to comply with the new court order.
The Trump administration argued in an Oct. 10 court filing that it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and was only seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions should the ruling be overturned.
“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. “The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”
But Smith in his ruling Tuesday said that no matter how confident the Trump administration may be of their chances of appeal, the contested conditions at the moment are unlawful.
“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote.
Neronha commended Smith’s latest ruling against what he called “blatant overreach” by the Trump administration in ignoring the September court order.
“Whether it’s a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or some other enforcement, the courts are holding up,” he said in a statement. “And we will continue fighting for the American people for as long as this administration puts them in harm’s way.”
Besides Rhode Island and Illinois, other states that were part of the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont. The District of Columbia is also part of the case.

Phil Murphy in 2021 ordered closed.,"Gov. Phil Murphy participates in a groundbreaking for a new Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Chesterfield on Oct. 15, 2025.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers officially kicked off construction of a new 420-bed, $310 million state prison for women Wednesday with a groundbreaking ceremony beside a sprawling, grassy field in Chesterfield, where the troubled Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women will relocate.
The new mixed-custody prison will replace a decaying 112-year-old facility in Clinton that Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021 ordered closed after more than a dozen correctional officers were arrested for brutally assaulting incarcerated women during a violent night of forced cell extractions.
The first phase of the project is expected to open in 2027, with construction scheduled to be fully completed in 2028.

Just before officials shoveled dirt Wednesday to mark the coming construction, Murphy alluded to the prison’s longstanding troubles, which include widespread sexual misconduct that prompted federal authorities to intervene and declare oversight.
“For decades, Edna Mahan has stood as a shameful symbol of a deeply flawed status quo,” Murphy said.
Replacing the “woefully outdated” prison will better protect incarcerated women while improving working conditions for officers, he added. And relocating it from the western reaches of Hunterdon County to a 33-acre state plot in centrally located Burlington County will make it more accessible for families who want to visit their incarcerated loved ones, officials said.
“By closing Edna Mahan once and for all, we will save our state’s taxpayers more than $160 million in what would have been much-needed capital projects that would have been the ultimate good-money-after-bad story,” Murphy said. “So today, we’re beginning a new chapter for criminal justice in New Jersey.”
Since the 2021 arrests, state Department of Corrections officials have made changes to ensure a “cultural reformation” too, including requiring officers to wear body cameras and implementing trauma- and gender-informed training, said Victoria Kuhn, the department’s commissioner. The new prison will also have expanded vocational and educational programs, social services, and addiction treatment, officials said.

“When the doors of this new facility open, the foundation for its success will have already been poured with the reforms that we have implemented,” Kuhn said.
The groundbreaking came less than two weeks after a state judge dismissed the criminal indictment of 14 correctional officers arrested in the 2021 beatdown at Edna Mahan. The judge declared the indictment unconstitutionally vague and said a four-year delay in preparing the case for trial constituted “negligence” by prosecutors in the public integrity and accountability office overseen by the state attorney general.
The dismissal prompted complaints that incarcerated women were denied justice and bipartisan calls for an independent investigation and oversight of the office.
But the indictment and its dismissal got nary a peep at Wednesday’s groundbreaking, with Murphy telling reporters after the ceremony that he was “extremely bitter, disappointed, and angry” but otherwise couldn’t comment because the Attorney General’s Office is appealing.
Advocates and Kuhn, though, did talk up legislation now in the Statehouse pipeline that would codify protections for incarcerated women in New Jersey by beefing up oversight, officer training, sexual misconduct safeguards, and rehabilitation and reentry programs and services. Kuhn said she expects the bill will advance after lawmakers return to Trenton in November.
“We want to ensure that all of those protections continue in perpetuity, so that there is never a dialing back to where we were decades ago,” Kuhn told the New Jersey Monitor.
Terry Schuster, the state corrections ombudsperson, seconded support for the bill and called on legislators to act quickly, with the current legislative session set to end and a new governor taking office in January. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who’s running against Democrat Mikie Sherrill in the race to replace term-limited Murphy, is expected to backtrack some criminal justice reforms implemented during the Murphy and Christie administrations and has often vowed on the campaign trail to “uncuff law enforcement.”

“We don’t know what’s going to happen with the election. We don’t know what’s going to happen with the leadership of the department,” Schuster told the New Jersey Monitor. “We want to make sure that the policy changes that have happened in the last few years really become harder to roll back.”
The new Edna Mahan prison will be a short stroll from the Albert C. Wagner Youth Correctional Facility, an unused prison that closed in 2017, as well as the Garden State Youth Center, which replaced Wagner and now incarcerates about 1,000 young men.
Prison conditions have been a grievance for years for criminal justice reformers, with many lockups in varying stages of disrepair. 
Kuhn and Murphy told reporters Wednesday that updates to other facilities are stalled because of funding.
“With a limited budget, a limited amount of money, you’ve got to prioritize, like anything else in life,” Murphy said. “And I feel very confident and comfortable that this was our top priority. And this is a big day, in that respect.”

(Via Florida Department of Corrections)Sounding as desperate as he ever has since being appointed four years ago, Florida Department of Corrections (FDC) Secretary Ricky Dixon asked a panel of state lawmakers Wednesday for more than $512 million for next fiscal year to maintain the prison system.
“It is a staggering amount of money that we’re asking for. I’m aware of that,” Dixon told the Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice. Adding to the scale of the needs, he said that amount did not include funding for salaries of correction officers, which he said rank among the lowest for its size in the country.
“If I continue to do this job, we’re going to have to have the support we need, because we cannot keep going in the direction we’re going in,” he added for emphasis.
Florida houses more than 89,000 inmates in its corrections system, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. That is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“We are managing today with relatively the same number of staff we had 10,000 inmates ago, so you can imagine what that’s doing to the staff and inmate ratios,” Dixon said.
The system includes officers as young as 19 with fewer than two weeks’ experience supervising more than 150 inmates in some correction facilities. That’s compared to ratios of one officer to 35 or one officer to 50 inmates in other states, he added.
Starting salaries for Florida correction officers begin at $22 an hour, an annual salary of $45,760. That pales in comparison to nearby Alabama, where legislators two years ago raised the minimum annual salary for correction officer trainees to more than $55,000 at a maximum secure facility (and Dixon said it actually went as high as $73,000).
Funding issues aren’t new
The numbers Dixon cited should have surprised none of the lawmakers on the committee. Many of them served in the Senate a few years ago when a study by the consulting firm KPMG recommended the state immediately appropriate more than $2 billion for immediate repairs and to develop a strategy to modernize the system.
The report added that the full costs of modernizing the state’s prison system would range between $6 billion and nearly $12 billion.
Among some of the specific requests by Dixon is $155 million in operational needs; $60 million in inmate health services; $56.4 million in new housing units; $45 million in drug costs; and $22 million in critical security equipment.
“What this does not include is the pay,” Dixon said, adding that he hopes to “remain competitive” on salaries.
Overtime costs piling up
Reviewing state records showing that the Department of Corrections spent $150 million on overtime last year, Sen. Clay Yarborough, R-Jacksonville, asked Dixon why the state was paying “such a vast amount.”
Dixon cited the addition of approximately 10,000 inmates in recent years.
“They have to live somewhere,” he said. “We have to reopen the dorms that we’re previously closed. We don’t have staffing for those dorms, so we have to pull staffing from one shift to the next and it requires a lot of double shifts to man those dorms. So, that drives that overtime rate up.”
While this Senate committee is focused on funding, not policies, Sen. Rosalind Osgood, D-Fort Lauderdale, mused to Dixon about reducing the state’s inmate population by allowing some elderly prisoners to be released. “Geriatric parole” is legislatively authorized in 24 states around the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
“If I had been in jail 20 to 25 years and I haven’t killed a bunch of people [or] did something horrific, maybe I was just high chasing drugs — I don’t know — but we gotta begin to look at adding some measure of grace for people who we can be comfortable with that they paid a consequence and maybe looking to spend money to transition them back into society in a more cost effective way,” she said.
“I stay in my lane when it comes to who should be in our system and who shouldn’t be,” Dixon replied. “That’s worthy of debate and certainly is debated and should continue to be debated.”
Those debates haven’t taken place in the Florida Legislature, however. One specific measure that would have allowed certain long-time prison sentences to become parole-eligible under certain circumstances introduced in the 2025 legislative session never received a hearing in any committee.

A proposed ordinance sponsored by Mayor Shelley Berkley and Councilwoman Nancy Brune would ban sales in new pet stores and allow existing stores three years to adjust their business model before the ban takes effect.
“With 13 stores, the City of Las Vegas has more stores than 37 states,” Rebecca Goff of Humane World for Animals said at a meeting Monday of the city’s Recommending Committee, which forwards legislation to the council agenda. The item is scheduled for a Nov. 5 hearing before the City Council. 
Goff and former State Sen. Warren Hardy led the unsuccessful legislative effort this year to ban pet sales statewide, which was derailed by lobbyists for the industry. Similar campaigns nationwide are designed to cut off markets to breeders who operate unsanitary and inhumane puppy mills, according to advocates. 
But Alyssa Miller-Hurley, a lobbyist for the Pet Advocacy Network, which opposes the ban on behalf of the pet stores it represents, and opposed the statewide ban, told the committee “these kinds of ordinances do not achieve what they set out to do.” She cited a Los Angeles Times investigation that revealed dogs were being transported to California and sold by middlemen following a statewide ban enacted in 2019.  
Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed bills designed to close the loopholes identified by the Times investigation. One law bans online sales by brokers, who are defined as individuals or businesses that sell or transport a dog bred by someone else for profit. 
In 2017, the Las Vegas City Council split 4 to 3 when it repealed a 2016 ordinance banning the sale of pets in stores. Under pressure from pet stores and prominent lobbyist Jay Brown, Mayor Carolyn Goodman, Councilwoman Michele Fiore, Councilman Ricki Barlow, and Councilman Steve Seroka voted to repeal. 
The original version of the bill sponsored by Berkley and Brune would have banned pet sales only in new stores, while allowing sales to continue in existing stores – a model embraced by the City of Henderson. 
“There are nearly 800 animals on our campus today at the Animal Foundation,” the organization’s CEO Hilarie Grey told the committee. “With so many animals of every breed, size and age, including puppies and kittens of every breed available for adoption, there’s just no reason for the puppy mill pipeline and sales to continue. People can find the animal of their choice.
The Animal Foundation receives close to $11.5 million a year from Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Clark County, and routinely euthanizes animals for lack of space. Last year the shelter put down 2,047 dogs and 1,271 cats, many of them healthy and adoptable. 
Rachel Bergren, the executive director of Heaven Can Wait, a low-cost, high-volume spay and neuter clinic, noted 2028 “seems like a long time away, but we know it will be here soon.” 
Bergren noted that “every day in our spay and neuter clinic, I see the reality of animal overpopulation. Our local shelters, as we’ve heard, are full, and our clinic has a neverending waiting list for spay and neuter, vaccination and microchipping services. We just can’t meet the need. We simply do not have the resources in this city or in this region to meet the basic needs of animals that are already in our community.” 
The Las Vegas Valley Humane Society appreciates the intent of the ordinance, but opposes a delayed ban, representative Bridget Murphy told the committee. 
“If Las Vegas truly wants to be a leader in animal welfare, we should not grandfather in businesses that profit from the suffering of animals,” Murphy said. “Rather, we should impose a complete ban on the retail sale of animals and direct our support instead towards reputable shelters and rescues.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dogpoundpuppy-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The state’s HAVA Grant Board, which administers federal money from the Help America Vote Act, met virtually to approve grant requests from Lyman, Oglala Lakota and Todd counties. Those counties are home to much of the Lower Brule, Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations.

The board voted unanimously to fund the three counties’ requests, totaling about $50,000, to operate in-person, satellite voting sites during the 2026 election cycle. The satellite locations are in addition to early voting and election-day polling places typically located in county courthouses.
Lyman County received $17,800 to hire poll workers, pay travel expenses and rent space for a temporary voting site. Oglala Lakota County was approved for $25,400 for similar expenses, and Todd County received $6,500.
Courts have repeatedly found that South Dakota and some counties have failed to provide equal access to polling locations, registration opportunities and early voting for Native Americans. In some of those lawsuits, judges have ruled that without such voting sites, those Native American voters faced barriers that violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

With the House out of session these days — lest any pesky votes to release the Epstein files come up — Emmer seems to have settled into a role as House Republicans’ demagogue.
“The Democrats,” Emmer said this week, “would rather cater to the pro-terrorist wing of their party than to reopen the government.”
This follows up last week’s gem: “This is about one thing and one thing alone,” he said about the government shutdown, “to score political points with the terrorist wing of their party, which is set to hold a hate America rally in D.C next week.”
To use this kind of language is peculiar: I was reliably informed just weeks ago that right-wing star Charlie Kirk’s killing was the result of inciteful language that some of us have used to describe the Republicans’ fascistic turn, but I digress.
Let’s talk about the “hate America” rally that Emmer referred to, known as “No Kings” and being held in 2,500 locations nationwide, including 69 Minnesota cities, among them such hotbeds of anti-American fervor as New Ulm and Owatonna and — in Emmer’s own district! — St. Cloud. 
At the last No Kings rally, in June, Joan Nelson, 82, talked to a Reformer reporter. She was attending a political rally for just the second time in her life, she said, but there she was, with her daughter and granddaughter, too. 
Three generations of America hating! 
The June rally was the same day of the assassination of Mark and Rep. Melissa Hortman, but thousands turned out anyway at the Minnesota Capitol, to demand an end to the unconstitutional actions of an executive run amok. 
Among the people likely to attend Saturday’s No Kings rally: My 76-year old mother-in-law visiting us this weekend, a suburban retiree who spent nearly four decades as a Montgomery County, Md., librarian. 
She married her college sweetheart, an Iranian immigrant. (You wanna hear someone bag on about a regime? Ask my father-in-law about the mullahs.) Massoud was a literal rocket scientist  for decades, helping defend America, including as part of a team that developed the technology we now know as GPS. (Massoud, who has a history of voting for minor party candidates for president, emphasized to me that he won’t be at the protest.) 
They worked hard and sent their kids to college. They go to the beach once a year for a week and invite us along. Massoud likes hockey and country music. (Weird, perhaps, but I don’t judge.) Lisa occasionally, um, borrows our HBO Max password and likes Broadway showtunes. Massoud keeps a lovely yard, and Lisa runs a book club and blogs about her reading.
Theirs is a deeply American story. 
Lisa will join teachers, veterans, tradesmen, nurses and doctors, business people — and no doubt plenty of other librarians — who will go to the rally to express the most American idea ever: They are citizens who share in self-governance, not subjects of a monarch or tyrant. 
Let’s explore why this is called “No Kings.” 
Trump has sent the National Guard from his allied red states to American cities that have no want or use for them. 
He’s ordered masked federal agents to sweep up people without warrants. He’s violated their due process rights and in some cases sent them to repressive foreign lands known for human rights abuses. 
He has ordered career prosecutors to go after his political enemies, and to spare his political friends. He has fired career public servants who refused his unethical orders. 
He has pardoned the people who stormed the Capitol and assaulted police officers in their failed coup attempt. 
He and his family have collected billions of dollars in foreign money while doling out favors — like the right to sell sophisticated technology to the Chinese — to the very same foreign oligarchs. 
And, he’s openly musing about another term despite the Constitution’s prohibition. 
Hey Tom Emmer: Someone around here seems to hate America, or at least the one most of us grew up with. But it’s not my mother-in-law or the millions who will join her across the country Saturday, in burgs and villages and big cities and in your own 6th District, from sea to shining sea, to remind the regime that we are not a nation governed by monarchs and never shall be.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1754127433.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

Amy Neighbors, R-Edmonton, and Dr. Whitney Jones, the founder of the Colon Cancer Prevention Project and the previous chair of the Kentucky Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Advisory Committee, discuss cancer screening and prevention. Oct. 15, 2025. (Screenshot)The Kentucky Colon Cancer Screening Program has asked the General Assembly for an increase in state funding from $500,000 per year to $1.25 million annually in the 2026 legislative session. 
Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, called the increased funding for the organization, whose advisory committee he sits on, “miniscule” in light of the impact cancer screening has on Kentuckians and on money saved down the road. 
Representatives with the Kentucky Colon Cancer Screening Program told the Budget Review Subcommittee on Health & Family Services Wednesday that early detection saves many lives and $67 million each year because fewer people need later-stage intensive treatments. 
“One of my greatest frustrations as a legislator is we never take the time to measure the cost of doing nothing,” Meredith said. “And even though we’ve seen great improvement in colon cancer screening and reducing deaths, the work’s not done yet.” 
Dr. Whitney Jones, the founder of the Colon Cancer Prevention Project and the previous chair of the Kentucky Colon Cancer Screening and Prevention Advisory Committee, said that widespread screening has saved 270 people each year “who don’t die from colon cancer” and 640 people annually who “don’t get colon cancer because we found their polyps and we skipped their cancers.” 
The program provides free screenings for eligible Kentucky residents who are low income and uninsured, age 45 or older or those who are younger than 45 but are at high risk because of family history. The program budget request states demand is “projected to exceed available resources by 2026” and with the additional funds, “​​upward of 300+ colonoscopies could be completed.” 
Rep. Amy Neighbors, R-Edmonton, told her fellow lawmakers from the presenter’s table: “Early detection saved my life, and I don’t want anyone in Kentucky to miss that same chance.” 
“I am an early age onset colorectal cancer survivor, and I often think about how differently my story could have turned out if I had been uninsured or if I hadn’t had access to a timely colonoscopy,” Neighbors said. “Kentucky still has the highest colorectal cancer rates in the nation and one of the highest for early age onset. We can change that, but only if we invest in prevention, in education, on time screening based on family history and quick response to warning symptoms.”  
American Cancer Society data shows that Kentucky has both a high prevalence of cancer screenings as well as a high cancer mortality rate. Cancer mortality has decreased, however, in the state over at least the last decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Preventing late stage cancer saves both lives and health care dollars by avoiding the enormous costs of advanced treatment,” Neighbors said. “No Kentuckian should ever lose their life simply because they can’t afford or access a colonoscopy.” 
During the interim, legislative committees are fielding requests for money from a variety of organizations ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 6. During the 60-day session in Frankfort, lawmakers will pass the next two-year state budget.

Immigration judges are continuing to deny bond hearings for detainees in Iowa and throughout the country, despite being repeatedly overruled by federal district court judges.
Five weeks ago, immigration judges across the country formally adopted the U.S. Department of Justice’s new legal position that detainees suspected of entering the country illegally can be held in jail indefinitely without being afforded a hearing on whether they’re entitled to release on bond while their case is pending.
The immigration judges’ stance stems from a September 2025 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals agreeing with the Trump administration’s position that detainees are not entitled to such hearings.
The board’s decision endorsing that view has upended decades of past practice in which immigration judges — who are not part of the judicial branch, and are instead part of the executive branch and the DOJ — released individuals on bond in cases where the detainees were not considered a flight risk or a danger to the public.
In the past few months, hundreds of detainees have sought relief by seeking the intervention of U.S. District Court judges, arguing that being held under such circumstances is a violation of their right to due process.
In an overwhelming number of such cases, the federal judges have sided with the detainees, ordering the immigration judges to hold bond hearings at which the detainees can argue that their history, employment, family obligations or other circumstances warrant their temporary release on bond.
Despite those rulings in U.S. District Court, immigration judges continue to deny bond hearings, leading to even more federal court cases seeking injunctions.
More Iowa detainees seek court intervention 
Among the most recent Iowa cases is that of Filemon Brito Barrajas, a citizen of Mexico who says he has lived in the United States for 20 years without legal status. Court records indicate Barrajas had no criminal record until July of this year, when he was jailed on a charge of contempt of court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement then issued a detainer for him, keeping him in jail after he’d served his sentence for contempt.
On Aug. 18, 2025, Barrajas requested a bond hearing, but was denied by an immigration judge who concluded he lacked jurisdiction, echoing the DOJ’s position on the issue.
Barrajas then took the matter to U.S. District Court, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its director, Kristi Noem, as well as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ and the Omaha Immigration Court.
Attorneys for Barrajas argued he was entitled to a hearing on the question of bond and that, in the alternative, he should be released from custody.
On Sept. 23, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa ordered that such a hearing be scheduled by the immigration court within seven days.
“District courts across the country have addressed arguments similar to – and often identical to – the ones raised here,” Locher wrote in his decision. “The overwhelming majority of these courts have concluded that aliens in the petitioners’ situation are … entitled to bond hearings.”
Locher’s decision was similar to that of many other judges in that while he found that Barrajas was entitled to argue for his release on bond, the issue of whether bond should be granted was for the immigration court, not a U.S. District Court judge, to decide.
“It is not the court’s prerogative to assume the role of the immigration judge by deciding bond or detention,” Locher wrote.
Another recent Iowa case involves Marua Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States, according to her lawyers, to escape some form of persecution. Shortly after coming to the United States, Reyes was given notice to appear in immigration court and was released on her own recognizance.
But on Sept. 2, 2025, while attending her regularly scheduled check-in appointment at the ICE office in Cedar Rapids, ICE officials allegedly canceled her notice to appear in immigration court, entered an order calling for her expedited removal from the country, and had her detained in the Muscatine County Jail.
On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing. A week later, on Oct. 7, 2025, attorneys for Reyes sought an emergency hearing on the matter in U.S. District Court, arguing the immigration court had violated her due process rights by denying her a hearing.
On Tuesday of this week, the Department of Justice sought and obtained a continuance in the case. Judge Locher has given the DOJ until Oct. 21 to file a response in the case.
The Barrajas and Reyes cases are among at least 20 such bond-hearing cases filed recently in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Because the final decisions on bond are still made within the immigration court system, the current status or outcome of the cases is difficult — and in some cases impossible — to track.
Federal judges rule against the DOJ 
Last week, federal judges in the San Francisco area ordered the release of dozens of immigrants held in California detention facilities without a bond hearing. In each case, a U.S. District Court judge had already issued a temporary restraining order or an injunction granting the temporary release of the detainees until the bond-hearing issue could be resolved.
One federal judge in San Francisco, James Donato, recently expressed frustration when a DOJ lawyer argued in court that detainees have no right to a hearing in front of an immigration judge.
“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney. “Just give them a hearing … What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again, and again, and again, in front of every judge in this district?”
Two weeks ago, a U.S. District Court judge in the state of Washington ruled that the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings to detainees was unlawful. That Sept. 30 ruling was made in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in March 2025, challenging the then-new practice of denying bond hearings even to people who have lived in the United States for decades.
Other class-action lawsuits over the same issue, as well as the hundreds of individually filed cases, are still pending in courts throughout the United States.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

The board chair wrote in the complaint that Sen. Scott Beck “used his position and legislative influence to advance a narrative” to push for grade closures that would benefit the private school where he works.

The Danville School District’s board chair filed an ethics complaint on Wednesday against Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, alleging he “used his position and legislative influence to advance a narrative and push” the district to try and close high school grades, a move that would benefit the nearby private school where he works.
Clayton Cargill wrote in his complaint that Beck had warned Cargill and Cabot School District board chair Chris Tormey that the Vermont Legislature was likely to pass legislation to restrict school choice for districts that close their schools.
Beck advised that the two chairs should encourage their boards to move forward with school closure votes before the new year “if we wanted to preserve the option of tuitioning students to independent schools,” Cargill wrote in his complaint. Beck’s warning was first reported by Seven Days.

Neither town was actively considering closing their schools prior to Beck’s advice, Cargill wrote in an email to lawmakers on the Senate Ethics Committee. Beck is an employee of St. Johnsbury Academy, a nearby private school where he works as a social studies teacher.
“Although Senator Beck provided no evidence for his claims, I took them seriously and raised the issue at the Danville School Board meeting on (Sept. 2),” Cargill wrote in the complaint. 
Cargill wrote that Beck texted him several more times after the Sept. 2 meeting, first asking about undecided board members’ votes on school closure, and later texting Cargill that the board “should let the voters have their say. Takes all the pressure off the board.”
According to the complaint, Cargill replied that did not “have the board votes for that just yet but that’s what I’m working on.” Beck replied that it was “difficult to deny democracy.”
In the complaint, Cargill wrote it was “notable” that Beck only reached out to the Danville and Cabot school districts and not Twinfield, which also operates high school grades nearby.
“He contacted only two, and one—Cabot—is not even in his district,” Cargill wrote. “The only clear link between the schools he approached is their proximity to his employer.”
Cargill, in his email to lawmakers, said the private school “stands to benefit financially if these schools close” and that it was “a clear conflict of interest.”
The Caledonia County senator has refuted claims that he had a conflict of interest, and said he was merely offering his opinion to his constituents.
Beck in an interview on Wednesday said that his “job is to represent and to let people know what the facts are and what my opinions are and what I think their possible courses of action are, and that’s what I’ve done here.”
He pointed to specific language that had been in an earlier version of the legislation last session requiring school districts that close a school and designate just three public schools to receive their students.
“Would it have been responsible of me to not tell anybody that someone just made a serious attempt to take away your local control?” he said. “Should I not tell them that, and just ignore it like it never happened? What happens down the road if it actually does happen? … In some ways I feel like I’m caught in the middle here, I’m the messenger, so people aren’t happy about that.”
Regardless, Beck’s advice to the board chairs in Danville and Cabot has created “urgency and confusion in both communities,” Cargill wrote to lawmakers.
The Cabot School District had previously considered circulating a survey to residents about closing their schools and opting for school choice. But Tormey said that the board decided to hold off on the survey “until we find out next year how Cabot School will be placed within the new statewide map.”
Danville, however, is set to hold a vote on Dec. 6 on whether to shutter its high school grades at the Danville School and instead pay tuition for students to attend other schools, following a petition submitted to the board. Public school faculty said closure would have an immense impact on public high school students in the region.
“Both towns have been thrust into the media spotlight and residents in both communities are worried,” he wrote. “We are in danger of closing based on something Scott Beck told people might happen.”
In his email to lawmakers, Cargill said he was told by lawmakers and other public education officials that Beck’s behavior may have violated legislative ethical guidelines.
“I have sought guidance in all the places I know to seek guidance. I’ve beseeched people I treat as mentors. … I was told by many of your colleagues ‘this isn’t right,'” Cargill wrote to lawmakers. “Many of them encouraged me to be steadfast enough to submit this, and as such, I am.”
Beck was previously the focus of a separate ethics complaint filed in June that accused him and Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, of using their positions on a critical committee negotiating the final form of a wide-ranging education bill to advance provisions that benefited the private schools with which they are or have been associated. 
Bongartz and Beck have forcefully denied that accusation.

The “No Kings” rallies are part of a nationwide movement meant to show mass opposition to what protest leaders call Trump’s “authoritarian power grabs.”
Lead Connecticut organizer Jim Chapdelaine says it’s important for those opposed to the administration to see they’re not alone and to take collective action.
“There are powers that be that would prefer we all just stay at our houses and, I don’t know, take up crochet,” Chapdelaine said in a Tuesday interview. “It’s really important to build community and solidarity and unity, [and] especially important to do that in a very peaceful way.”
Chapdelaine said despite the protests’ real stakes, the main rally in Hartford will be “fun.” He said the gathering outside the state Capitol at noon will include live music, puppets and poetry readings.
“I think the way to achieve this peaceful sort of vibe is to make people enjoy things,” he said. “You know, it’s okay to do this kind of work and have fun.”
Performances include singer Nekita Waller, Hartford’s Proud Drill, Drum and Dance Corp, Manchester Poet Laureate Nadia Sims, and Anne Cubberly’s giant puppets “Muchos Colores” and “Mother Earth.”
Chapdelaine rejected claims from leading Republicans in Washington that Saturday’s events were “hate America rallies.”
“We are stressing patriotism. Bring your American flags. Let’s profess our love for America publicly, loudly and peacefully,” he said. “This ‘oh, they hate America’ – no, we love America.”
Addresses by local leaders listed for the Hartford event include Connecticut U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, and Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam.
Among the advocates scheduled to speak are Kica Matos of the National Immigrant Law Group, Bishop John Selders of Moral Monday CT, and Tabitha Sookdeo of CT Students for a Dream.

Ned Lamont is one of 14 governors who intend to share public health information, partly as a rebuke of the Trump administration.","A group of Democratic state governors that includes Gov. Ned Lamont has launched a new alliance aimed at coordinating their public health efforts.
They’re framing it as a way to share data, messages about threats, emergency preparedness and public health policy — and as a rebuke to President Donald Trump’s administration, which they say isn’t doing its job in public health.
“At a time when the federal government is telling the states, ‘you’re on your own,’ governors are banding together,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said in a statement.
“Connecticut is proud to join an alliance that strengthens our collaboration with other states and protects the health and well-being of our residents, while preparing against future threats,” Lamont said in a statement. “Whether it was during the COVID pandemic or any other public health crisis, it’s important for governors to speak with one voice and communicate clearly with our communities to keep them safe. Once again, states are stepping up, amid federal uncertainty, to ensure our residents have the information they need to stay protected.”
The formation of the group touches off a new chapter in a partisan battle over public health measures that has been heightened by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s advisers declining to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations, instead leaving the choice to the individual.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email that Democratic governors who imposed school closures and mask mandates, including for toddlers at the height of the pandemic, are the ones who “destroyed public trust in public health.”
“The Trump Administration and Secretary Kennedy are rebuilding that trust by grounding every policy in rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic,” Nixon said.
The initial members are all Democrats
The Governors Public Health Alliance bills itself as a “nonpartisan coordinating hub,” but the initial members are all Democrats — the governors of 14 states plus Guam.
Among them are governors of the most populous blue states, California and New York, and several governors who are considered possible 2028 presidential candidates, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Illinois’ JB Pritzker.
The idea of banding together for public health isn’t new for Democratic governors. They formed regional groups to address the pandemic during Trump’s first term and launched new ones in recent months amid uncertainty on federal vaccine policy. States have also taken steps to preserve access to COVID-19 vaccines.
The new alliance isn’t intended to supplant those efforts or the coordination already done by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, its organizers say.
A former CDC director is among the advisers
Dr. Mandy Cohen, who was CDC director under former President Joe Biden and before that the head of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, is part of a bipartisan group of advisers to the alliance.
“The CDC did provide an important backstop for expertise and support,” she said. “And I think now with some of that gone, it’s important for states to make sure that they are sharing best practices and that they are coordinating, because the problems have not gone away. The health threats have not gone away.”
Other efforts have also sprung up to fill roles that the CDC performed before the ouster of a director, along with other restructuring and downsizing.

(Photo by Jeff T. Green/Getty Images)Sixteen years after the original deadline, the Hanford nuclear reservation in south-central Washington state is finally converting its worst radioactive waste into a benign glass. 
Glassification began Saturday evening, but the U.S. Department of Energy did not announce that the process was underway until Wednesday.
“As the world’s largest radioactive waste treatment facility, the plant’s successful startup represents a crucial achievement at this scale, demonstrating the ability to stabilize nuclear waste for safe, long-term disposal,” said Ray Geimer, Department of Energy’s Hanford manager.
Lawmakers in Washington’s congressional delegation applauded the milestone.
“This is just the start and we’ve still got a ways to go before we’re anywhere near done, but today’s success is worth celebrating — let’s make glass!” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. 
Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called it an “incredible technical and logistical accomplishment.”
Hanford is expected to take a year to gradually crank up the volume of waste being glassified until the first plant reaches full operation. 
Right now, the plant is processing an initial 25,000-gallon batch of waste. The waste goes through two huge melters that combine it with glass flakes and heat the mixture to 2,100 degrees. This yields melted glass that is poured into huge storage cylinders to cool and harden.
The U.S. government set up Hanford in 1943 to create plutonium for the nation’s atomic bombs. That work created billions of gallons of chemical and radioactive waste. The worst 56 million gallons of the waste were pumped into 177 underground tanks. 
About a third of those tanks leak. At least a million gallons of radioactive liquid have leaked into the ground, seeping into an aquifer 200 feet below and then into the Columbia River, roughly seven miles away.
Hanford began construction of a plant to begin treating the waste in 2002. That plant was originally legally scheduled to go online in 2009 — 16 years ago. 
This first plant is supposed to take care of 40-50% of the tanks’ low-activity wastes. The master plan has been to build two low-activity glassification plants, plus a third to handle 5 million to 6 million gallons of high-level radioactive wastes.

High levels of PFAS have prompted the closure and health warnings for the popular hunting and fishing spot. (Courtesy of  University of New Mexico Communications and Marketing)New Mexico environment officials on Tuesday released a national survey to assess potential exposures to so-called ‘forever chemicals’ at Holloman Lake, which has some of the highest recorded levels on record of toxic PFAS contamination.
All responses to the 10-minute survey will be kept confidential, according to environment officials, who are requesting participation from people over 18 who spent time camping, fishing or boating at the lake.
“Our state’s natural beauty attracts outdoor enthusiasts from around the world and the Environment Department is committed to safeguarding outdoor recreation for campers, hikers, and hunters,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “This survey is one of the first of its kind, aiming to inform New Mexicans and others of potential impacts of PFAS pollution on their health.”
NMED said results from the survey, which will remain open until Nov. 30, will be made public.
Earlier this year, scientists documented record-breaking levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in plant samples and studies of animal carcasses at Holloman Lake.
New Mexico wildlife, plants around Holloman lake have highest PFAS contamination on record

State officials believe the contamination at the man-made chain of wetlands near White Sands National Park stems from neighboring Holloman Air Force Base’s use from the 1970s through 2019 of firefighting foam containing PFAS. This class of chemicals doesn’t easily break down and are difficult to clean up, persisting in water and soils and accumulating in the bodies of humans and animals.
While research is still being conducted on PFAS, federal research has linked PFAS exposure to kidney and reproductive cancers, decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, disruption of immune responses and liver functions in people.
The high levels of PFAS prompted a health advisory in January from the New Mexico Department of Health, requesting that any hunters who ate waterfowl between 2010 and 2024 from Lake Holloman speak to their doctor.
University of New Mexico Biology Professor Chris Witt published research in February 2024 that showed wild ducks had high rates of contamination and were likely unsafe to eat.
He told Source NM in an interview Tuesday that since then, his research is showing consistent high levels in waterfowl.
“That game is undoubtedly really highly contaminated, particularly with PFOS [perfluorooctane sulfonate], which is one of the worst, most persistent and pernicious PFAS substances,” Witt said. “I’m sure that there are people out there, hunters who live in Alamagordo, Otero County, other parts of New Mexico, who maybe should get their blood checked to see how much circulating PFAS they have as a result of that exposure to contaminated wildlife.”
‘Forever chemicals’ detected in Clovis-area blood tests, New Mexico environmental officials say

The site receives treated wastewater from the base, along with campsites and nature trails. The lake is not a source of drinking water for Alamogordo or surrounding communities. But the high levels of PFAS elicited warnings from health officials not to drink or swim in the lake.
The air force closed access to the lake in July, citing potential risks from PFAS exposure. New Mexico is embroiled in two lawsuits with the U.S. military over PFAS contamination on multiple air force bases and how to address clean up.
In January, lawmakers passed specific provisions allowing the state to have explicit powers to treat the chemicals as hazardous waste and require their clean-up and a new law to require explicit labels and create rules to eventually phase out the sale of everyday products containing PFAS.

Free.,Federal judge blocks Trump from carrying out thousands of layoffs during shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-blocks-trump-carrying-out-thousands-layoffs-during-shutdown,,"This report has been updated.WASHINGTON — A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, blocking the Trump administration from moving forward with the thousands of layoffs it initiated after the government shutdown began Oct. 1, as well as any others that officials might want to carry out.  The hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California took place at the same time White House budget director Russ Vought appeared on the conservative Charlie Kirk podcast to preview his next steps.Vought warned the initial Reductions in Force, the technical term for a layoff notice, were just “a snapshot” and that as many as 10,000 federal workers would lose their jobs if the shutdown drags on.“We’re going to keep those RIFs rolling throughout this shutdown because we think it’s important to stay on offense for the American taxpayer and the American people,” Vought said. “We want to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering the bureaucracy, not just the funding, but the bureaucracy.”Judge Susan Illston said during the hearing that she granted the temporary restraining order because Trump administration officials had “taken advantage of the lapse in government spending, government functioning to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don’t apply to them anymore and that they can impose the structures that they like on the government situation that they don’t like.” Illston said laws and regulations still apply during a shutdown and that, by all appearances, the Trump administration's actions in the case are politically motivated. “Things are being done before they’re thought through — very much ready, fire, aim,” Illston said.The ruling will put the approximately 4,000 layoffs noticed during the shutdown on hold as the court case proceeds. DOJ unprepared to speak on merits of caseElizabeth Hedges, a Justice Department attorney arguing the case on behalf of the Trump administration, said several times during the brief hearing she wasn’t prepared to speak about the merits of the case — a position that confounded the judge, who gave Hedges several chances to reverse course.  “We may be able to address the merits at the next stage,” Hedges said, after telling Illston she would need to check with others before making any statements about why the administration believes its actions are legal. Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the labor unions that brought the lawsuit, urged the judge to grant a temporary restraining order for all the departments and agencies that make up the executive branch, not just those that have announced RIFs.Leonard said she believes Trump administration officials have decided how many additional federal employees to lay off during the shutdown, but have opted not to share that information with the court.“The decision has been made, it's just a question of implementation and timing,” Leonard said, around the same time Vought was giving his podcast interview. Illston, who was nominated by former President Bill Clinton, said at the end of the hearing she expected the attorneys to find a day in the coming weeks when they can attend a hearing on the next stage, which would be a preliminary injunction.Senate deadlocks for ninth timeOn the other side of the country, Republicans and Democrats continued to spar on Capitol Hill over the reasons for the shutdown, as the Senate failed for a ninth time to advance a short-term government spending bill. The 51-44 vote was nearly identical to the others that have taken place since mid-September, and neither side appeared inclined to make concessions or even try to negotiate. Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance the bill. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.Democrats maintain there must be a bipartisan deal to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year for people who get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. GOP leaders said they are willing to begin negotiations on that issue, but only after Democrats vote to advance the stopgap bill that would fund government through Nov. 21. The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the legislation in mid-September, but it has remained stalled in the Senate ever since, unable to garner the 60 votes needed to advance toward final passage. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.Congress needs to approve the stopgap bill since it, once again, failed to approve all 12 of the full-year government funding bills by the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year.The only other way to end the funding lapse would be for both chambers to reach a broadly bipartisan consensus on all of those appropriations bills. Layoffs across agenciesThe layoffs initiated by the Trump administration during the shutdown were detailed further on Tuesday in court filings from the labor unions’ attorneys as well as Trump administration officials.  Stephen Billy, senior adviser at the Office of Management and Budget, wrote the number of layoff notices had changed since Friday when he outlined the Reductions in Force to the court.The numbers have fluctuated significantly for some departments, but not for all. Commerce: Approximately 600 employees, up from 315 Education: Remained at 466 employeesHealth and Human Services: 982 employees, down from a range of 1,100 to 1,200 Housing and Urban Development: Stayed at 442 employeesHomeland Security: Decreased to 54 from 176 employeesTreasury: Reduced somewhat to 1,377 employees, from 1,446 Energy, EPA layoffsFederal workers at those departments have 60 days between when the notice was sent and when they will no longer have jobs, though a different standard is in place at the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency. Energy officials, the document says, “issued a general RIF notice informing 179 employees that they may receive a specific notice in the future if it is determined they will be part of any RIF. If so, that notice would provide the relevant notice period.”But a spokesperson for the Energy Department emailed States Newsroom on Tuesday evening to confirm officials had issued RIF notices to workers in the Offices of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Clean Energy Demonstrations, State and Community Energy Programs and Minority Economic Impact.“All these offices played a major role in the Biden administration’s war on American Energy,” the spokesperson wrote. “They oversaw billions of dollars in wasteful spending and massive regulatory overreach, resulting in more expensive and less reliable energy. These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people and a more responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”Further confusing the situation at the Energy Department, a footnote in the court document filed by Billy said that particular agency isn’t actually experiencing a lapse in funding. The Billy court document said EPA officials sent 28 employees “intent to RIF” notices and will send formal RIF notices “to any affected employees at least 60 days prior to the effective date.” A separate document, filed by Thomas J. Nagy Jr., deputy assistant secretary for Human Resources at HHS, said “data discrepancies and processing errors” led to 1,760 employees receiving layoff notices instead of the intended 982.“Employees have been working since October 10, 2025, to rescind the notices that had been issued in error,” Nagy wrote. At CDC, 'eliminating entire offices'Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, wrote in a brief to the court that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “issued RIF notices to approximately 1,300 employees, eliminating entire offices at the agency. Then, within 24 hours, the CDC rescinded approximately 700 of those RIF notices.” Jacobs wrote the 600 CDC workers who received RIFs will officially lose their jobs on Dec. 8, even though they have already lost access to work email and computers. “Many Union members have told me that they are experiencing serious mental health problems and have found it very difficult to get their work done, given all of the turmoil that they have experienced this year,” Jacobs wrote, referencing previous RIF notices and reinstatements. “Members have told me that they worry on a day-to-day basis about whether they will have a job the next day. They said that they have felt like the Trump Administration has been using them as bargaining chips this year.”Jacobs wrote that the Trump administration has decided to lay off many human resources workers, which had blocked other workers who received RIFs from being able to get information about how to roll over their health insurance coverage. During past RIFs, she wrote, workers had “access to the employment records, including paystubs and performance records, that they need for processing their separations,” but cannot since they are locked out of computer systems. Layoffs hit Department of EducationRachel Gittleman, president of AFGE Local 252, which represents nearly 3,000 Education Department workers, wrote in a separate filing the layoffs will impact numerous programs, including civil rights, communications and outreach, elementary and secondary education, post secondary education, and special education and rehabilitative services.“Receiving RIF notices has caused many employees enormous stress. A father of two young boys contacted me—he just moved into a new home and relies on his job to support his family,” Gittleman wrote. “He told me (he) doesn’t know what he will do next.”Workers on maternity or disability leave also received layoff notices, “forcing them to job-hunt and face financial insecurity while managing newborns or health conditions,” she wrote. Following past RIF notices, the department provided “career transitioning and counseling, benefits and retirement training, and access to other human resources and employee assistance programs.” But Gittleman wrote that isn’t happening this time. ‘Devastated’ HUD employeesAshaki Robinson, regional vice president for AFGE Council 222, which represents nearly 5,000 HUD workers, said the layoff notices for that department will impact employees in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, Puerto Rico, Texas and Washington, D.C., who manage a variety of programs. “They are devastated that the RIF is happening and are very concerned about losing their incomes, health insurance coverage for themselves and dependents, and other employment benefits in 60 days, when they will be separated from employment,” Robinson wrote. The hundreds of HUD workers who have received RIF notices, she wrote, were “targeted for termination not because of anything they did themselves, but because of decisions made by elected officials that may have been driven by politics.”",,,,2025-10-15 17:02:58.904641

“I am deeply grateful to be reunited with my family and community,” Zia, whose full name is not being used due to concerns about his safety, said in a press release. “I came to this country because I believed America would protect me and my family after I had proudly served alongside American troops in Afghanistan. I still believe in America, and I want to continue rebuilding my life here and contribute to the community that has welcomed me.”
Zia, who came to the country through legal means, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on July 16 in East Hartford following a routine appointment with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. He was held at a Massachusetts detention facility in Plymouth.
Zia’s detainment was decried by lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and U.S. Rep. Bill Keating of Massachusetts, who visited the detention facility where he was held in July to draw attention to the issue.
“For masked agents to snatch someone off the street with no warning, no counsel, no opportunity even to know who is doing it while it’s in process, is unAmerican,” Blumenthal said during a press conference after the July visit. “He actually worked and risked his life in Afghanistan to uphold the values and rights that are central to democracy. And for now, him to be, in effect, violated in his rights when he has fought for those rights here is completely disgraceful.”
Initially Zia was denied a bond hearing by an immigration judge, but attorney Lauren Cundick Petersen said that a different judge granted such a hearing. It took place on Tuesday, and the judge found that Zia met the criteria to be released on bond. Zia is still subject to ongoing immigration proceedings to resolve his immigration status and whether he will be allowed to remain in the U.S. permanently.
Petersen said her client was approved for humanitarian parole in 2024 due to direct Taliban threats that put his life in imminent danger. He came to the U.S. with his wife and children in October 2024. Since his arrival, Petersen said that Zia has found full-time work and continued on with the legal process of filing an application for a green card.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/zia-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-15 15:03:37.332541

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo/Gage Skidmore)Newark Mayor Ras Baraka this week urged a federal court to allow his false arrest and malicious prosecution lawsuit to continue in response to federal prosecutors’ arguments that federal doctrine shields acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba from the suit.
Prosecutors’ claims that Habba and a Department of Homeland Security investigator also named in the suit are entitled to qualified and absolute immunity is “breathtaking in its presumption that these actions can escape any accountability by the third branch of government,” Yael Bromberg, Baraka’s attorney, wrote to the judge overseeing the case on Tuesday.
“The Defendants are liable for violating constitutional rights,” Bromberg’s letter reads.
New videos capture tense moments surrounding arrest of Newark mayor

Baraka, a Democrat, in June sued Habba and Ricky Patel, the investigator, alleging they violated his constitutional rights after arresting him for trespassing at a Newark immigrant detention facility on May 9, only to drop the charge less than two weeks later, earning admonishment from the federal judge overseeing his case. Baraka said he was at the jail to inspect it with city officials.
Baraka’s attorneys argue the charges were dropped because federal authorities were aware the mayor committed no crime. Patel is seen on police body camera footage taken just prior to Baraka’s arrest saying that he was detaining the mayor “per the deputy attorney general of the United States.”
“Claims of malicious prosecution must show that the proceedings were initiated ‘without probable cause’ and that the defendants ‘acted maliciously for a purpose other than bringing the plaintiff to justice,’” Bromberg wrote, citing a 2017 appeals court decision. “Those circumstances are immediately present here.”
The police body camera footage, released as part of a separate federal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10), shows a staffer from Geo Group, the migrant jail’s operator, allowing Baraka into a fenced area of the facility, where he remained for roughly 40 minutes before complying with agents’ requests to exit the premises.
McIver, who was later charged with assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest, has said the case against her is purely political. Habba announced the charges against McIver at the same time she said she was dropping the case against Baraka.
Attorneys for Habba and Patel in a September letter signaled they would ask the judge to dismiss Baraka’s lawsuit, arguing he had failed to exhaust administrative remedies through complaints to the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and should have filed a claim under the Federal Tort Claim Act.
Baraka’s suit does not cite that law. His claims of defamation and false light are state torts that his attorneys argue are controlled by state law, not federal. Habba in television appearances and on social media claimed Baraka stormed the facility alongside a mob of protestors (surveillance video footage shows protestors remained outside the facility’s gates).
Attorneys for Habba and Patel also argued they are protected from civil liability by the doctrines of qualified and absolute immunity, which shield officials from civil liabilities in such cases, and said the United States, which enjoys broader civil immunity under federal law, should replace Habba and Patel as Baraka’s defendant.
Habba’s tenure as U.S. attorney has been turbulent. A federal judge in August ruled she no longer has any legal authority because her temporary appointment ended in July, while the Trump administration argues that it made a series of personnel moves that will keep her in the job for roughly another six months. That case is expected to go before the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating roughly 5,000 gallons of hog manure spilled in Carroll County. 
The manure, from a hog confinement site, was being applied to a field Monday evening when a leak occurred in a hose and caused the manure to flow onto the field and into an unnamed tributary of Elk Run Creek. 
Kaitlynne Henriksen, an environmental specialist with DNR, said the B&B Custom Pumping team, the manure applicators, “responded very quickly” to the leak and placed dams in the creek that stopped the manure from traveling downstream.

Henriksen said the tributary was relatively dry when the spill occurred which meant the field application team was able to put dams in place before the manure traveled too far. 
Henriksen said the water downstream of the dam appeared clear and she observed swimming fish. DNR is waiting for results from the State Hygienic Laboratory to ensure samples taken below the dam don’t show signs of pollutants. As of Wednesday, Henriksen said no dead fish had been observed. 
The applicator company continues to pump water from the creek to ensure it is clean before removing any of the dams, according to Henriksen. 
She said the crew’s pump shut off automatically when it detected the leak in the hose, but the manure already in the hoses spilled onto the field. Henriksen said it was “unfortunate” that the leak occurred while the team was uphill from the creek. 
“They were really great at responding right away and they did as much as they could, given the situation,” Henriksen said. 
According to a news release from DNR, the incident remains under investigation as the department determines whether further enforcement action is needed.

In June, the event drew approximately 42,000 people to rallies across the state in opposition to President Donald Trump, coinciding with a Washington, D.C., military parade. Millions more attended across the nation. 
Now, the organizers of the No Kings protest, a movement called 50501, are calling for Vermonters to show up to protests Oct. 18 in opposition to Trump’s targeting of immigrants, the government shutdown and more, according to its website. More than 40 different protests, marches and rallies are planned.

Burlington’s June protest had an estimated 16,000 attendees — making it the largest in the state — and cost an estimated $20,000 for permits, security and more. This Saturday, Burlington organizers plan to host several different rallies scattered throughout the city, including three different marches, a bike ride, and a honk and wave. 
It’s unclear if any pro-Trump protests are planned. The Vermont Republican Party, which hosted a pro-Trump party during the June protests, has not posted any events for this Saturday on its website.

The clerks cited concerns about timeliness of the certification of elections, confusion by voters and delays to any recounts or audits in their opposition to the measure. 
“Michigan voters are used to knowing who won an election in a timely manner, so it’s incredibly important that we’re able to report accurate, unofficial results on election night,” said Kent County Clerk Lisa Posthumus Lyons in a press release from the association. “Determining a winner will take drastically longer under ranked-choice voting. Delayed results erode the public’s trust by fueling uncertainty and misinformation.”
Marquette County Clerk Linda Talsma, who chairs the association, also noted in the release that while they do not generally take positions on ballot measures, the bipartisan group of county officials felt it necessary to urge voters to reject the initiative in this case. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Michigan voters already face some of the longest and most complex ballots in the nation, covering federal, state, county, city, township, school, and special district contests on a single ballot,” reads the official resolution passed by the clerks’ association. “The RankMIVote proposal would further complicate ballots by requiring voters to numerically rank candidates in certain contests while others remain unchanged, adding inconsistency, voter confusion, and voter fatigue.”
The resolution also cited a survey, conducted in June by The Glengariff Group, in which 65% of Michigan voters polled — across demographic and political lines — opposed the implementation of ranked choice voting. 
But proponents of the initiative pushed back against these criticisms. A statement from Rank MI Vote in response to the clerks’ statement cited that “upwards of 96% of voters found their ballot simple to complete,” adding that “79% of jurisdictions using RCV release results within 24 hours of an election.”
“Ranked Choice Voting has been proven to increase both the demographic diversity and diversity of ideas in the candidates who run and win elections,” said Joe Spaulding, the campaign director for Rank MI Vote, in the release.

Spaulding also criticized the timing of the announcement, which came on the same day as the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case that could undercut a key clause of the Voting Rights Act. 
“If we set election policy based on the misplaced notion that voters are confused by having more choices instead of the fact that voters are angry when they have fewer choices, turnout will decline,” he added. “This is an outcome we know clerks want to avoid.”
One additional concern raised by the clerks is a potential constitutional conflict with straight-party voting, which Rank MI Vote says would not be affected by the inclusion of ranked choice voting, nor would the primary system in place. 
The proposal put forth by Rank MI Vote would establish the new voting system in federal elections for President, Senate and House of Representatives, as well as state elections for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General and Secretary of State, starting in 2029. 
Five Michigan municipalities — Ann Arbor, East Lansing, Ferndale, Kalamazoo and Royal Oak — have individually passed ranked choice voting measures. But none have been able to put them into practice due to conflicts with current Michigan election laws. 
Ranked choice voting is already being used in a number of states and cities around the United States — Maine and Alaska have both adopted the practice for certain elections including the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, and cities like New York City, San Francisco and Minneapolis have begun to use it for some citywide elections. 
While this ballot initiative continues, Republicans in Michigan’s Legislature have also considered banning ranked choice voting in the state outright, passing a bill through the House in August along party lines that would do just that. 
As of March 2025, Ballotpedia reported that 13 states had enacted legislation banning ranked choice voting, and another five failed in 2024 to pass ballot measures that would have put the system in place.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)The Kanawha County judge presiding over a lawsuit regarding the state’s compulsory school vaccination law and religious freedom said he’s not sure whether a Raleigh County judge has authority to certify a class made up of plaintiffs with similar cases there and around the state. 
Judge Richard Lindsay said the only context he knows for class certification are cases when plaintiffs have been injured.
“Is there a difference between that and what we have before us in these cases, wherein the issue is one of law, not of injury?” Lindsay asked Corey Palumbo, an attorney representing the Kanawha County Board of Education. “Is that a distinction that can be made between what my understanding of… certification of classes, versus what we have here?
“Effectively the plaintiff here is claiming some type of injury, but it’s not a determination of whether one party was negligent or whether or not a specific physical injury was sustained,” he said. “Here we have basically a question of law as to whether or not the compulsory vaccination law applies.”
Wednesday’s hearing was in the case of Nakesha Watson vs. the Kanawha County Board of Education. Watson filed the complaint on behalf of KJ, III, her child. According to the suit, the state Bureau for Public Health granted KJ a religious exemption to the school vaccine requirements, but the school board is not letting him attend school with the exemption. 
Watson, who is representing herself in court, was a no-show for the hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday. She had filed motions for a temporary injunction in the case and for emergency review of the case. Lindsay rescheduled the hearing for later this week.
By that time, Palumbo noted, Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble is expected to have entered a written order certifying a class that may include Watson in a similar case Froble is overseeing. 
In the Raleigh County case, families are suing the state and Raleigh County school boards to make them allow their students to attend school with a religious exemption to the school vaccination requirements. 
West Virginia law has allowed only medical exemptions to those requirements. Gov. Patrick Morrisey earlier this year issued an executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to the law, citing a 2023 religious freedom law. He’s not rescinded the order, even though the state Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have put the religious exemptions in state law. The state school board directed county school boards not to recognize religious and philosophical exemptions. 
Froble has already granted a preliminary injunction in that case. During a permanent injunction hearing last week in Beckley, Froble said he would certify a class to include anyone who has asked the state Department of Health for a religious or philosophical exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. As of last week, the state Department of Health had granted about 575 nonmedical exemptions. Froble is expected to make a ruling on permanent injunction in the case by the end of November.
Defendants in the Raleigh County case — the state and Raleigh school boards— opposed the class certification, Palumbo noted.
“The defendants in that case did not believe that that was proper and objected to that decision,” he said. “The judge is doing it anyway, obviously. [He] has not entered an order yet, but again, we expect that order to be entered from what the judge said by the end of this week.”
Lindsay said as he understands the state’s legal system, West Virginia circuit courts operate similarly to the federal judiciary. One federal appeals court may decide one way and another may reach a different ruling, but ultimately the federal Supreme Court decides the issue, Lindsay said.
“I would think that these cases, just without knowing anymore, and I’m more than happy to research it more, but it would follow that type of pattern,” Lindsay said. “So ultimately, the Supreme Court can decide this issue as to whether or not the [compulsory vaccination law] applies, whether or not the state has a compelling interest with regard to vaccination of children.”
The hearing in the Kanawha case is now set for 9 a.m. Friday.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Airports in multiple states, including South Dakota, are not airing a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames the ongoing federal government shutdown on Democrats.
The video was promoted by the White House as being played at “every public airport in America.”
In South Dakota, a spokesperson for Rapid City Regional Airport said Wednesday it was not airing the video because the airport’s administration has not instructed staff do so. At Sioux Falls Regional Airport, Executive Director Dan Letellier said the video is not airing because the airport does not have monitors appropriate for the purpose. He said existing monitors are devoted to flight-related information.
Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport both confirmed to Arizona Mirror that they are not displaying the video.
Airport spokesman Ryan Smith said the video is not currently displayed at the airport due to the Mesa Gateway Airport Authority Board policy, which states that “(a)dvertising that discusses the topics or subjects of politics or religion, social society, or economics is prohibited.”

“Consistent with airport policy, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport declined to post the video,” Jon Brodsky, a spokesman for the state’s largest airport, said. Sky Harbor also has a policy that does not permit political content.
The Michigan Advance reports that spokespeople for both the Flint Bishop International Airport and Grand Rapids’ Gerald R. Ford International Airport confirmed Monday afternoon that they have not been playing the video.
Heidi Groenboom, communications and events associate for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority said that as of Monday afternoon, they had not received the video and that it was not playing at the airport.
New Jersey Monitor reports that the region’s three largest airports will not air the video, saying not only does it violate a ban on political advertising but it also violates the federal Hatch Act, which prohibits federal workers from engaging in politics on the clock.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate agency that oversees Newark Liberty, LaGuardia and JFK airports, said airport-controlled screens will not play Noem’s video.
The 30-second spot violates the Port Authority’s longstanding policies that “prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
In the video, Noem — who formerly served as governor of South Dakota — said “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government” while acknowledging the shutdown has affected operations, with many TSA employees working without pay.
“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” Noem said.

The shutdown now has continued for 15 days.  “She won her election after the House was out of session,” said Johnson, who has kept the House out while the shutdown extends. “That hasn't been scheduled because we haven't had that session yet. As soon as (Sen.) Chuck Schumer opens the government…we'll have that as soon as we get back to business.” Epstein petitionJohnson has previously sworn in three members when the House was not in session — two Republicans and one Democrat. But Democrats charge that Johnson is holding off on swearing in Grijalva because she would give Democrats and a handful of Republicans the final vote to compel the Department of Justice to release documents regarding the late sex offender and wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein, who frequently socialized with the president. Republicans control the House by a slim 219-213 majority.“Speaker Johnson knows that I will be the 218th signature on the discharge petition,” Grijalva said, referring to a bipartisan petition to force a vote on the measure. “He is doing everything in his power to shield this administration from accountability.” Democrats earlier this month tried to get recognition during the House pro forma session to swear in Grijalva, but Republicans presiding over the chamber ignored those efforts. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has also threatened Johnson with legal action if Grijalva is not sworn in.The chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York, said Democrats are “looking at all possible options.”“But we are demanding from Speaker Johnson to seat her immediately so that the folks that she represents, the people that she represents, continue to get the services that they deserve to get,” he said.Senators from Arizona speak outArizona’s Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego said they have pressed for Johnson to swear in Grijalva and have demanded answers. Kelly, who lives in Grijalva’s district, said those constituents don’t have representation in Congress.“And that is wrong,” he said.Gallego was blunt about the reason for Grijalva’s delay.“Speaker Johnson is protecting pedophiles,” he said. “He has one more day to protect all those pedophiles, whether it's involving Donald Trump or any of his rich, elite friends.”Last month, through a subpoena, House Democrats revealed a lewd image and inscription they alleged was a birthday note that President Donald Trump provided for Epstein’s 50th-birthday book compiled by the financier’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.The subpoena stems from records in the government’s 2019 federal sex trafficking case against Epstein, which was brought to light after a year-long investigation by the Miami Herald that tracked down more than 60 women, most of whom were underage at the time, who detailed their sexual abuse.",,,,2025-10-15 13:57:30.893703

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)The United States Agriculture Department informed states including New Mexico that it will not pay for food stamps in November if the ongoing government shutdown continues, the state’s Health Care Authority secretary said Wednesday
The order could mean the state’s 450,000 recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program won’t receive nearly $90 million in benefits next month, HCA Secretary Kari Armijo told lawmakers on the Legislative Finance Committee during a meeting Wednesday morning in Santa Fe.
In addition, Armijo said the USDA informed states it may revoke the authorization of the state’s roughly 1,700 SNAP retailers, “so folks with SNAP benefits on their cards would not be able to access those benefits starting in November,” she said.
Armijo said the USDA informed states including New Mexico about the change Friday, Oct. 10, prompting the HCA to prepare for the impact. Roughly one of every five New Mexicans receive SNAP benefits, giving it the highest rate of SNAP reliance in the country.
Five things to know about federal food assistance cuts before the special session

“We are prepared to, if the shutdown comes to an end in the next couple of weeks, really act quickly and make sure that folks get those benefits as timely as possible in November,” she said. 
“But as of right now, it’s looking like those benefits will be delayed,” she said. 
The USDA also recently announced it was transferring funds into the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — known as WIC—to keep it running through October.
The HCA is alerting food banks about the abrupt termination of benefits, Armijo said, in anticipation of increased demand at food bank lines. The authority is also trying to expedite the delivery of roughly $8 million in funding for food banks lawmakers approved in the special legislative session earlier this month. 
The Authority is also preparing notices to SNAP recipients, she said, and it is trying to identify other sources for food and donations. 
An HCA spokesperson provided Source New Mexico with the one-page letter the USDA sent states on Oct. 10. It cites the ongoing federal government shutdown and says, “If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation.”
The letter goes on to instruct states not to submit client files to statewide SNAP vendors they’d need to approve SNAP purchases in November, “in the interest of preserving maximum flexibility.”
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

LFC Director Charles Sallee told lawmakers earlier Wednesday that his agency heard about the change Tuesday and was seeking clarity about why administrators for SNAP, a permanent program typically unaffected in a federal shutdown, would be claiming the program has no funding. 
“We’re following up with HCA as well as other folks to verify whether food stamps is really out of money or if this is just a tactic that the administration is playing in the overall negotiation,” he said. 
The HCA is also seeking clarity from the USDA about whether funds the state receives to administer SNAP will also be cut or delayed. 
The possible revocation of SNAP retailer authorization would render other legislative funding during the Oct. 1 special session moot, Armijo said. Lawmakers approved $16.6 million to maintain SNAP benefits ahead of federal cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
“So all of the investments that we’ve made in terms of those state funded supplements also would not be able to be utilized,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snapposter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s new education chief said Wednesday he has “no plans to distribute Bibles” or a biblical curriculum in public schools, reversing course from his predecessor, Ryan Walters.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields, who was appointed to the position this month, indicated Wednesday he will not fight in court to defend Walters’ order that Oklahoma public schools teach from the Bible and keep a copy of it in every classroom. 
A lawsuit, which 32 Oklahomans filed with the state Supreme Court last year, challenged the mandate and Walters’ attempt to purchase 55,000 Bibles and a biblical curriculum through a public bidding process.
“We plan to file a motion to dismiss, and have no plans to distribute Bibles or a biblical character education curriculum in classrooms,” Fields announced in a statement Wednesday. “If resources are left to be allocated, the timing is fortunate since the team and I are currently reviewing the (Oklahoma State Department of Education) budget.”
The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday gave Fields until Oct. 28 to decide whether to resolve the lawsuit by withdrawing the Bible directives. 
Represented by local and national legal groups, 32 parents, students, educators and faith leaders sued Walters, the Education Department, the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, which oversees bidding and purchasing for state agencies.

Requiring biblical instruction in public schools and purchasing Bibles with taxpayer dollars violates the Oklahoma Constitution’s ban on state-established religion, they contend.
The Supreme Court acknowledged there’s been “significant turnover” of the public officials involved in the case. Walters resigned from office Sept. 30 to lead a conservative nonprofit, and Gov. Kevin Stitt has replaced every member of the state Board of Education since the lawsuit was filed in October 2024. The head of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, Rick Rose, also recently resigned.
Fields became the lead defendant in the case when Stitt appointed him to finish Walters’ term as state superintendent.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs are working with the Education Department to determine what, if any, impact the change in public officers will have on the case, said Megan Lambert, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit.
Lambert declined to comment on Fields’ announcement Wednesday because nothing has been filed yet in court.
The state Supreme Court hasn’t reached a final decision in the lawsuit, but it agreed in March to block the Education Department from purchasing Bibles and a biblical curriculum while the case is pending.
Walters’ administration already purchased more than 500 Bibles to give to Advanced Placement government classes.
In a separate case, the Court temporarily barred the implementation of Walters’ new academic standards for social studies courses that would have required public schools to teach Bible stories and the teachings of Jesus.
Walters said this instruction would help contextualize the beliefs of America’s founding fathers and key historical figures. He also called the separation of church and state a myth.

Mike Kehoe, center, speaks to reporters about the Missouri redistricting plan Sept. 25 during a visit to Columbia Regional Airport (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).A filing in one of the many lawsuits challenging Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting plan appears to cast uncertainty on Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe’s statements that the map was prepared by staff in his office.
A lawsuit filed by the committee seeking to force a referendum on the map states: “Governor Kehoe prepared and provided to the General Assembly the new congressional districts and accompanying map.”
In an answer filed Tuesday, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office wrote: “State Defendant admits that various governmental actors participated in the State’s 2025 congressional reapportionment. To the extent further response is required, State Defendant denies the allegations…”
The lawsuit was filed by a political action committee called Politicians Not People against Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins after he rejected three proposed referendum petitions because they were filed before Kehoe signed the bill.  The answer also denies that Hoskins made any error and asserts that People not Politicians filed suit in the wrong court and against the wrong defendant.
Missouri Democrats have publicly questioned the governor’s public statements that his office crafted the new map, arguing instead that it most likely came from President Donald Trump’s White House.

The phrasing used by the state’s attorneys is revealing, state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Democrat from Kansas City, said in an interview with The Independent.
“I am not surprised at all to see the attorney general use this language,” she said. “Obviously now we are entering the court of law and facts matter.”
All along, Nurrenbern said, she has been convinced “this map was just a copy and paste from Washington, D.C.” 
Discovering the map’s author has been frustrating, she said, and it was never adequately answered during the special session. Lawmakers were not fully trained on mapping software, she said, and no map was produced by legislative staff.
“The day that the governor called the extraordinary session, the map was already done,” Nurrenbern said, “and so that’s why I could say with absolute certainty that this map was not drawn in the state.”
Throughout the special session and after, Kehoe’s office has been adamant that it was done by the governor’s staff without assistance from Washington.
Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing People Not Politicians in its lawsuit, said he was surprised by the state’s response. It could mean, he said, that Kehoe didn’t personally make the map. But he said “various governmental actors” is certainly broad enough to include federal employees at the White House.
 “Why are people embarrassed about taking credit for this bill?” Hatfield said. 
Hanaway’s office did not respond immediately to requests for clarification. A spokeswoman for the governor’s office said Tuesday that the original filing “does not specifically say ‘Governor Kehoe’s office’” prepared and provided the map.
On Wednesday morning, Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green set the case for a trial on Nov. 4. Green is being asked to decide whether a referendum can be launched as soon as lawmakers take the final vote on a bill or if petitioners must wait until a bill is signed.
In a news release Wednesday, Hoskins said he had approved a new version of the referendum petition and that signature gathering could begin. Any signatures already gathered, Hoskins said, are not valid and gathering them before his approval of the petition form is a misdemeanor.
People Not Politicians said last week that it had collected more than 50,000 signatures from registered voters. The campaign needs at least 106,384 signatures spread over six of the state’s eight congressional districts to put it on a ballot.
The referendum campaign has until Dec. 11 to turn in signatures.
Nurrenbern said she has personally been collecting signatures to put the new map on the ballot next year. She sees Hoskins’ warning about signatures gathered before his approval as a personal threat that she may be prosecuted.
“It is incredibly frustrating that we have a secretary of state using the office to intimidate voters and threaten democracy,” Nurrenbern said.
The new Missouri map targets the Kansas-City based 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, with the goal of winning seven of Missouri’s congressional seats for the GOP.
Lawmakers approved the new map after Trump started pressuring Misouri Republicans in July to redraw the districts. A special session in Texas was preparing to revise that state’s 34 districts to provide as many as five new safe GOP districts. In retaliation, California lawmakers put a new district map on that state’s ballot with the aim to shift five seats to Democrats. 
Court battle looms over KC precinct listed twice in Missouri’s new congressional map

In a lawsuit currently underway in Texas, Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, testified Oct. 7 that he prepared the map passed by the Texas legislature.
According to records obtained by The Independent, Kincaid produced a memo used by the map’s legislative sponsor in Missouri explaining the details of the new districts. In a September interview with The Independent, he insisted that is not evidence that he had a hand in creating the map.
In an interview Tuesday, Kincaid said he would not discuss whether he had a role in the Missouri map.
“I am going to defer to the governor’s office and the AG’s office on that,” he said.
Along with the lawsuit over referendum rules, there are four other lawsuits in various stages where opponents of the new map seek to have it declared unconstitutional. One, filed by the NAACP of Missouri, argues Kehoe had no authority to call lawmakers into special session and have all actions of the special session declared void.
The case was argued Sept. 15 before Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh, who has yet to make a ruling.
There is one other case in Cole County that directly challenges the redistricting plan and two more filed in Jackson County.
The Cole County case is set for a trial on Nov. 12, also before Limbaugh. In the lawsuit, which also has Hatfield as the lead attorney, the plaintiffs argue the Missouri Constitution only allows redistricting to occur immediately after the state receives a new census report.
“All we’ve got to do is look at the Constitution, take a look and see whether they can do redistricting,” Hatfield said. “The answer to that is no, they can’t do it at all.”
The Jackson County cases are not scheduled for trial. One includes accusations that the map approved by lawmakers is flawed and therefore not valid because it uses the same precinct in two different districts.
The other, filed the day Kehoe signed the bill, includes the argument that no authority exists in the Constitution allowing lawmakers to revise congressional districts in the absence of new census data.

(Getty Images)While New Mexico made progress in 2024 battling syphilis and congenital syphilis, the state’s primary and secondary syphilis rates remain twice the national average. As such, the state Department of Health on Wednesday announced a renewal of a 2022 public health order with “aggressive testing requirements” to sustain the state’s progress “and protect newborns from preventable deaths,” a news release said.
Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, becomes congenital syphilis when it passes from mother to child. Congenital syphilis can cause birth defects, along with fetal or infant death. In 2023, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranked New Mexico second-highest in the nation for both congenital syphilis and primary/secondary syphilis. According to data in the public health order, that year New Mexico had a congenital syphilis rate of 422.9 per 100,000 live births, which represented an 874% increase from 2018.
Last year, New Mexico’s primary and secondary syphilis rates dropped 31%, while its congenital syphilis rates decreased 19.6%, NMDOH said. Those decreases represented the state’s first decline in syphilis rates since 2018. Nonetheless, the state’s primary and secondary syphilis rates remain twice the national average.
The public health order directs medical professionals to continue syphilis testing for all individuals aged 18 to 50 across New Mexico; to test pregnant individuals during the first and third trimester and at delivery; and syphilis testing for all pregnant people at correctional facilities, among other provisions.
“Congenital syphilis is entirely preventable, so our continued focus on testing and treatment is saving babies’ lives and protecting families,” Janine Waters, NMDOH sexually transmitted disease program manager, said in a statement. “This public health order targets interventions to reverse one of the most challenging public health threats.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pregnancyultrasound-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

For decades, the 59-year-old has pursued appeals across state and federal courts challenging his death sentence as well as a separate aggravated assault and rape case. As of midday Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court had not announced whether it would hear Crawford’s case and stay the execution. 
Crawford was convicted of capital murder in 1994 for taking 20-year-old Kristie Ray from her family’s Tippah County home to a wooden cabin where he handcuffed and raped her and stabbed her in the chest. 
As of this year, 37 executions have been carried out around the country, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Crawford’s planned execution will be the third in the U.S. this week, following Tuesday executions in Florida and Missouri. Six more are scheduled through the end of the year. 
Ray’s mother, Mary Ray, told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal after years of waiting, she is glad that Crawford’s execution will happen. 
“We are not vengeful people; we just want justice for our daughter,” she said.
Over the years and the days leading up to the execution, her mother, family and friends shared pictures of Kristie on social media and set them as their Facebook profile pictures. 
On Monday, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves denied Crawford clemency because of the nature of the crime and because he had never claimed innocence. This execution will be the fourth Reeves has declined to block since he’s been in office: one in 2021, another in 2022 and the last in June of this year. 
“Mississippi is praying for Ms. Ray and her family,” Reeves said in a Monday statement. “Justice must be served on behalf of victims. In Mississippi, it will be.”
At the time of the killing, Crawford was out on bond and days away from another trial for the rape of a teenage girl and assault of another one in the same county. Members of his family and a former attorney testified how they contacted law enforcement because they feared Crawford was committing another crime, which led to his arrest in Ray’s death.

Crawford has said he didn’t remember the killing and that he experienced blackouts. But after his arrest, he showed law enforcement where to find Ray’s body. He said he experienced similar blackouts for the earlier assault and rape. 
In a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, Crawford’s attorneys argued his trial attorney conceded his guilt to the jury and told jurors during the closing arguments that he was “legally responsible” for the crimes and “still dangerous to the community.” 
They argued it was a Sixth Amendment violation of the accused’s right to defense because the attorneys made the concessions against Crawford’s repeated objections, according to court records. 
After the nation’s high court declined to take up his case in 2014, the Mississippi attorney general’s office asked the state Supreme Court to set an execution. But the justices did not set one because Crawford was appealing his rape conviction, which prosecutors considered an aggravating factor when pursuing the death penalty. 
In post-conviction motions, he argued that reversing the conviction would invalidate his death sentence and require him to be resentenced. 
Crawford has been part of a few lawsuits challenging the use of certain drugs in executions. The most recent and ongoing lawsuit filed in July of this year is a federal class action with four other death row inmates challenging the Mississippi Department of Correction’s three-drug lethal injection protocol. 
In a separate federal lawsuit challenging the drugs used in Mississippi, U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate allowed the executions of two of the plaintiffs to proceed: that of Richard Jordan and Thomas Loden. 
Starting Wednesday afternoon in the hour before the execution, death penalty opponents plan to stand in front of the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson and some will demonstrate outside the main gate of Parchman. 
Anti-death penalty organizations circulated petitions against Crawford’s execution that together have received over 1,000 signatures. Death Penalty Action’s petition was delivered to the governor’s office Tuesday. 
Last week, Mississippi prison reform advocate Mitzi Magleby and the Rev. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser to death row prisoners, spoke out in front of the Mississippi Supreme Court to call on Gov. Reeves and the state to stop pursuing executions, which they said are part of a system built on vengeance. 
They said Crawford should be held accountable for Ray’s death, but that can be done by having him serve life without parole. Both have spoken with Crawford and said they have found a changed man who works a prison job and has stayed out of trouble during his incarceration. 
“We are not God,” Magleby said about carrying out death sentences. “Mississippi is not God. We are humans who are not supposed to kill other human beings … The death of Charles Crawford will do nothing to heal anyone. It will do nothing to make the state of Missisisppi any safer than it is now.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081403/AP060710014048.jpg,,,2025-10-15 13:02:29.615761

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)In a clear rebuke of recent federal health policy, 15 Democratic governors announced today they’ve formed a public health alliance that breaks with guidance from the Trump administration and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
It’s the largest move by states to diverge from recent policy decisions under Kennedy that have alarmed medical and public health experts, from federal funding cuts for health services to changes to vaccine guidance.
The participating governors are from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam.
Blue states hold on to public health dollars while red states lose out

“This alliance is a commitment to transparency, preparedness, and coordination so that no state faces health threats alone,” Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer said in a statement.
“By working together, governors can share data, resources, and lessons learned to strengthen our preparedness for the next public health challenge.”
The new Governors Public Health Alliance is intended to strengthen collaboration among the states in emergency preparedness and communication, to help them share data and expertise, and to improve response times to health threats. Although the participating governors are all Democrats, they’re billing the coalition as nonpartisan.
The new alliance comes on the heels of previous regional coordination efforts such as the West Coast Health Alliance between California, Oregon and Washington.
In recent months, at least 17 states have sidestepped federal guidance and promoted broader access to the COVID-19 vaccine. Those moves came in the wake of new COVID-19 vaccine guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, both under the leadership of Kennedy, a well-known vaccine skeptic.
“As extremists try to weaponize the CDC and spread misinformation, we’re stepping up to coordinate across states, protect communities and ensure decisions are driven by data, facts, and the health of the American people,” California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
Meanwhile, major professional societies such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have released their own guidance that diverges from federal policy on a number of issues, from vaccines to autism.
The new Governors Public Health Alliance will be supported by the nonprofit Governors Action Alliance, or GovAct, an initiative overseen by a group of former governors that include both Republicans and Democrats.

Sept. 17, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceMichigan’s Department of Health and Human Services was given the green light by the Court of Claims to go forward with a competitive bidding process for the state’s prepaid inpatient mental health plan providers and a plan to reduce the number of regions for those plans, which ensure access to mental health services for Medicaid beneficiaries, from 10 to three. 
In a set of two opinions issued on Tuesday, Court of Claims Judge Christopher Yates denied a preliminary injunction to a set of those service managers and providers that would have prevented the department from continuing the bidding process for the selection of those prepaid inpatient health plans in three regions across the state. 
The decision “seems unwise given the history of those existing PIHPs with the program and their strong connections with CMHSPs and providers,” Yates wrote in the first order issued. “But assessing the wisdom of such changes is a matter of policy reserved for the MDHHS, not the courts.”
That order stated that the department’s plan to restructure the prepaid unpaid health plan to a competitive system is “not only compatible with state law, but also regarded as the preferred nationwide model.”
The change had previously drawn heavy criticism from mental health advocates, who said that it would lead to increased privatization of the system. 
Former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing), said in September, “We’re talking about a proposal that would replace a managed care system that is transparent and cost about 2% for a private managed system that is not transparent and will cost more like 15% tell me about the math on that one, resulting in $500 million in additional [overhead] costs.”

And in August, CEO of the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan Robert Sheehan wrote in a press release praising the lawsuit, saying it “illegally eliminates the public managed care organization … entrusted with managing the care for some of the most vulnerable and resilient members of our communities.”
The Community Mental Health Association declined to comment on the recent court orders. 
The providers filing suit claimed that, because the new structure would require each provider to cover an entire region of the three — and these existing providers had previously only covered one region of 10 — it would essentially force them out of business. 
Yates did not dispute this, but wrote, “That concern has nothing to do with the legality of the competitive procurement system.”
“In other words, although plaintiffs describe their own treatment as impermissible under Michigan law, they cannot establish that the shift from a single-source procurement system to a competitive procurement system impermissibly alters the structure of PIHPs and CMHSPs,” he added.
Yates did not rule on one element of the case in his orders — the legality of the language in the Request for Proposal put forth by the Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget to collect bids for these these contracts. 
In his second order denying the injunction, Yates wrote, “Only when declaratory relief has failed should the courts even begin to consider additional forms of relief in these situations.” 
Because of the remaining question about the Request for Proposal language, Yates said that that the question of injunctive relief could be reconsidered once a decision had been made on that final portion of the case.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 15:12:29+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut DCF launches review after remains of 12-year-old found in New Britain,Jim Haddadin | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/ct-dcf-review-new-britain-girl-remains/,Questions about DCF’s contact emerged after New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said the agency had been involved with the girl’s family.,"Connecticut’s child welfare agency is reviewing its involvement with the family of a 12-year-old girl whose remains were found in New Britain last week.
Interim Department of Children and Families (DCF) Commissioner Susan Hamilton said in a statement Tuesday the agency is looking into its past contact with Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres Garcia and her caregivers.
“Consistent with our practice, this multidisciplinary review will include our knowledge about the family, supports provided, casework decisions, adherence to policy, as well as communication and collaboration with other system and community partners,” Hamilton said.
Questions about DCF’s contact with the family emerged after New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said Monday that the agency had previously been involved with the girl’s family. The extent of that engagement remains unclear.
Torres Garcia attended public schools in New Britain from kindergarten through fifth grade. Her mother withdrew Torres Garcia from the school system on Aug. 26, 2024, the first day of sixth grade, and provided a new address for the family in Farmington, according to a spokesperson for the Consolidated School District of New Britain. The girl’s mother filed a notice the same day indicating Torres Garcia would receive instruction at home, according to the school system.
Authorities said Torres Garcia was never reported missing. New Britain police discovered her body Oct. 8, 2025 inside a storage bin after receiving a report of suspicious activity at an abandoned home in the city.
Investigators believe Torres Garcia likely died in fall 2024 while her family lived in Farmington. Farmington Police Chief Paul Melanson said evidence indicates she suffered prolonged physical abuse and malnourishment, and that her body was kept in a basement before being moved when the family relocated in March 2025.
The girl’s mother and her mother’s boyfriend have been charged with her murder. An aunt was also charged with unlawful restraint, risk of injury to a minor and intentional cruelty to a person under 19 years old.
The case comes several months after an arrest in Waterbury raised questions about the adequacy of Connecticut’s child protection systems. A woman there is charged with holding her 32-year-old stepson captive for more than two decades, keeping him in a small room that was locked from the outside from the time he was 11.
The case sparked an extensive review by DCF, as well as contentious public policy debates about the safeguards in place for children who are homeschooled in Connecticut.
The victim in Waterbury told investigators his family pulled him out of school in fourth grade after school officials raised concern about his wellbeing. DCF said it investigated six reports involving the alleged victim, but didn’t find sufficient evidence to substantiate allegations of neglect.
Few details have emerged regarding DCF’s involvement with the family of Torres Garcia. A Farmington police spokesperson declined to provide additional information.
“The Farmington Police Department has begun to sift through the DCF documents, and it would be unfair to all involved to comment before we had a complete understanding of the amount of involvement and timeline as it relates to this family,” he wrote.
In her statement, the acting DCF commissioner wrote that siblings of Torres Garcia are safe and have been placed together in state custody. DCF encourages anyone with information regarding the matter to contact law enforcement.
State Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, ranking member of the Committee on Education, said she’s reserving judgment about the case until more information is available.
“If, at the end of August, she was pulled out for homeschooling, what happened before then? What was going on that people noted? Was she being followed by DCF before that? I have a lot of questions that I want answered,” Dauphinais said.
In a letter sent Tuesday, five lawmakers who represent New Britain in the Connecticut House and Senate called on DCF to provide a full and transparent accounting of how it handled the case. They outlined several key questions, including whether DCF coordinated with law enforcement and the school district.
“We stand ready to work with your office, with local partners, and with the broader community to strengthen the safety net for children and families in New Britain and across the state,” the letter reads. “Every child deserves to grow up safe, seen, and protected.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 12:04:44.769170

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)When Central Maine Power asked the Maine Public Utilities Commission for a massive rate hike last month — just three months after their previous rate increase kicked in — Mainers responded with disbelief and anger. Many already struggle to pay surging utility bills amid a flood tide of rising living expenses. Now CMP wants everyone to cough up another $420 per year on average.
CMP said it wants to make the grid more resilient in order to “provide greater financial stability and predictability for our customers.” The company argues that by increasing rates and investing in grid improvements it will boost reliability and reduce the amount of money it collects from ratepayers for “storm cost recovery” (the company wanted $228 million for 2024 storms alone).
But it’s not clear that raising rates will benefit CMP customers. As Maine’s Public Advocate Heather Sanborn put it, “while CMP claims that its plan is designed to provide ‘price stability,’ it is actually asking for greater profits and large, automatic rate increases over the next five years.” 
Even if CMP’s investments make the grid less prone to storm damage and reduce recovery costs, the net result for customers will be bigger bills that grow larger with each passing year.
The Public Utilities Commission should reject CMP’s rate hike request for two reasons. First, CMP is asking for too much profit — it wants almost 10% off the top, which is excessive for a low-risk investment in a protected monopoly. Regulated utilities are entitled to a “fair and reasonable” return but no more.
As former utility executive turned consumer advocate Mark Ellis argues, a reasonable rate of return for regulated utilities should align with the market-based cost of capital for similar low-risk investment, which is more on the order of 6%. For CMP to pocket over 60% more to further enrich shareholders and executives when many customers are struggling to pay for basic necessities is unacceptable. Why should Mainers be squeezed harder while CMP rakes in bigger profits (up 61% since 2014)?
Second, CMP hasn’t done its homework — two summers ago the Public Utilities Commission asked the company to submit a 10-year “Integrated Grid Plan” mapping out a detailed roadmap for how it will improve Maine’s grid. The plan is due in January but, as of late August, CMP was still in the “needs assessment” phase. 
Meanwhile, CMP released its own five-year “Investing in Maine’s Future” plan to justify the big rate hike. This plan is much more limited in scope than what the Public Utilities Commission asked for, mainly focused on investments like hiring line workers, replacing poles and wires, and tree work — all worthwhile improvements but hardly a comprehensive plan to modernize Maine’s grid for the 21st century.
Before the Public Utilities Commission considers burdening Mainers with such an enormous rate increase, it should insist that CMP submit the Integrated Grid Plan that was requested almost a year and a half ago. CMP needs to show it has a detailed roadmap for overhauling the grid infrastructure and, just as importantly, it needs to show it is capable of successfully undertaking the project. 
We all agree that we need to invest in Maine’s grid to make it more resilient, to support greater demand as Maine transitions from petroleum fuels to electricity, to accommodate more clean renewable generation sources, and to take advantage of more “smart grid” technology like distributed energy resources. This will require serious investment, expertise, and careful planning. There’s too much at stake here to simply allow CMP to jack rates up now before we have a clear comprehensive plan in place.
The commission should deny CMP’s rate increase request and tell the company to submit its Integrated Grid Plan first. And they should make it very clear they won’t allow CMP to profit excessively off the backs of Maine’s beleaguered ratepayers.

Caitlin Cavanagh, Michigan State University
Detroit is seeing declines in violent crime, but 33% more young people were victims of gun violence in the city so far in 2025 compared with the previous year, according to local police.
Mayor Mike Duggan and the Detroit Police Department responded by introducing the Summer Teen Safety Violence Prevention Plan in July 2025. As part of the plan, city leaders promised to increase curfew enforcement. Year-round, teens must abide by curfews of 10 p.m. or 11.p.m., depending on their age.
Also in July, the Detroit City Council voted to raise the fines parents will face if their children violate curfew to US$250 for a first offense and $500 for a second offense. Before the vote, parents were fined $75 for the first offense and $100 for the second, an amount that hadn’t been changed for decades.
I am a developmental psychologist and associate professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University, where I study how juvenile justice policy affects children and families.
While the curfew and fines are designed to deter crime by encouraging parents to keep a closer eye on their kids, research suggests it could instead worsen economic hardship and existing inequities among vulnerable families.
I believe that understanding youth crime through the lens of adolescent development offers communities more promising ways forward.
 Parents play key role

Parents matter. Evidence shows strong parental involvement reduces youth crime. Parents who know what their children are doing, who their friends are and where they are spending their time are more likely to keep them out of criminal or dangerous situations.
At the same time, adolescence is a period when young people work to develop independent identities. Research shows that parents balance this transition most effectively not through surveillance but through showing genuine interest in their children’s lives, setting fair boundaries and staying connected.
Many people believe that teens value peers’ opinions more than their parents’. But the evidence shows that teens adopt the values and attitudes of caring parental figures, including their attitudes about the law.
The fact that parents have such a strong influence over delinquency makes the question of legal parental responsibility particularly important.
 What does the law say?

In the United States, parents may be held legally responsible for their children’s actions through civil and – in rare cases such as the Ethan Crumbley case – criminal liability. Crumbley’s parents were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter tied to a 2021 school shooting carried out by their son.
Fines like the ones imposed on Detroit parents for their children’s curfew violations are usually status offenses – behaviors that are illegal only because of a child’s status as a minor. Examples include consistently missing school, running away, underage drinking and curfew violations. The goal of curfews is to prevent delinquency late in the evening, although a systemic review of relevant research suggests that youth curfews have no effect on crime.
When minors are charged with a status offense, parents are automatically implicated. However, the role that parents play legally varies by state. Some states, including Michigan, impose purely punitive sanctions such as fines or jail time. Others, like Connecticut, combine culpability with parental support programs.
 Do parental responsibility laws work?

Despite widespread use, there’s little evidence to support the idea that parental responsibility laws deter delinquency. Instead, they may produce unintended harms.
Three challenges limit their effectiveness.
First, my own research finds that parents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, often lack knowledge of juvenile justice laws and processes. Parents cannot prevent or respond to violations they do not fully understand.
Second, fining parents for curfew violations may put extra financial pressure on families that are already struggling. These fines are based on the idea that parents aren’t supervising their children well enough. In reality, even caring and attentive parents may not be able to stop a teenager from breaking curfew if they’re working late or juggling multiple jobs. Families that can least afford these fines are hit the hardest, making their financial situation even worse. On top of that, fines can damage relationships between parents and kids, and add stress and stigma to the household.
Third, punishing parents with fines can make existing inequalities worse, since youth from disadvantaged backgrounds are more often cited for minor offenses such as curfew violations.
These penalties especially affect single mothers of color who already face poverty, heavy policing in their community and accumulated disadvantage from loss of generational wealth after decades of earning lower incomes.
 Why do kids engage in crime?

Finding appropriate solutions to youth crime necessitates understanding why youth engage in crime in the first place.
Neuropsychological research shows that teens are more prone to risk-taking because their brains are still developing. This fact was acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons and Miller v. Alabama, which protect minors from execution and mandatory life sentences.
Compared to adults, young people are less able to weigh long-term consequences, resist peer pressure, regulate emotions and control impulses. At the same time, their brains are especially sensitive to novelty and social rewards. This combination means that, in emotionally charged situations, teens may engage in risky or even harmful behavior despite potential consequences.
 What policies show promise?

Policies are most effective when they align with developmental science.
Research shows community-based programs, multisystemic therapy, risk-needs assessments and restorative justice work to reduce recidivism.
These approaches involve family and community resources, strengthen skills for adult life, and foster accountability without the added harms of punitive sanctions.
Positive parent-child relationships are critical to keep children out of crime. My research finds that high-quality parent-child relationships reduce first-offense recidivism, but the effect can erode with repeated offending.
This work highlights the need for rehabilitative interventions that strengthen – rather than burden – parent-child relationships. For example, research finds that family-focused programs that teach parenting strategies improve youth outcomes during and after court involvement.
Adolescents’ brains are still maturing, making them prone to impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and reward-driven behavior. While these tendencies can lead to harmful behavior such as crime, they can also take positive forms such as pushing limits in sports or getting on stage in the school play.
Community-based programs that offer safe, supportive spaces can redirect youths’ natural risk-taking into positive outlets. Activities that capitalize on strengths, such as the arts, sports and clubs, foster belonging and purpose while reducing isolation and reliance on antisocial peers.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two in three South Dakota parents who want afterschool programs for their children are unable to enroll them, in many cases because programs are too expensive, unavailable or inaccessible, according to a survey commissioned by the Afterschool Alliance and released Wednesday.
“Every child deserves access to a quality afterschool program but sadly, this study shows we’re far from reaching that goal,” said Afterschool Alliance Executive Director Jodi Grant in a news release. “We need greater support from federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and philanthropy to change that.”
Belief in education’s role in community drove $33 million gift, donor says

The Afterschool Alliance is a nonprofit working to ensure that children have access to quality afterschool programs. Its America After 3PM survey finds that 76% of South Dakota parents with a child in an afterschool program rate it as excellent or very good, and there is broad support among South Dakota parents for public funding for the programs.
Overall in South Dakota, the parents of 64,080 children want afterschool programs while 21,645 children are enrolled, the study found. Nearly 9 in 10 South Dakota parents favor public funding for afterschool opportunities, according to the survey. A majority of parents in the state say the programs keep kids safe, build their social skills and responsible decision making, and help parents keep their jobs and boost their productivity at work.
Conducted by Edge Research, the fifth edition of America After 3PM is based on a survey of 30,515 U.S. parents with school-age children in their households, including in-depth interviews with 222 in South Dakota.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, says he has raised nearly $600,000 since launching his campaign. 
Colom’s campaign shared with Mississippi Today ahead of Tuesday’s campaign fundraising reporting deadline that he has over $580,000 in cash on hand, a sizable amount for a first-time Senate candidate. The campaign said this was the largest amount a Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat  in Mississippi has ever raised in its initial three-month period. 
The campaign did not share the itemized list of contributions, making it unclear what the largest source of donations is, though it did say that Colom received donations from more than 3,400 individuals. More information on who gave to the Colom campaign should be available later Wednesday when the reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission.
If Colom, the current district attorney in the Golden Triangle area, wants to become the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Mississippi since the 1980s, raising the money necessary to topple an incumbent Republican will be crucial. 
Hyde-Smith’s latest fundraising numbers are not yet available. From January to June, she reported to the Federal Election Commission raising around $1.2 million and having around $1.4 million in cash on hand.

The Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation published a draft of a proposed amendment to allow curbside pickup at dispensaries on Tuesday and is asking for public feedback until Oct. 28. 
Mark Hendren, president of Flora Farms cannabis company, said the change would help his three dispensary locations that don’t currently offer drive-thru services. The other five Flora Farm locations already have drive-thrus.
“When a customer comes in, they have to physically get out and come into the facility and go through the normal check-in process,” Hendren said. “And for some of our customers that are disabled, that’s a burden.”
According to the rule draft, customers would pay for the products online so no cash is exchanged outside the facility in the pickup location. The pickup site would need the same video camera monitoring and recording the drive-through lanes currently have. 
The dispensaries would need to post a sign, stating: “It is against the law to operate a dangerous device, motor vehicle, aircraft, or motorboat while under the influence of marijuana,” according to the draft.
The draft released Tuesday is not part of a formal rulemaking process, according to a press release by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which oversees the division.
It’s “instead part of DHSS’ ongoing efforts to gather all relevant input before formally filing proposed rules and proposed changes to rules,” the press release states. 
The proposed amendment is designed to improve cannabis licensee operations by, “offering a more accessible purchasing option for medical patients, primary caregivers and consumers, particularly those with physical limitations,” it states.

Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Carl Aveni granted a 14-day temporary restraining order on Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive order banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products on Oct. 14. 
DeWine announced last week a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that also started on Oct.14. The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Oct. 28.

Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. 
Marijuana is not considered an intoxicating hemp product and is legal in Ohio. This ban does not affect the marijuana law passed by voters in 2023.
“While we continue to fight in court, today’s developments underscore our continued desire to work with the General Assembly to pass permanent legislation regarding intoxicating hemp,” DeWine said in a statement.
Titan Logistic Group, Fumee Smoke and Vape and Invicta Partners — all members of the Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association — filed a lawsuit last week against the ban, arguing DeWine is breaking federal and state law by restricting access to these products. 
“Today’s decision allows thousands of hardworking Ohio entrepreneurs to continue supporting their families and serving consumers who rely on access to safe, legal, and properly regulated hemp products,” Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association said in a statement.
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
“The Executive Order is overly broad in that it applies to all hemp and hemp products including those that are legal under the 2018 Farm Bill and Ohio’s current laws,” the lawsuit says. 
“It is also vague because there is no definition of ‘intoxicating hemp’ in the Ohio Revised Code or Ohio Administrative Code.”
DeWine — who has been calling on lawmakers to regulate or ban delta-8 THC products since January 2024 — spent much of last week’s press conference where he announced the ban talking about the need to protect children from these products. 
It was reported in January 2024 that there had been at least 257 reports of delta-8 poisoning in Ohio in recent years — including 102 in 2023 and 40 that involved children under six-years-old, according to the Ohio Poison Control Center.

The plaintiffs, however, disagree.
“Governor DeWine lacks a basis to use an executive order to regulate all hemp products because there is no evidence hemp products pose an imminent threat to public health,” the lawsuit reads. 
Ohio has more than 4,000 small businesses and family-owned businesses that sell hemp products, according to the lawsuit. 
The Ohio Capital Journal talked to people in the hemp industry who were worried what DeWine’s ban would mean for their businesses and customers. 
Hemp products account for all of Titan’s sales and they will be forced to close if the ban goes into effect, according to the court documents. 
Approximately 25% of Fumee’s sales are hemp products and they expect to fire half of their staff if the ban takes place, according to the court documents. 
“Governor DeWine’s order was not only unlawful — it was an abuse of executive authority that threatened to devastate an entire sector overnight,” Dakota Sawyer of American Republic Policy said in a statement. “Today’s decision restores sanity and due process.”
Jim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp in Kentucky, which sells its products in more than 300 Ohio retail stores, said the judge’s ruling was a win for Ohio. 
“By granting the TRO, the court recognized that Governor DeWine’s reckless executive order should not take effect without proper legislative debate and due process,” Higdon said in a statement.
“This decision protects adult Ohioans’ access to federally legal hemp products and sends a clear message to the legislature that it must act.”
There are a handful of bills in the Ohio legislature that would regulate intoxicating hemp products in various ways.
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

At the time, the cooperative had 925 people — both office personnel and linemen working 16-hour shifts — who it needed to keep safe, said CEO Gary Stooksbury.
“When you have a situation like we had, people get desperate,” Stooksbury said. “And when people get desperate, they do things that they normally would not do.”

Downed power lines were not the only hazard electric workers encountered on the job following the deadly storm that swept across much of the Southeast.
Sometimes, the danger came from the residents of 1.3 million South Carolina homes and business left in the dark by the storm a year ago.
In an effort to protect their crews and prevent similar issues in the future, the Palmetto State’s power cooperatives plan to ask legislators to enact a law to deter people who might threaten or attack linemen or other workers, such as road crews, responding at times of natural disaster.
“Our focus is to make sure anybody who is restoring critical infrastructure in a time of natural disaster is protected,” said John Frick, the cooperatives’ senior vice president for public policy. “You’re really talking about people’s lives and families out there that will be forever affected. So, you have to make sure you protect the workers that are just out there doing their job.”
This could include tougher criminal penalties for threats made during a state of emergency.
South Carolina already has laws on the books that apply in times of emergency declared by the governor, such as fines and misdemeanor penalties for business owners convicted of price gouging, as well as felony charges for looters.
“Most of the public has been extremely good to our people and first responders,” Frick said.
That included church congregations that brought meals for linemen and school children who wrote and mailed thank you cards.
“But a few people have not (been good),” Frick said. “That endangers everybody and actually slows down restoration efforts.”
Frick said cooperatives are open to measures other than criminal charges as long as it keeps people safe.

When it comes to the Aiken cooperative customer, Stooksbury said the man “just took his frustration out over the phone.” The customer never actually came armed to the office.
Still, cooperative staff had to take the threat seriously. They called the sheriff’s department, and police arrested the man without incident.
As an added precaution, the cooperative hired police officers to stand watch at its offices across three counties.
After all, Stooksbury has seen things go another way.
At the executive’s first job out of college, working in the offices of Tennessee Valley Authority, a landowner shot and killed a power company employee while the worker was out surveying property for a new power line.
“It was a tragic situation,” Stooksbury said.
“Being a lineman is a very dangerous job,” he added. “You need to be focused on what you are doing rather than worrying about somebody coming up behind you or getting threatened out on a roadway.”
While South Carolina is no stranger to hurricanes, Helene wrought severe and widespread devastation not seen since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. That coupled with more than two weeks without power took its toll.

“This was the longest outage we’ve ever had,” said Newberry Electric Cooperative CEO Keith Avery. “We literally had to rebuild lines on the opposite sides of roads because we couldn’t clear up the downed trees quick enough.”
Avery said Newberry Electric customers did not make any threats but several frustrated people showed up to the office. Two even drove past the gate into the storage yard full of spare parts and heavy machinery, disrupting crew members who were loading replacement power poles onto a work truck.
“You’ve got people out there working. They’re loading poles with forklifts. They’re focused on their job,” Avery said. “They’re not focused on you pulling in there, and that creates a whole different hazard.”
Days after employees managed to calm down one woman angry about having been without power for more than a week, a man came into the yard trying to convince crews to come to his house and get his lights back on.
On a third occasion, a woman approached a crew fixing a downed power line telling them how the workers who had been at her house that day hadn’t restored her electricity.
“When you have downed power lines, anything can happen. The work site itself is hazardous,” Avery said. “Come to find out, she wasn’t even our member.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4859-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:56:35.681674

But those teachers won’t be in classrooms, sitting behind desks. They’ll be on the screen. 
The REACH MS program, also called the Mississippi Virtual Synchronous Learning Initiative, funded by a $2.2 million appropriation from the Legislature, is a response to the teacher shortage afflicting swaths of Mississippi schools. 
There are thousands of vacant teaching posts in Mississippi, according to a recent MDE survey. While the virtual-teacher program doesn’t replace recruitment efforts, said associate state superintendent Bryan Marshall, it’s one of the state’s latest attempts to address the teacher shortage. Those include a revamped teacher recruitment website and increased funding to pay tuition and licensure expenses for college students who commit to teaching in “critical shortage areas.” That’s a category that 56% of Mississippi school districts fall into. 
Participating districts that are struggling to staff core subjects can get a virtual teacher through the program. All they have to do is make sure special-education students are accommodated, enter grades and attendance, provide a classroom, in-person facilitators and reliable internet. 
Five districts — Hinds County, Yazoo County, Yazoo City, Claiborne and West Point — are part of the pilot program, as well as three certified teachers and three teacher assistants who are college students on the cusp of finishing their teaching degrees. 
In this way, Marshall says the initiative addresses the state’s teacher shortage in two ways: staffing hard-to-teach subject areas and strengthening the teacher pipeline.
“The idea is that we would keep the student teachers for a period, and then they would go on into the classroom, and we’d bring on a new set,” Marshall said. “We’re trying to provide resources to districts without taking teachers away from them.”
It’s clear the agency is proud of the new program and optimistic about what it can accomplish. State Superintendent Lance Evans has been publicly championing the initiative for the past year — at Capitol hearings, board meetings and press events. A powerpoint about REACH MS claims each teacher has the capacity to serve up to 450 students. 
Post-pandemic, though, it’s hard not to wonder if the program is promising more than it can deliver. Research shows that when education is online, student learning, focus and engagement suffer. 
But the agency — and students — argue that this initiative, with its classroom setting and in-person facilitators, is different.

The classroom experience
Teenagers in red-collared shirts and khaki pants peer over their laptops at their teacher, Caitlin Perkins. She’s at the front of the Yazoo City High School classroom, giving a lesson on how to write thesis statements. 
In actuality, she’s about an hour away at the Mississippi Public Broadcasting offices in Jackson, but it doesn’t seem to matter to the students.  
They’re engaged, paying rapt attention to their on-screen teacher and even answering her questions out loud. Another teacher, on what’s supposed to be her planning period break, walks around as an in-person facilitator, keeping students quiet and passing out worksheets. 
It’s pretty close to what Sametra Brown, assistant superintendent of federal programs, imagined when the agency reached out about the district’s participation in the virtual teacher program. 
“In a critical teacher shortage area, these are certified teachers,” she said. “We felt that this would be a wonderful opportunity for our students to still have a highly qualified certified educator in front of them, but give them that virtual experience.” 
Yazoo City Municipal School District has struggled for a long time, in general. 
The district was merged with Humphreys County School District in 2019, creating Mississippi’s first Achievement School District. The partnership created a single state-run district in an effort to turn the low-performing schools around. The districts divorced this summer but remain under state control. 
While the state education department reports that there are almost 3,000 open teaching jobs across Mississippi, teacher shortages disproportionately impact schools with high rates of poverty and larger minority student populations. 
More than a third of children under 18 in Yazoo County live in poverty, 2020 Census data shows. Data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation shows the 2023 median household income in Yazoo County was $42,434.
Yazoo City, which dropped from a C grade to an F in the latest district rankings, currently has 10 open teaching positions, administrators said. Three of those are at the high school, with two in core subject areas. Staffing challenges, ample national research shows, directly impact student achievement.
The program, Marshall said, was created for districts such as Yazoo City.
“Many people are not going into education now, so that’s a challenge,” Brown said, of the district’s staffing struggles. “We have to be creative in how we attract and retain teachers … Rather than our students having a substitute teacher in the classroom that has maybe no credentials, this was an opportunity for them to get live instruction.”
The virtual teacher came as a shock to Rodrianna Drain, Mikeria Brown and Devin Gibbs, three of the 14-year-olds in Perkins’ ninth-grade English class. They’re among some of the top students in the high school. School leaders chose the cream of the crop, they said, for the pilot program to better prepare them for online college classes and an increasingly virtual world. 
But now that the surprise has worn off, Brown actually prefers the virtual element over her other classes. She largely does classwork online, and typing out answers to writing prompts gives her time to think through her responses instead of immediately answering out loud. 
It makes sense that the set-up is appealing to this generation of students, who spent a chunk of their education learning at home during the pandemic. 
However, another vestige of pandemic-era learning is throwing some wrenches into the program: Technology problems. 
Perkins’ lesson buffered a little, her face momentarily frozen while her class waited patiently. The students noted that occasionally the computers are slow and the Wi-Fi sometimes goes out. 
Those issues are usually quickly resolved and the kinks are worth it, they said. The three students really like Perkins, one of the program’s student teachers, describing her as a dramatic storyteller when she reads out loud which makes it easier for them to engage with the text. 
“We’re not just writing more, but we’re actually understanding more about it,” Drain said. “She talks to us like she’s one of us.” 
Before she logs off, Perkins confirms the students don’t have any more questions. Then they wave goodbye, and the screen goes black.

Futuristic technology
Much of what makes the virtual teacher program stand out compared to pandemic virtual learning, Marshall said, are eGlass systems. 
They’re also partially what makes the program so pricey (in addition to the technology and infrastructure needs of districts and employee salaries). All of the equipment required for the futuristic contraptions, which the company describes as “illuminated transparent lightboards” that have a camera to monitor the classroom, costs about $3,000. 
Marshall said the lightboards are essential because they’re interactive and allow teachers to teach in real time. Leslie Hebert, one of the teachers in the program and the education program development specialist for K-12 literacy at MPB, said while the program is less hands-on, the lessons are more in-depth because of the technology.
“This is not your normal sit-and-get-lectured style of teaching,” Marshall said. “When the pandemic was here, it was really that the teachers talked and the kids listened and that was it … This is almost like having a real person in the classroom. When you couple it with a facilitator to keep kids on task, that’s a game changer.” 
Right now, the program uses two eGlass systems and offers English I, English III, Algebra I and Algebra II classes. About 150 students are involved across the five districts, but the program has the capacity for 5,400 students, six teachers and six assistants when it’s fully scaled up. 
They’ll be adding math and science classes to the program in the spring, Marshall said, and 12 more eGlass systems are on the way. The initiative started small because the agency’s appropriation wasn’t finalized until late in the summer due to legislators bickering over the state budget. 
And Evans is pushing for more resources. He said recently that he’s asking the Legislature to continue funding the program next year to expand it. 
The more students, the better, Hebert said. The program is helping her reach more students than she used to teach in a traditional classroom setting. The medium matters less. 
“At the end of the day, it’s about teaching children,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16152118/3X0A7890.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:56:35.681674

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities is planning to remove trash, waste, and the belongings of unhoused Alaskans from land near state highways, continuing an offensive that began last year.
In a public notice published last week, the department said it is seeking bids from contractors who can perform “the as needed removal of unauthorized encampments … at various locations within the state” that are managed by DOT&PF.
The department did not say how much it proposes to spend on the removal, only that “approval or continuation of a contract resulting from this (invitation to bid) is contingent upon legislative appropriation.”
Alaska’s hub cities, particularly Anchorage, have a large population of unhoused residents. 



Camps already removed by Alaska DOT&PF
Since November 2024, the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities has identified eight encampments that it has removed:

NW/SW/SE quadrants of the 36th/Seward Highway Intersection (Anch)
East Fireweed Road/Parks Highway (Mat-Su)
Minnesota/International off-ramp (Anch)
Seward Meridian/Blue Lupine (Mat-Su)
NE quadrant of the Tudor/Seward Highway intersection (Anch)
A Street – between 36th Avenue and 38th Avenue (Anch)
Seward Highway – south side, Campbell Creek Bridge (Anch)
International Airport Road & Minnesota Drive – Northeast Interchange Area (Anch)




Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it is legal for local governments to ban outdoor camping, even if no homeless shelter space is available. That move has provided the legal justification for large-scale camp removal nationwide, and since the ruling, DOT&PF has removed eight encampments in southcentral Alaska.
According to the proposed contract, the winning bidder will be available “on an on-call, as-needed, and/or urgent basis.” The contract will last for one year, but it can be renewed up to four times for additional one-year terms.
The contract is expected to be issued by Nov. 11 and would go into effect in December. 
“This is a continuation of the work the department has always undertaken and was of particular focus, in coordination with local government partners, starting last year to remove encampments within state highway (right of way),” said Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson for the department, by email.
Under state law and federal regulations, McCarthy said, the department must ensure that rights of way — the land designated for transportation — are actually used for transportation and are clear of things that might obstruct the right of way or could cause a safety risk.
“In addition, encampments in the ROW (right of way) have increased the risk of pedestrians vs. vehicle crashes, caused traffic conflicts that result in serious injury and fatalities, prevented the public from using these rights-of-way, and severely limit the intended highway buffer zones for purposes such as safety pullouts, noise buffers, stormwater retention/filtration areas, and other transportation and functional purposes,” McCarthy wrote.
In April, DOT&PF Commissioner Ryan Anderson signed a new policy describing how DOT will remove encampments.
Under that policy, encampments underneath bridges, near utility structures or on medians are the highest priority to be removed.
The policy also requires consultation with the Alaska Department of Law “to ensure constitutional and civil rights protections are observed.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC05563-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:00:31.367801

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)TOPEKA — More Kansas families with kindergarteners attending school last year claimed state vaccine exemptions than in previous years, and the “unfortunate melding” of science and politics may cause that number to keep rising, an infectious disease doctor said.
The number of kindergarteners with vaccine exemptions increased from 2.9% in the 2023-24 school year to 3.59% in 2024-25, according to Kansas Department of Health and Environment state vaccine data, reported in September.
The percentage of kindergarteners who received the state-required vaccines to attend school remained relatively stable, rising just three-tenths of a percent, from 86.7% to 87%, data showed.
But county data breakdowns highlighted wide disparities across Kansas, with Morton County in the southwest corner of the state reporting the lowest number of kindergarteners with required vaccines at 50%. Kingman County followed with 54.1%, then Decatur County at 60%.
Twenty-two Kansas counties reported vaccination rates at less than 75%.
“I have to believe, given the current climate and the unfortunate melding of medicine and science with politics and also, just from what we’ve seen in the recent past, that, yes, there will continue to be more exemptions,” said Dana Hawkinson, medical director of infection prevention and control at the University of Kansas Health System. “This will then also open the door, unfortunately, for more disease and more consequences and complications of that disease process, whatever that might be.”
Concerns about vaccine safety are being raised at the national level as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. expresses doubts about vaccine use, despite disagreement from all medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institutes of Health.
Some states have changed vaccine mandates based on legislators’ concerns, with Florida completely eliminating all vaccine mandates for children.
Kansas vaccine requirements follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, according to KDHE spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh.
“We are in the process of gathering the most current and accurate information before making any changes or issuing additional guidance or educational materials as it relates to current vaccine schedules and recommendations,” she said in an email.
Bronaugh did not answer a question about whether the state would continue to follow CDC recommendations as changes are implemented. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week recommended that the combined shot for measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox) be separated into two shots, with chickenpox being given separately and at a different time.
Decatur County on the Nebraska border saw a drop to 60% of the number of kindergarteners with the required number of vaccinations. The small school district has around 150 students, but the decline still raises concerns for local health officials.
“We’re been working with schools to send out reminders,” said Bobbi Koerperich, health officer at the Decatur County Health Department. “I don’t think the percentage is that low.”
Koerperich said the majority of the parents that health staff talk to are open to getting vaccinations. The health department is offering influenza vaccinations at the school next week, she said.
Low vaccination rates endanger herd immunity, which occurs when enough people in a population are immune that the spread of the disease is stopped. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2020, but measles cases surged in 2025, including in Kansas. 
Measles vaccine coverage dropped from 94.5% in Kansas in the 2019-20 school year to 90.6% in 2024-25, KDHE data said.
Hawkinson said the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly called the MMR, is safe.
“We know that they are safe and they are effective, but now what we are seeing is a conscious dismantling of the vaccination strategies, of the continued information to try and dissuade people from getting vaccinations,” he said. “If this continues, in my opinion, probably in the next five to 10 years, (this will be) the largest public health experiment in recent times that we have seen, because of the continued decrease in vaccination rates and increase in exemptions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1309140442-1.jpg,,,2025-10-15 10:00:31.367801

In Tuesday’s newsletter, I mentioned some of the new laws California will enact. Now let’s dig into what didn’t make it past the governor’s desk.
At the end of this year’s legislative session, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 out of the 917 total bills lawmakers sent to him — a slightly lower veto rate of 13.4% compared to last year’s 15.7%. 
One of the bills he spiked Monday would have raised the cap car dealers can charge to process Department of Motor Vehicles’ and other paperwork from $85 to $260, writes CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.
In his veto message, the governor said that consumers could be charged “hundreds more for only minutes of data entry” even though there are no new state requirements and DMV processes are getting more streamlined.
Read more here.
Newsom also rejected a handful of bills intended to expand health care coverage, such as ones that would have required health insurers to cover a year’s worth of prescription hormone therapy; treatment for menopause; and behavioral health visits for wildfire victims. In his veto messages, he repeatedly said California lawmakers should avoid enacting policies that would drive up health care costs “at a time when individuals are facing double-digit rate increases in their health care premiums” nationwide.
Other notable bills Newsom vetoed:

‘Forever chemicals’ and microplastics: The governor rejected a bill that would have banned the sale of cleaning products, dental floss, cookware and other items that contain PFAS substances, which can be toxic. He also vetoed a bill that would have banned cosmetics that include plastic glitter.


Immigration raids and schools: Citing “substantial cost pressures,” Newsom vetoed a bill that would enable schools to avoid defunding due to drops in attendance from “immigration enforcement activity.” The bill was introduced in response to January’s federal immigration raids in Kern County. 


Honey bees: Newsom shot down a bill that would have established a health program for struggling managed honey bees arguing that the issue should have been considered in the state’s annual budget process instead.

The clash over CA’s antisemitism prevention measure

One bill Newsom did approve was a highly contentious measure intended to curb antisemitism in schools by restricting what teachers could mention and teach in classrooms. The bill forced many Democratic lawmakers to grapple the needs of Jewish communities, a key voting block, with the intense outrage of a growing pro-Palestinian base, report CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Mikhail Zinshteyn.
After several rounds of rewriting, Assembly Bill 715 ultimately bans using professional development materials that violate the state’s anti-discrimination laws. It also requires “factually accurate” instruction that is free of “advocacy, personal opinion, bias, or partisanship.”
Issuing warnings that the measure could censor free speech, some Democratic lawmakers voted to pass the bill nonetheless. Others abstained, including Assemblymember Robert Garcia of Rancho Cucamonga, who said the bill “only reinforces broader national trends of … erasing historically relevant curriculum.”
The issue was so controversial that when the bill arrived in June before the Senate Education Committee, it still had no substantive language, said Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez. The Pasadena Democrat and chairperson of the committee added that some lawmakers told her either to leave it untouched as well, or left it up to her to “take care of it.”

Pérez: “The ball got thrown to me. And people knew that they were doing that.”

Kaiser nurses go on strike


Striking Kaiser Permanente workers hold signs as they march in front of the Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center in Oakland on Oct. 14, 2025. Photo by Justin Sullivan, Getty Images




From CalMatters health reporter Kristen Hwang:
At 7 a.m. sharp Tuesday, tens of thousands of Kaiser Permanente employees across California walked off the job, starting the largest strike in their union’s history. 
The union — United Nurse Association of California/Union of Health Care Professionals — represents 31,000 registered nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and other health workers.
Many, holding umbrellas and signs saying “Fair Contract NOW,” stood outside medical centers in the pouring rain.
The strike, which Kaiser called “unnecessary and disruptive,” will end Oct. 19. 
At issue are salaries, benefits and staffing levels. The union wants a 25% raise over four years and limits on how many patients providers see in a day.

Christopher Pereida, a nurse practitioner in Lancaster: “The strike is about patient care, patient safety and having Kaiser put patients over profits.”

Kaiser argues the union’s demands would force the company to increase premiums for patients.
Twelve thousand Kaiser workers in Oregon and Hawaii are also striking.

,California,2025-10-15 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom vetoes car dealers’ bill to hike fees on buyers,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/california-car-dealer-fees-veto/,Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed one bill and signed another that could change how you purchase a vehicle in California.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed one bill and signed another that could change how you purchase a vehicle in California. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have allowed California’s car dealers to tack on another $175 in fees to the cost of buying a vehicle. 
On Monday, Newsom announced he wasn’t going to sign Senate Bill 791, which would have raised the fees dealers can charge to process Department of Motor Vehicles and other paperwork from $85 to up to 1% of the purchase price, capped at $260.
In his veto message, Newsom said the fee increase made little sense since a car buyer would be paying a dealership “for only minutes of data entry.”  
“At a time when Californians are already struggling with the high cost of living,” Newsom wrote, “this bill would raise the document processing fee to three times the current $85 cap – far beyond what an inflation adjustment would justify.”
Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said in an emailed statement that the state’s car sellers “were extremely disappointed” by the veto.
Maas said the current $85 cap on the document-processing fee is “by far the lowest in the country.” The now-dead fee increase, he said, would still have been at “the bottom quartile of such charges across the nation.” 
Car dealers argue that the Legislature continually passes new laws that add to their costs. They say other kinds of businesses are allowed to recoup those costs through service charges, but dealers can’t because the $85 cap is set in state law.
The dealers were especially frustrated with Newsom’s veto because he also signed a measure this month that adds a number of requirements on car dealers that are intended to prevent buyers from getting suckered as they haggle over the price of a vehicle. 
Notably, that measure, Senate Bill 766, creates a first-in-the-nation policy that allows a used car buyer to return a vehicle for a full refund within three days if the purchase price was less than $50,000. Dealers can charge a restocking fee.
The new law requires dealers to disclose the full costs up front, and it prohibits dealers from charging for add-ons that have no benefits to the buyer, such as free oil changes for electric vehicles — which don’t need oil changes.
The law takes effect Oct. 1, 2026.
Maas said “the Legislature continues to place more burdens on dealers. SB 766 only added significantly to those responsibilities, which makes the veto of SB 791 all the more disappointing.”
The California New Car Dealers Association has donated at least $3 million to legislators since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database.
How did the fee increase easily pass?
It was perhaps surprising that the bill to hike fees made it to the governor’s desk at all, given that legislative leaders from both parties had promised to lower costs this year. 
Yet the Senate overwhelmingly passed an earlier version of the bill that was even more expensive. It proposed upping the fee to $500. 
Only one of the Legislature’s 40 senators, Calabasas-area Democratic Sen. Henry Stern, voted “no.” 
After CalMatters reported on the controversial measure passing the Senate, its author, San Jose Democratic Sen. Dave Cortese lowered the proposed fee in the Assembly first to $350 and then eventually to $260. 
Cortese said in an interview the amount the Legislature settled on would have provided the minimum dealers need to recoup their costs to pay employees who might “spend an hour and a half filling out documents” state regulations require for a single sale.
“There’s 113 different documents now that we’ve created,” he said. “Every single one of them is legislative created. …  We were trying to get fair remuneration for fair work.” 
In the Assembly, the bill passed with only three Democrats – Alex Lee of San Jose, Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks and Tasha Boerner of Solana Beach – voting “no.” Seventeen other Assembly members didn’t vote at all, which counts the same as voting “no.” 
As CalMatters reported, Democrats almost never vote “no” on their colleagues’ bills. Instead, they typically don’t vote at all. In the Capitol, it’s seen as a more polite way of saying “no” and less likely to lead to retaliation from other lawmakers and lobbyists.

With so much talk of lowering costs this year, Cortese said he could understand why the governor wasn’t as receptive to his arguments about fairness to car dealers as his colleagues in the Legislature were.
“The perception was stalking us the whole way through, no question about it,” Cortese said. “And I can understand why the governor would be sensitive to that.”
Rosemary Shahan of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety said she was “thrilled to bits” that Newsom vetoed the would-be “junk fee” increase and signed the law protecting car buyers from “the kind of bait-and-switch that goes on” when buying a vehicle. 
She said the new three-day cooling-off period to return a vehicle will be especially helpful, allowing buyers to review their paperwork without pressure. They can also have their vehicles inspected by an independent mechanic to make sure they didn’t drive a lemon off the lot. 
She called Newsom’s actions this year “huge wins for California car buyers.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/090723_EV_Lineup_LV_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220

(Stock.adobe.com photo by Nimur)Staying ahead of the curve is essential for any business to succeed. And to stay ahead of the growing clean energy economy in Maryland, contractors should prepare for what is quickly becoming the most popular form of heating and cooling: heat pumps.
More and more households are upgrading their homes with highly efficient heat pumps, which offer affordable, reliable and pollutant-free heating and cooling. According to the Building Decarbonization Coalition, heat pumps are 2.5 to four times more efficient than gas furnaces and nationally, the average heat pump sold uses 29% less electricity than central air conditioning.
For the second year in a row in 2024, shipments of heat pumps outpaced those of gas furnaces nationwide, and in Maryland, 54% of households are expected to adopt heat pumps by 2030. From the data, it’s clear that the market is increasingly shifting toward efficient, clean energy technology driven by rising customer demand.
In recent years, we’ve seen manufacturers release newer models of heat pumps that work efficiently in the coldest of weather, including the deep freeze that Maryland experienced this past winter. Inverter heat pump systems have revolutionized the market by being efficient and providing the necessary heating capacity to keep residents warm and comfortable in Maryland’s cold weather.
With new technologies entering the market and the growing popularity of heat pumps, Maryland’s contractors have a golden opportunity ahead of them, especially as Maryland leaders advance a suite of policies to help more households adopt heat pumps. By seizing this momentum, contractors can attract more customers, access crucial resources and skills, and position themselves — and their business — for long-term success.

In recent years, Maryland lawmakers have passed legislation doubling down on clean-energy technology. Just last year, the state passed legislation that strengthens EmPOWER, the state’s signature energy efficiency program, to ensure more households can adopt clean energy appliances. Under the new law, utilities are rolling out financial incentives this summer for efficient electric technologies, with Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) providing $2,500 for a heat pump water heater and up to $20,000 to upgrade homes with air source heat pumps. As part of the 2024 law, BG&E is also offering training and bonuses to contractors to help them pursue more electrification projects.
The reforms to EmPOWER highlight how Maryland contractors can meet the moment to propel their business forward. By helping homeowners access the thousands of dollars available in rebates when upgrading to a heat pump, contractors can share the value of clean-heating technologies and expand their customer base. With the electrification trainings from BGE, contractors can also access resources and learn new skills that will help millions of Maryland households lower their energy bills, breathe cleaner air, and upgrade to efficient, electric equipment.
Those skills are going to be especially important as Maryland rolls out another policy to accelerate heat pump adoption in the coming years. Last year, Gov. Wes Moore signed a groundbreaking executive order that directs the Maryland Department of the Environment to develop zero-emission heating equipment standards (ZEHES), also known as healthy air standards, and a Clean Heat Standard.
The Moore administration is already taking action on this executive order by publishing a draft reporting rule for Maryland’s heating fuel providers last month — a critical first step to understanding how many fossil fuel systems are sold every year in Maryland. This rule will require fuel providers to report the monthly amount of heating fuel they deliver to Maryland by county starting in 2026. This is the kind of forward-looking policy that will help policymakers understand how to best upgrade homes with clean, efficient heating systems and is an example of the type of new clean-heating rules for which contractors should prepare.
With the potential to fully come into effect in just a few years, healthy air standards will gradually phase in the adoption of cleaner, more efficient alternatives such as highly efficient heat pumps to replace outdated fossil-fuel burning furnaces, boilers, and water heaters, directly combating smog and health-harming air pollution in Maryland communities.
The successful launch of these healthy air standards relies on Maryland’s contractors, who will be on the frontlines guiding homeowners and modernizing our state’s homes with clean energy technology. That’s why it’s important for contractors to get in on the ground floor right now. Understanding the many rebates available through EmPOWER, accessing the electrification trainings available, and learning about new heat pump technologies can help contractors modernize their business for the clean-energy economy that is already taking off.
As summer heat scorches Maryland, HVAC professionals are going from house to house fixing air conditioners to keep people cool. Their work is a lifeline to so many in the state. Now, thanks to the leadership of the governor, Maryland is creating new business opportunities that help these professionals grow their businesses and continue their essential work.
To be a part of this transformative change, and as a result, be a part of future success, Maryland’s HVAC professionals should begin preparing now to help guide their customers toward healthier, more efficient, and more affordable solutions.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_412644909-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220

Maura Healey proposed for the county law enforcement offices, in the process handing a new talking point to her GOP challengers for the corner office.","LEGISLATIVE LEADERS issued a rebuke to county sheriffs Tuesday, casting doubt on how the elected law enforcement officers are managing their own spending and teeing up a new campaign-season talking point for the gubernatorial race. 
After simmering behind the scenes for weeks, the budgetary feud between lawmakers and county sheriffs erupted into public view Tuesday when House Democrats unveiled a spending bill to close the financial books on the fiscal year that ended June 30 that withholds more than $130 million Healey proposed for sheriffs’ departments. The bill, however, would provide sheriffs’ offices with $14 million for treatment services and $12.5 million for the free communication program. 
Instead of funding the full request, which sheriffs say is necessary to cover those two programs as well as salary increases, the legislation that will receive a House vote Wednesday would task the state inspector general with investigating the sheriffs’ books. 
It’s a dramatic step at a time of heightened scrutiny for sheriffs, who are elected to manage local correctional systems. Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins faces federal extortion charges, Norfolk County Sheriff Patrick McDermott settled with state campaign finance regulators after unlawfully using taxpayer funds to cover online business courses, and Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi was arrested last month for allegedly driving while intoxicated. 
“Over the past few months, serious questions and concerns have been raised about the financial and operational integrity of our sheriffs’ offices across the Commonwealth,” the Legislature’s budget chiefs, Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Michael Rodrigues, said in a joint statement. “As we work to maintain fiscal stability, live within our means, and responsibly close the books on Fiscal Year 2025, it is clear that the Legislature must act to rein in questionable spending practices and restore public confidence in the sheriffs’ operations.” 
The $2.25 billion bill that emerged Tuesday covers a slew of spending and policy goals. After accounting for federal reimbursements, the measure would carry a net cost to the state of $750 million, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Like the original closeout budget proposal Gov. Maura Healey filed in August, the House redraft seeks more than $2 billion for MassHealth (with a projected net cost to the state of nearly $540 million), $60.7 million for snow and ice removal expenses, $12 million to cover additional costs of free school meals for all students, and more. 
The sheriffs’ budget allocation for fiscal 2025 is roughly $738 million. 
The governor did not provide any explanation for the $163 million proposed additional funding injection in her letter to lawmakers, but sheriffs’ departments later told the State House News Service that they faced significant cost growth as a result of salary increases, substance use disorder care, and a mandatory “no-cost calls” program that allows incarcerated individuals to communicate with loved ones free of charge. 
But lawmakers now have pointed questions about whether the math adds up. The Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association said it expects the free communication program, for example, to cost all sheriffs a combined $12.4 million in fiscal year 2025.  
As of March 30, the 13 county correctional facilities that had people in custody averaged a combined population of 7,048, less than half their combined capacity of nearly 15,000, according to a report the Sheriffs’ Association filed with lawmakers. (The Nantucket sheriff’s office did not have anyone in custody during the reporting period). 
It’s common for state offices and departments, including sheriffs, to spend beyond their budgeted appropriations and seek more funds at the end of the cycle. While closing the books on fiscal year 2024, Healey and the Legislature directed an extra $46 million to sheriffs’ offices. 
“We will continue to explore further steps to ensure appropriate oversight, achieve cost containment, and keep sheriffs’ offices on a more sustainable fiscal path in the months and years ahead,” Michlewitz and Rodrigues said. 
The bill would task the inspector general’s office with examining how sheriffs account for expenses, comply with state finance laws, and manage their spending over time. The IG would need to submit a report to lawmakers by the end of February 2026. 
Sheriffs so far do not appear interested in digging in for a public fight. 
A spokesperson for the Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association said the group and the sheriffs it represents “understand and respect the Legislature’s responsibility to ensure fiscal transparency and accountability.” 
“For years, the Sheriffs have invested in evidence-based programs that make Massachusetts a national leader in corrections and rehabilitation — especially when it comes to saving lives and improving health outcomes,” the spokesperson said. “These are proven, responsible investments in public safety and community well-being. We welcome any review that strengthens public confidence and supports our continued focus on operating safe, efficient facilities that help people rebuild their lives.” 
While she was leaving an unrelated event Tuesday, Healey did not answer a question about the Legislature seeking to investigate sheriffs’ spending. A spokesperson for the governor later said only that she would review any legislation that reaches her desk. 
The Legislature’s action drew criticism from two of Healey’s Republican challengers. Both Mike Kennealy and Brian Shortsleeve issued statements Tuesday slamming the Legislature for declining to fulfill the sheriffs’ funding request. 
“Three Democratic sheriffs are accused of corruption, and now every sheriff in the state — including those who have served with integrity — must suffer the consequences,” Kennealy said, appearing to reference the different cases involving Tompkins, McDermott and Cocchi. “The problem in Massachusetts isn’t with our sheriffs offices. It’s with the elected Democrats who have controlled every lever of power for too long. When one party holds unchecked control, corruption festers.” 
“They are using the recent scandals in three Democrat sheriff offices as a pretense to strip funding from ALL sheriffs,” Shortsleeve added in his own statement. “And while they punish law enforcement and the public by cutting public safety dollars, they make an exception to keep funding for free phone calls for convicts. They have their priorities totally upside down. Maura Healey needs to denounce these cuts immediately.” 
As is often the case, Beacon Hill power-players are moving to pack a range of unrelated spending and policy goals into the so-called closeout budget. 
The bill the House plans to take up would appropriate $236 million in payments to owners of former Steward Health Care hospitals, part of the more than $480 million in aid the Healey administration pledged last year to incentivize transfer of the facilities away from the bankrupt system.

Kennedy Jr. elevated vaccine skeptics. 
House Democrats also want to direct $8.1 million to an entity that does not often factor into midyear appropriations: the House itself, which is set to receive $49.9 million through the annual budget and in July implemented a hiring freeze.

The group made the decision Tuesday as RSVPs flooded in faster than expected, said Jamie Carter with Salt Lake Indivisible. 
“As big as this is getting, and considering, you know, what happened at the last march in the evening, we decided that safety first should probably be our top priority,” Carter said Tuesday. 
At Salt Lake City’s No Kings protest in June, innocent bystander Afa Ah Loo was shot and killed by an armed volunteer who fired into a crowd three times, Salt Lake City police said. The volunteer also managed to shoot and wound his intended target, a man carrying a rifle, according to police. Protesters in the crowd of 10,000 ran into buildings and huddled together in the chaos.

Four months later, no one has been charged in the killing of Ah Loo, a fashion designer and father of two from West Valley City. Experts have said Utah’s permissive gun laws may offer legal protection to both the shooter and the man who carried the rifle but didn’t fire it. 
Saturday’s gathering will mark the first large-scale demonstration in Salt Lake City since the shooting. It follows other shootings at recent public or political events in Utah, including the killings of three people at a festival in West Valley City in June, and the death of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in September. 
Carter said she’s spoken with people who have mixed emotions about attending the protest. 
“Some people were very hesitant, after what happened last time,” Carter said. 
Utah ‘No Kings’ organizers say governor was ‘grossly misinformed’ about peacekeeper warning

National No Kings organizers cut ties with Utah 50501, the local group behind June’s protest – which did not have a role in planning Saturday’s event, said Carter, also political director for DemCast USA. 
Safety volunteers won’t be armed and have participated in de-escalation training led by the local American Civil Liberties Union and Freedom Trainers, Carter said. Organizers are asking attendees to leave weapons at home. 
Sign-ups prior to an event typically account for just 20% of actual crowd size, Carter said, and the group received 1,700 as of Tuesday afternoon, suggesting more than 8,000 could attend the event.
That would make for about 500 protesters for every safety volunteer, Carter said, and for a march, “we did not feel that was adequate.”
“It’s a lot more of a controlled environment,” she said of the Capitol. A dance party and performances from two bands and a comedian will follow the rally, instead of a march to the City and County building.
In Washington, D.C., House Speaker Mike Johnson condemned the events scheduled for Saturday across the country as a “hate America rally.”
Carter said the Utah event’s mantra is “‘no one can steal our joy,’ and so we really want to make this a fun community experience.” She expects to see unicorn and dinosaur costumes like many have been wearing in Portland, Oregon as they have protested the presence of National Guard troops and immigration agents in the city.

Salt Lake City police are coordinating closely with event organizers, said police Sgt. Miles Southworth, “just doing what we can to have that open communication to kind of get an idea of what resources are needed and how we can help ensure this event goes safely.”
He declined to say how many officers are assigned, or whether there will be a larger law enforcement presence than at the deadly June demonstration, but said neighboring departments will be there to help. 
The Utah Highway Patrol, which provides Capitol security, will also staff the event, said spokesperson Hillary Koellner. She declined to share details, citing safety.
“Whether they are a protester or counter protester, free speech is protected,” Koellner said. “We encourage peaceful protesting.” 
Demonstrations are planned in 11 other cities across Utah, including in St. George, Moab, Kanab, Price and Fillmore.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)A group that lobbies for laws addressing poverty is continuing its “beating drum” strategy for its 2026 legislative agenda, which includes seven main priorities, where only one is new.
“We’re all united in our belief that to address poverty, we have to address policy at the State House,” Robyn Hyden, executive director of Alabama Arise, said in an interview Tuesday.
The 2026 regular session of the Alabama Legislature begins on Jan. 13.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Alabama Arise’s seven priorities are health equity, hunger relief, adequate state budgets, inclusive democracy, justice reform, tax reform and worker power. Hyden said the priorities were decided on by its 155 members that include faith-based organizations, non-profits and civic groups across the state. Worker power is the only new priority this year. 
She said that some policies, like cutting the state’s sales tax on groceries, took years of advocacy to be addressed. The same applies, she said, to the 2026 priorities, especially to Alabama Arise’s plea to expand Medicaid coverage.
“We’re not going to shut up about it,” Hyden said. “It is still possible for our state to close the health coverage gap. What we’re now seeing is the impacts of our state’s lack of investment in rural health care infrastructure and in affordable options for families is creating all these long term health impacts. So it may not come in the form of Medicaid expansion, it may be some other proposal or program that Alabama decides to do, but we do believe this has to be a top priority for Alabama.”
Alabama is one of only ten states that has not expanded Medicaid, despite calls from hospitals and studies showing expansion could bring public health and economic benefits. While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program. 
With state lawmakers up for re-election in 2026, Hyden said the issues surrounding poverty will be “front and center” for their campaigns. Federal cuts to SNAP from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will be prominent, Hyden said. Without the federal government fully funding the food assistance program, the state will have to spend an estimated $208.7 million in fiscal year 2027. 
“Lawmakers may pretend like it’s not popular to fund SNAP, but when the rubber hits the road, our state is going to have to fund SNAP or risk losing a billion dollars of federal funding coming into the state,” Hyden said.
Another issue impacted by the election year is early voting, a law that Democratic lawmakers have tried to pass since at least 2016. Hyden said that early voting could improve the state’s voter turnout, which 38.6% in the 2022 midterm election and 59% in the 2024 general election, according to election data. About 300,000 Alabamians cast mail-in ballots in 2020 after the state loosened the restrictions on absentee voting amid the COVID outbreak, but the program was not continued. 
She said that increased voter turnout, and accessibility to vote, benefits all parties. 
“Democracy is better when more people participate. There’s so many citizens who could vote, and they’re not showing up to vote,” Hyden said. “That should really be something that I hope all legislators are concerned about, especially as they’re coming to ask for our vote.”
Alabama Arise will also continue to advocate for no-cost breakfast for public schools. According to the press release, one in four Alabama children face food insecurity. Hyden said that some schools are able to offer free lunches due to a significant low-income population, but there are other schools on the edge. 
“It’s not always an economic issue. Sometimes it’s just that kids need to eat and they’re running late to school,” she said. “So it’s a very cost effective program to expand breakfast. It doesn’t really add much to their bottom line.”
Hyden estimated that free breakfast and lunch would add about $90 million to the Education Trust Fund (ETF) budget. She said Arise is focusing on only free breakfast for now, which she said is currently a $7.2 million line item for schools with a large enough low-income population.
While free breakfast would impact the ETF for schools that opt-in, Alabama Arise is also advocating for a complete elimination of the state grocery tax. 
“We know that we need that money for education, but the ETF has also had surplus over the last several years. So this is the time, if ever was the time,” Hyden said.
While Alabama Arise’s priorities may seem unachievable, Hyden said it is important to make progress where they can.
“We know that these are ambitious goals, but we also believe these are very reasonable and practical goals,” Hyden said. “I don’t think those are partisan issues. We’re out talking to everybody in all communities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Statehouse-0747-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:57:19.397220
,California,2025-10-15 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Videos could tank Katie Porter’s bid to become California’s next governor,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/katie-porter-california-governor-bid/,"As damage to some candidates' personal images harmed their presidential hopes, so too can two viral incidents torpedo Katie Porter's chances.","In the broadest sense, political campaigns resemble military operations with mission goals, strategic plans to achieve them, logistical support and tactical maneuvers to weaken opposing forces.
However, as Prussian Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke observed in 1871,“No plan of operations extends with any certainty beyond the first encounter with the main enemy forces.”
In other words, once a political campaign is launched, it can be undermined by events that even the most comprehensive strategy could not anticipate. The “X factor,” as some have dubbed it, can dominate the outcome.
Notable examples abound, including Richard Nixon’s sweaty image during his 1960 television debate with a cool and telegenic John Kennedy, the revelations about Gary Hart’s swinger lifestyle that sank his 1988 presidential campaign and, just last year, Joe Biden’s disastrous debate with Donald Trump that forced him to abandon his re-election campaign.
We may be seeing another implosion in the still-embryonic campaigns over who will succeed Gavin Newsom as governor.
After former Vice President Kamala Harris opted out and three announced candidates — Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former state Senate leader Toni Atkins and state Treasurer Fiona Ma — dropped out, former Congresswoman Katie Porter emerged as the frontrunner.
However, Porter, who lost a U.S. Senate bid last year, has just 17% in the latest polling, with rivals mired in single-digits. Meanwhile, political oddsmakers wait for two other potentials, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla and Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso, to declare their intentions.
Last week, Porter’s campaign suffered a double dose of notoriety that could be fatal — videos of her saying and doing things that undermine her carefully curated image of a single mom who holds the rich and powerful accountable.
The first was an interview with CBS reporter Julie Watts, who pressed her repeatedly about whether she would seek support from among the nearly 40% of California voters who backed Donald Trump last year.
Porter complained that Watts was asking multiple questions about the issue and threatened to end the interview if Watts persisted.
The three-minute excerpt of the interview exploded on YouTube and in social media postings, and Porter’s rivals immediately jumped in with criticism and suggestions that she drop out of the race.
That led to another video surfacing on Politico, a website devoted to politics, in which Porter, during a 2021 interview, snapped at one of her staffers who was trying to help her respond on an issue, “Get out of my f—— shot.”
When the staffer tried to explain, Porter shot back, “OK, you also were in my shot before that. Stay out of my shot.”
The Nixon, Hart and Biden incidents had massive effects on their presidential campaigns, not because they hinged on foreign policy, the economy or any other substantive issue, but because they damaged their personal images.
As the two Porter videos ping pong through the electronic universe — and are constantly repeated in television and internet ads by her rivals — they undermine her likeability, making her the issue, rather than the positions she takes to hopefully sway voters.
It’s a classic example of the X factor, one that could easily alter the gubernatorial campaign’s dynamics.
It might persuade Padilla, who acknowledges that he is weighing a bid for governor, that it’s a campaign he could win. Ditto for Caruso if he also believes that Porter’s self-inflicted wounds are fatal, as they may be.
The campaigns to succeed Newsom were already unusual, with so many potential candidates dropping in, dropping out or lounging somewhere in between scarcely a year before voters will have the last word. Porter’s image woes are still another contributor to the fluid battlefield of California politics.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/111723-CA-Dem-Day-01-MG-CM-25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court last week held oral arguments on Colorado’s prohibition of mental health practitioners trying to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of their minor patients, or what’s become known as “conversion therapy.” The high court’s conservative majority appeared sympathetic to the plaintiff challenging the law’s constitutionality on 1st Amendment grounds.
A decision overturning the ban, expected next summer, could have ramifications for Minnesota, which enacted a similar law in 2023 with bipartisan majorities.
Over 20 states have banned licensed mental health professionals from practicing conversion therapy for minor patients because it doesn’t work and contributes to increased rates of depression, suicidality and overall psychological distress, according to a a review of scientific evidence conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health, among many other researchers and major medical associations.
The court heard arguments from an evangelical counselor who says Colorado is infringing on her free speech rights because of the views she expresses during her sessions. The counselor was represented by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom.
During oral arguments, Associate Justice Samuel Alito called Colorado’s conversion therapy ban “blatant viewpoint discrimination.”
Proponents of the ban cite the harmful effects on patients and argue that states are regulating the therapeutic profession, not limiting speech. Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson made this point explicitly, questioning why the government could stop a doctor from prescribing medications but not stop a mental health provider from giving a discredited therapy that also promises conversion.
Minnesota lawmakers passed a conversion therapy ban in 2023. The Democratic-controlled Legislature passed a slew of protections for LGBTQ people, including making Minnesota a trans refuge state, over the objections of Republicans.
The conversion therapy ban stood out, however, for its modicum of GOP support.
Ten Republicans — eight in the House and two in the Senate — voted alongside Minnesota Democrats.
Rep. Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, voted for the conversion therapy ban. He said he only learned after the fact — despite two hours of debate on the bill — that it included a ban on mental health practitioners trying to change a minor’s gender identity, a provision he doesn’t support.
Still, Engen said, it’s destructive to tell a gay child that something is wrong with them.
“You’re not born broken, and if you’re gay, you’re gay,” said Engen, who is considered a rising star among Gen Z Republicans.
Rep. Roger Skraba, R-Ely, also voted for the bill in 2023. He said he didn’t feel it was right for people to tell children that who they are is wrong.
“We’re created who we are, and that’s the way it is. Just live with it. That’s who you are. To think that we can convert someone to be something else is nuts to me,” Skraba said.
Like Colorado’s law, Minnesota’s conversion therapy ban only applies to licensed mental health professionals, exempting religious groups.
Sen. Scott Dibble, who had been working to pass Minnesota’s conversion therapy ban for over 10 years prior to its 2023 passage, said the Supreme Court nullifying Minnesota’s ban would cause “extreme harm to … young people who cannot defend themselves.”
“It means we’re going to have a bunch of quacks and snake oil salesmen running around telling children that they are inherently disordered and who they are is undesirable and they should try to change themselves,” said Dibble, a Minneapolis Democrat. “When that happens, we’ll have a bunch of children living in isolation and despair and being abused by adults around them with no legal standing of their own. It’s truly horrible and very frightening.”
Dibble said he hasn’t considered a legislative response to a loss at the Supreme Court, but he said he’ll work to ensure people who practice conversion therapy aren’t taxpayer funded.
“We’re going to strenuously resist any taxpayer dollars that flow through public health plans being used to pay for it and continue to resist the ability for insurance companies to pay for this kind of torture and abuse of children,” Dibble said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Over the past two years, upwards of 18,000 young children in the Las Vegas metro area have received free monthly books in the mail as part of an early literacy program started by country icon Dolly Parton. But that ends this month.
Storied Inc., the Clark County-based nonprofit partner for Parton’s Imagination Library, last week announced to parents and guardians that its October books would be the last until additional funding for the program is secured. The program, when funded, provides a free, age-appropriate monthly book to children 0 to 5 years old.
According to Meredith Helmick, executive director of Storied, the nonprofit sought funding from the Nevada State Legislature earlier this year to keep the program going after an initial two-years of state grant funding ended, but they came up empty handed.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager sponsored a bill to appropriate $3.9 million to the United Way of Northern Nevada and the Sierra, which currently runs the Imagination Library for Washoe County residents, to expand the program statewide. The bill was referred to the Assembly Committee on Ways & Means, where it languished until the end of the regular session without a hearing or even a mention, according to the legislature’s website.
Helmick also hoped the nonprofit program might be able to secure funding through Senate Bill 460, Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro’s omnibus education legislation.
An early version of that bill appropriated $50 million for early childhood literacy readiness programs, but an amendment reduced that to $0 for the fiscal year beginning July 2025 and $12 million for the fiscal year beginning July 2026. Helmick says lawmakers chose to prioritize expansion of preschool seats, a Cannizzaro priority.
SB460 was heavily negotiated and amended to include many of Gov. Joe Lombardo’s education priorities. Those priorities included setting aside $7 million in grant funding for charter school transportation.
It appears those other priorities came at the expense of existing innovative programs that were working.
Helmick says a survey of her families last year found 62% of them had fewer than 20 children’s books in their homes before enrolling their children in the program.
“This program is such a low cost, high reward program,” she added.
Helmick is hopeful the program can return to the Las Vegas area. She says Storied is having conversations with large companies and other nonprofits, reaching out to elected officials at all levels of government, and urging their supporters to do the same.
“We’ve heard rumors of a special session,” she adds. “Can we rewrite SB460 to include the language that it took out? Are there other funds that we could add or tap into that we could fit under? Maybe that’s an avenue.”
‘It isn’t just about the books’
Meredith Helmick and her husband, Kyle, were inspired to start Storied Inc. after attempting to sign up their daughter for Imagination Library only to learn the nationwide program didn’t serve their area.

Dolly Parton launched Imagination Library in 1995 and the program has since given out more than 250 million free books to children in the United States and four other countries.
Storied Inc. is one of several partners running the program in Nevada. According to Helmick, the other partners have managed to continue their programs, either in whole or by scaling down the number of kids served.
The sheer size of Clark County’s population makes that a tougher task for Storied. According to the Imagination Library’s website, nearly 29,000 Nevada children are enrolled, the vast majority through Storied.
Helmick says that before they even had a chance to market the program or figure out stable funding, an intrepid stranger found the sign up form and shared it on a social media group for parents in Las Vegas.
“In 48 hours, we had 3,500 kids registered,” she recalls. “It was, like, ‘I guess we’re doing it now.’ But it all worked out beautifully.”
From there, the program quickly grew just by word of mouth. It was funded from June 2023 to July 2025 by a grant from the state’s Early Childhood Innovative Literacy Program. Participation fluctuates each month as kids are signed up or age out at 5 years old, but Helmick says it stays in the range of 18,000 or 19,000 thousand children spanning most of Clark County.
(Boulder City residents have a dedicated partner, Reading to Z, which currently serves fewer than 200 kids. Rural Clark County residents who live in Valley Electric Association’s service area can sign up for a program run by the energy cooperative’s charitable foundation.)
Over the summer, with the funding drying up, Storied stopped accepting new kids into the program.
“We didn’t want to disappoint families” by starting to send them books only to stop sending them a few months later, said Helmick. “One thing that sets (Imagination Library) apart is these books are sent directly to their home. I am a huge proponent of libraries. I’m there practically every week. But not everybody is able to do that. That is a barrier.”
Additionally, the books arrive addressed to the child.
“Getting it in the mail, the label with their name, it gives them ownership of the book,” says Helmick. “It makes a huge difference. I didn’t realize it until I heard it from families.”
On the inside of each book cover is a note from Imagination Library with tips for parents on conversations they can have with their child about the book, or questions they can ask to boost critical thinking and early reading skills.
“It isn’t just about the books and the words and the stories you’re reading with your kids,” said Helmick. “It’s sitting together side by side. It’s having conversations with them.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/grabbingdollybook-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

A police sergeant at the time, Fails was demoted to officer in 2010, according to salary records.   
Fails, via email, said his “actions at that time were taken to prevent what I believed could become an escalating situation involving an 18-year-old male. No individuals were injured or restrained, and the case was ultimately dismissed by the court.”
The court records didn’t provide the victim’s name. However, a Moapa Valley publication reported in Feb. 2010 that Moapa Valley High School senior Cyle Durham “beat Taylor Fails of Virgin Valley,” at a match on Feb. 13, the day of the alleged battery, according to court records. Taylor Fails is Tracy Fails’ son. 
“I remember that guy,” Durham said of the elder Fails when reached by phone. He did not respond to further inquiries.
“Tracy is known to be quick tempered and has been reprimanded throughout his career for incidents where he lost his temper,” former Chief of Police MaQuade Chesley, who was fired by the Mesquite City Council earlier this year, told the Current. Chesley is suing the department for wrongful termination.
Chesley says in 2019, he “heard yelling in the hallway. I went out and witnessed Fails yelling at an officer who was in tears. I separated the two and HR conducted an investigation,” Chesley said via text, adding Fails was required to take part in remedial training.
Fails declined to discuss the allegation, and referred the Current to the city’s Human Resources department, which did not respond to inquiries.
Mesquite requires that the chief of police have a combination of law enforcement experience and education, which could include a bachelor’s degree in a related field, such as criminal justice. Fails has a two-year associate’s degree in automotive studies.
Fails, via email, notes he has extensive experience with the department, and said he intends to complete a bachelor’s degree “in the near future, and I am scheduled to attend the FBI National Academy.”
Growing pains
Mesquite, a city of about 24,000 roughly 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was founded by Mormon pioneers in the 1880s. The population was predominantly Mormon until a building boom in the last 15 years brought thousands of retirees to the Virgin Valley community.
Although Mesquite is now the fastest growing city in Nevada, the police department and city government, according to residents, remain in the control of a ‘good old boy’ network.
The Mesquite Police Officers Association, the police union representing Mesquite officers, “is running the police department and in some sense, the city,” says Chesley, whose termination was initially attributed by former City Manager Edward Owen Dickie to the union’s vote of no-confidence.
Dickie was terminated earlier this year, after the Current reported  that he uttered a variety of racist remarks in secretly recorded audio.
“All these bullies from high school got jobs as police officers,” says former City Councilman Wes Boger. “Everybody knows who they are, and they’re running the department through the union.”
Critics of the department point to the city’s firing and rehiring of Officer Ryan Hughes, who was found to have served without ever passing background and psychology tests.
Hughes’ text messages, obtained by residents via public record requests, revealed a number of troubling statements, as well as an admission that Hughes falsified training records for his K9. The admission opens the door for the dismissal of cases with evidence seized in searches involving Hughes’ dog.
The police department, according to Mayor Jesse Whipple, deemed Hughes, under the union contract, could not lose his job for the offenses.
At a recent meeting of the Mesquite Police Officers Association, Whipple, according to an audio recording obtained by the Current, consulted with union members about their preference for chief of police, with the conversation focused on Fails. 
“The big question is, is the devil you know better than the devil you don’t?” Whipple asked. 
“And that’s kind of gonna have to be you guys’ decision.”
Whipple goes on to say he’s “polled the council four or five times on this and I’ve got four or five different outcomes every time I got it. If this is the direction you guys want to go, I think a real strong endorsement for Tracy would go a long way.”
Polling council members, known as serial communications, is a violation of Nevada’s Open Meeting Law. Whipple did not respond to the Current’s inquiries about what he asked when repeatedly polling council members.
The union has not publicly endorsed Fails for the chief’s job.
Mesquite resident Bob Muszar thinks it’s inappropriate for Whipple to counsel the union to lobby for its chosen candidate.
“In an organized, professionally run recruitment it’s not at all unusual to provide opportunities for input from employee organizations,” Muszar said via email. “But what we are experiencing here in Mesquite is the inappropriate politicization of an administrative process.”
Whipple did not respond to requests for comment on why he advised the police union how to exert its influence on behalf of Fails.
“The City Charter is clear,” says resident Muszar. “The appointment of our next chief of police is an administrative decision to be made solely by the City Manager. Neither the Mayor nor the City Council has any legitimate role in the process until the City Manager presents a candidate for Council ratification. The Mayor’s only role is to cast a tiebreaking vote should the council vote to ratify be deadlocked.”
Some residents are calling for an outsider, who may be less likely to tolerate inappropriate behavior on the part of officers, to take over the department.
City Councilwoman Pattie Gallo says she’s doubtful Fails will prevail, given his lack of education. Gallo says Mesquite should expand its horizons and recruit a police chief from outside the department. She says she’s told Whipple “we need to go outside to stop the madness.”
Boger, the former councilman, agrees. He points to the dismantling by Fails of a volunteer program established by Chesley at local schools that could not afford school resource officers as an example of the police department’s politicization.
Boger says he and a retired police officer were terminated as volunteers by Fails “for speaking out at city council meetings.” 
Fails did not respond when asked why he terminated the program.
The police department, Boger suggests, “has shown citizens would be better off with Las Vegas Metro taking over than having any of them named chief.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mesquitepolicedept-e1760463847992-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills’ first public appearance after launching her bid for U.S. Senate on Tuesday wasn’t a campaign stop, but it underscored her argument as to why she’s best fit to beat long-time Republican Sen. Susan Collins: she knows the rule of law and has a record of defending it. 
Mills gave the opening remarks for a forum titled, “Standing up for the Rule of Law: How do we save it?” to a University of Southern Maine auditorium, filled with people, many lawyers, similarly concerned about the rule of law amid growing challenges to democratic institutions. 
The governor condemned the Trump administration for punishing law firms for pursuing cases the president dislikes, an issue that led to the founding of the nonprofit that hosted the event, Maine Lawyers for the Rule of Law. 
Mills also highlighted how she’s personally fought back, reiterating her now famous “see you in court” rallying cry after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding to Maine over the state’s transgender athlete policy, which was also a prominent part of her campaign launch video. 
Mills’ U.S. Senate campaign ignites battle between establishment and grassroots Democrats

That comment was met with enthusiastic applause. But public frustration with the shortcomings of the overall opposition to the Trump administration’s continued infringements on the rule of law became palpable as the night went on. 
The speakers — Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, ACLU of Maine Legal Director Carol Garvan, Maine State Bar Association President Susan Faunce — spoke about the importance of courts as a backstop, though an imperfect one. 
However, the keynote speaker, Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman, a constitutional scholar, said the ultimate defense for a free government is the test Mills now faces: the public. 
“Public action historically has been the way that the rule of law rejuvenates itself,” Feldman said in an interview with Maine Morning Star ahead of the event. “I mean, the rule of law is not magic. It’s a set of customs, practices and culture.”
Vote. Protest. Speak to elected officials. Run for office. Of the latter, Feldman added, “Sometimes that’s what it takes. Because the system rests on our common belief that it’s okay, and if something is going on and you know it’s not okay, and you say, ‘Oh, well, it’s somebody else’s job.’ Guaranteed that the thing you think is not okay will become normalized.” 










We know that the law is neither red nor blue, it is not owned by any political party, and it is not the tool of the chief executive. The law, very simply, is the greatest achievement of our society, it is the thing that protects all of us, especially the weak and the vulnerable, those who cannot stand up for themselves.


– Maine Gov. Janet Mills


The status quo will be questioned in numerous ways in the Senate race. 
Collins is facing fierce opposition from Democrats who say she’s not doing enough to push back on Trump’s actions. Meanwhile, Mills is highlighting her extensive legal experience to show voters how she plans to resist. 
“We know that the law is neither red nor blue, it is not owned by any political party, and it is not the tool of the chief executive,” Mills said Tuesday night. “The law, very simply, is the greatest achievement of our society, it is the thing that protects all of us, especially the weak and the vulnerable, those who cannot stand up for themselves. If we stop believing in that great equalizer, the Constitution, if we give up, if we lose faith, then we lose the very thing that protects every one of us, at a time when we need it most.”

The public has also been growing frustrated with the Democratic establishment, of which Mills is a part. She was scouted by and launched her campaign with the financial backing of national Democrats, instantly upending a primary field that had been leaning toward a political novice. 
Crowds across Maine have been drawn to Democratic candidate Graham Platner because of his grassroots pitch. The oysterman and military veteran who was scouted by unions and community groups has said he’s running not just to become a senator but to build out a lasting structure for grassroots politics in the Pine Tree State. 
While Feldman shied away from commenting on Maine politics when asked about Mills’ prospects, he was direct when he said, “The first check on the executive is not the judiciary. It’s not the public. It’s Congress.” 
And when asked whether Congress is currently doing enough to uphold the rule of law, he said, “it doesn’t take a genius in political science” to observe that Congress isn’t fulfilling its functions in a robust way. 
“When it passes laws, it’s not insisting that they be enforced or insisting that the president enforce them,” Feldman said. “When he doesn’t enforce the law or when he deviates from the law, Congress is largely out to lunch or silent.”
Feldman attributed this inaction largely to looming reelection prospects. He then credited Trump and his supporters for realizing that “if you mobilize people to vote, you can make fundamental change in the society.” 
Mills hammered this point too. “Whenever and however you do stand up, believe me, you will count for more than you think,” she told the crowd.
But Mainers in attendance Tuesday night questioned their power in unprecedented times. 
“How do we, the basic people, how do we confront the federal government?” one woman asked. 
David Webbert, a civil rights lawyer in Maine who moderated the forum, responded, “One quick thing is to vote.” 
The woman rebutted with concerns about gerrymandering and a referendum on the November ballot that would make significant changes to election procedures, including requiring identification to vote and adding more restrictions to absentee voting.
This back and forth continued to no clear conclusion, but Feldman said the woman was part of the solution.  
“That’s what insisting on the rule of law is all about,” he said. “It is incremental. It is everyday work.”

(Liz Banse)Driving through the Highway 99 tunnel in Seattle could be pricier during next summer’s FIFA World Cup.
With traffic expected to surge when the city hosts several matches, the Washington State Transportation Commission may temporarily hike tolls for the two-mile tunnel to defray additional costs associated with the international sporting event.
Commissioners heard Tuesday that their staff are evaluating potential increases of 50 cents and $1 that would be imposed between June 1 and July 15, 2026, the period in which six World Cup contests are scheduled at Lumen Field in downtown Seattle. 
State lawmakers directed the commission to consider a temporary increase and use the money to cover added costs of managing traffic around the stadium and throughout the Puget Sound when fans flood the region in those six weeks.
Doing nothing is an option too, said Carl See, the commission deputy director. While commissioners need to keep in mind the impact of the influx of visitors, they also need to remember any increase “may have an impact on those who have no interest” in taking part in what will be a “monumental event” for the state, he told the panel.
The Pacific Northwest will host 13 World Cup matches — six in Seattle and seven in Vancouver, B.C. Conversations have been under way for months on how to avert monumental backups at the U.S.-Canada border and assist fans moving between the host cities.
About 750,000 people are anticipated to come to Washington state in the course of six weeks. In addition to matches, teams will be practicing at the University of Washington in Seattle and Gonzaga University in Spokane. There will be training locations and fan zones in the state, too.
State lawmakers earmarked roughly $24 million in the current transportation budget for World Cup-related expenses. Additional dollars were cribbed into the operating and capital budgets for security and field upgrades.
With transportation, there’s $14 million for transit, including $5 million for expanding intercity bus service in the state, and another $8.25 million for operational improvements aimed at keeping people moving. 
There’s $2 million for maintenance in the vicinity of the tunnel. Those dollars will come out of the tunnel toll revenue account. Lawmakers assumed that sum could be covered from a temporary toll rate increase but didn’t mandate one.
Roughly 47,000 vehicles travel through the tunnel each day based on a July 2024 analysis.
Tolls vary based on time of day with higher rates in peak commute hours and lower rates on nights and weekends. They are collected in both directions as one exits the tunnel. 
Weekdays, the cost ranges from $1.25 to $1.85 per trip with a Good to Go pass. It is $1.25 on  weekends. Drivers pay an extra 25 cents per trip with the Pay By Plate option, in which they register their license plate on a Good To Go! account without a pass. There is a $2 fee tacked on if you pay by mail.
What will be studied are potential increases of 50 cents per trip and $1 per trip that would be imposed at all times, including on weekends.
In December, staff will present the commission with projections of how much money might be generated from those assessments and how many drivers might choose to use local roads and Interstate 5 to avoid higher tolls.
See cautioned that he didn’t want to “overpromise” what data would be delivered. If approved, this would be the first such temporary toll-rate hike, he said. Given the short six-week duration and uniqueness of the sporting event, it will be hard to model for every possible factor with precision, he said.
If the commission decides to proceed with a one-time temporary toll rate increase, it would conduct a rate-setting process including gathering public input on potential rate options.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lumen-field-sounders-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

(Getty Images)I’ve always considered myself a realist more than an optimist. At times, especially now, that outlook can be challenging. Across our nation, and particularly for disenfranchised people, we are witnessing challenge after challenge. Too many short-sighted decisions are being made, decisions that will have lasting consequences — and not in ways that serve the greater good.
It is not my nature to simply accept the current state of affairs, nor is it for our board of directors and the families and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) who continue to be the core of our mission — now entering our 70th year.  
In response to this moment, The Arc of Indiana has reestablished our Blueprint for Change committee. This dedicated group, made up of people with disabilities, family members, and leaders in the disability community, is taking a hard look at the current landscape of programs and services for people with IDD. They are seeking meaningful, sustainable solutions that expand opportunities for people with IDD, even within today’s challenging climate.
One area remains a top priority: meaningful employment. People with IDD want to work. Government leaders consistently emphasize that people who can work should be working. Yet, too often, bureaucratic barriers stand in the way. We are left asking, why?



				The Arc of Indiana’s fall newsletter focuses on employment. You can read it here. 


In my 27 years with The Arc, one truth has become undeniable, never underestimate what people can do. Individuals with IDD have incredible talents and valuable skills. It is our responsibility to remove barriers and open doors, not create more barriers. 
Listening to people with IDD express their desire to work was one of the driving forces behind the creation of our Erskine Green Training Institute (EGTI). In response to a challenge from our state legislature to find a solution to employment, we built one. 
This year, we proudly celebrate EGTI’s 10th anniversary.
To date, EGTI has graduated 364 students, with 75% securing employment within eight months of graduation. Even more impressive, nearly 80% remain employed 18 months later. These numbers speak volumes about the power of quality training, real opportunities, and high expectations. Behind every statistic is a person who has gained employment, confidence, independence, and purpose.
As we mark National Disability Employment Awareness Month this October, we celebrate the value and talent people with IDD bring to the workforce. We continue to educate and empower employers to see the value of inclusive hiring, guided by the words of Randy Lewis, former Vice President of Walgreens: “Hiring people with disabilities is good business, not just good charity.”
There’s still much work ahead. We must continue building a future where people with IDD are sought out, supported, and included as valuable employees. 
As our blueprint committee continues its work, employment will remain a central focus. Because everyone deserves the chance to live, learn, work, and thrive in their community.

(Video by James Hiatt)  A Cameron Parish judge has ruled that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution when they issued a permit for a liquified gas export terminal, which has halted construction on the facility. 
The decision, reached Friday, found that the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly Energy and Natural Resources) failed to consider the environmental impacts on surrounding communities when it approved a permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility. 
The halted Commonwealth facility is one of six LNG export projects proposed, approved or operating along Cameron’s coast. Construction of the pipelines, storage tanks and shipping facilities that make up the facility would dig up or fill nearly 200 acres of wetlands and water bottoms, according to the project’s coastal use permit application.
Judge Penelope Richard cited the close vicinity of other export terminals as a factor in her decision, saying the state “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative impacts” of these facilities on climate change in the coastal zone.
“We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses,” said Anne Rolfes, director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade. “The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”
Rolfes’s organization, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network filed the suit in August 2024. 
“This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities,” said Joanie Steinhaus, ocean program director for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment”
There was no immediate response to attempts Tuesday to reach Commonwealth LNG about the court ruling. 
Another lawsuit in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the project, citing its pollution impact. The decision delayed construction for two months until a new permit reevaluated the full impact of air pollution harms. 
The state permit for Commonwealth LNG will be suspended until the Office of Coastal Management considers climate change and environmental justice concerns in its evaluation, according to Judge Richard’s ruling. The state would need to consider these additional aspects and find that impacts on the community do not outweigh the benefits of constructing another LNG export facility along Cameron’s coast in order to reissue the permit, the judge wrote in her opinion.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Flaring_neighborhood-1024x548.png,,,2025-10-15 08:02:37.799991

Carnell. Oct. 14, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceParents, former school employees and conservative advocates packed out the State Board of Education’s meeting room Tuesday, offering their opposition to a proposed update to the state’s health education standards framework, which they argued would marry sex education into the state’s health curriculum, despite requirements in state law for this instruction to remain optional. 
While the board was not scheduled to hold a vote on the standards, more than 40 individuals – including members of the far-right groups Moms for Liberty and Citizens Defending Freedom – arrived to offer their thoughts on the proposal, with more signing up to offer their comments online.
Though the updated standards had their supporters, the majority of commenters argued adopting the standards as-is would violate both state and federal law by preventing parents from opting their children out of the curriculum by weaving sex education into health education. 
Several commenters, including Republican Attorney General candidate Kevin Kijewski, pointed to Mahmoud v. Taylor, in which parents of various religious backgrounds successfully argued to the U.S. Supreme Court their religious and parental rights had been violated when they were not given notice or permitted to opt their children out of curriculum involving LGBTQ+-inclusive story books.

However, Michigan school districts are not required to use these standards. According to the Department of Education, school districts decide whether to offer sex ed and what to include. Content for sexual education is recommended by Sex Education Advisory Boards of which at least half of their members must be local parents, and the local school board must approve the content.
Under state law, parents must be notified if sex education is offered locally, must be allowed to review the materials and can opt their child out of instruction without penalty. 
Ahead of the meeting, the board of education issued a statement emphasizing that optional sex education standards would remain separate, as would local control over how or if schools use these standards. 
Regardless, several commenters took issue with standards for sexual health education for students in grades 6-8, which recommended schools:

Define gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation, and explain that they are distinct components of every individual’s identity
Explain how biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression are distinct concepts and how they interact with each other 
Explain that romantic, emotional, and/or sexual attractions can be toward an individual of the same gender and/or different gender(s), and that attractions can change over time

“These proposed standards go far beyond physical health, they cross into deeply personal and spiritual territory, normalizing behaviors that many families find harmful and contrary to their faith,” said Monica Yatooma, a Republican candidate for Secretary of State. “This is not education. It’s indoctrination. It’s an assault on family values, faith and the sacred bond between parent and child.”
State Rep. Joseph Pavlov (R-Kimball) noted that House Democrats proposed similar changes in 2024, introducing legislation to update the state’s sex ed curriculum to be “medically accurate, research-informed, inclusive and age- and developmentally appropriate.”

However, the legislation failed to receive a hearing, being introduced in the midst of a tumultuous lame duck session, with Republicans set to take control of the chamber in the new year.
Opponents of the standards repeatedly pointed to Michigan’s 44th in the nation ranking for fourth grade reading scores and 31st in the nation ranking on eighth grade math scores arguing schools should focus on improving education rather than incorporating discussions of gender and sexuality into health education. 
However, the supporters of the educational framework argued an update is long overdue, with the previous health education standards adopted in 2007. 
“This means that an entire generation of students has gone through school using outdated guidance that does not reflect what we now know about mental health, technology, vaping, healthy relationships, consent, among many other topics,” said Taryn Gal, executive director of the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health.

Christy Gibson-Marshall, the assistant principal at Oxford High School, said Michigan communities have undergone significant changes since the previous standards were adopted, pointing to the rise of social media, mobile devices, the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing school violence as some of the many factors shaping the lives of today’s students.
Gibson-Marshall acknowledged that the standards include LGBTQ+ students in discussions, which she said fosters a sense of belonging and acceptance.
Both Gibson-Marshall and Gal similarly called out the new standards’ emphasis on critical assessment skills to help them navigate the vast amount of information and misinformation presented to them through social media, in the news and on the internet.
Gal also noted that the standards do not include education on abortion, despite concerns to the contrary.

Though members of the board did not vote on the Health Education Standards, the board did consider a resolution put forth by Nikki Snyder, one of the board’s two Republican members. 
Snyder’s resolution called attention to several items within the proposed standards centered on gender, sexuality and sexual identity, arguing their inclusion goes against the Supreme Court’s decision in Mahmoud V. Taylor, though Ellen Lipton, one of eight Democrats on the board, noted the difference between the curriculum discussed in the case and the standards in front of the board. 
“I think I might be the only attorney at the table. Although I’m not a constitutional attorney, I am pretty well versed in reading cases and extracting precedent from those cases,” Lipton said. “And Mahmoud, although a fairly consequential opinion, is still based on a certain set of facts that the Maryland School Board and the Maryland district was facing, and it does, when it talks about the interweaving, it was really based on the way that the curriculum was being delivered.”
She reiterated the difference between laying out standards for education and delivering curriculum, noting the local nature of Michigan’s curriculum selection and delivery. 
The motion to adopt Snyder’s motion was rejected, with Tom McMillin, the other Republican on the board, joining Snyder as the only other vote in support. 
According to the board’s earlier statement, Michigan Department of Education staff is reviewing the written public comments on the proposal and will recommend updated health education standards to the board at a future meeting.

Phil Murphy despite advances in solar and some other renewables during his two terms.,"Gov. Phil Murphy bet a lot on offshore wind projects that never materialized. His critics say he had no ""plan B."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)As Gov. Phil Murphy’s time in office nears its end, his renewables-heavy energy goals are receiving mixed reviews.
Though Murphy presided over a broad expansion of solar power in New Jersey, his greater plans to produce thousands of megawatts in offshore wind generation ultimately failed to create any new power, even as some existing power plants were shuttered, reducing the electricity New Jersey sends to its multi-state grid despite increasing generation within state borders.
Murphy’s energy goals were always ambitious. In successive pronouncements, the governor called for New Jersey to draw 100% of its energy from clean sources, first by 2050 and then by 2035. But most of those goals were never memorialized in law. Murphy, a Democrat, is leaving office in January after two terms while the two front-runners to replace him, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill, pan his energy policies on the campaign trail.
Jeff Tittel is a former longtime director of the New Jersey Sierra Club who has both allied with and criticized the governor.
“He really never did the follow-through. He did the splash, everybody applauded him, and then there was very little follow-through,” Tittel said.

The state first solicited bids for offshore wind farms in September 2018, just months into Murphy’s first term. The problems began nearly two years later with the pandemic, when a series of supply chain disruptions spurred by COVID-19 restrictions ballooned project costs.
Ørsted, the Danish wind giant tapped to build more than 3,300 megawatts of offshore generation, pulled back from the projects in 2023, saying supply chain constraints, inflation, and growing borrowing costs made them unfeasible.
“He bet heavily on wind — and I’ll get some environmentalists mad at me — but the wind program got too big, too expensive, and they got too greedy, the wind companies, and it collapsed,” said Tittel. “He bet everything on wind, and he lost.”
Shell New Energies, a 50-50 partner in Atlantic Shores projects that would add 4,310 megawatts in offshore wind capacity, in January made a similar withdrawal only days after President Donald Trump retook the White House and issued an executive order pausing leasing and permitting for offshore wind projects.
The state Board of Public Utilities in August rescinded its contract with Atlantic Shores, the lone project with leases and permits in hand, at the developer’s request. The developer sought to rebid in the state’s latest round of wind solicitations to secure better financial terms, but regulators canceled the call for proposals, citing in part federal uncertainty.
The Murphy administration dismisses the idea that it focused too much on wind energy. Eric Miller, executive director of its climate action and green economy office, noted other states on and off of PJM’s grid faced similar rate increases, regardless of their energy mix. PJM Interconnection is a regional transmission organization that provides power to New Jersey and 12 other states.
“Certainly, we leaned in on offshore wind as a new industry, but I wouldn’t say all the eggs were in that basket by any means, and I don’t think there’s data that supports the position that New Jersey leaning in on offshore wind somehow led to any problems that we’re having at the moment,” Miller said.
Mammoth energy demands from AI data centers proposed along the grid have pushed electricity capacity prices to new highs, spurring large increases to ratepayer bills after years of largely static electricity demand.
Those increases have become a focal point for Murphy’s would-be successors, who have made energy policy a cornerstone of their campaign platforms. Sherrill has pledged to freeze electricity rates for a year if elected, while Ciattarelli has said he would ban offshore wind farms and pursue a more diverse energy mix.

The amount of power New Jersey supplies to the grid run by PJM fell over Murphy’s tenure despite increases to the state’s overall generation, according to a New Jersey Monitor review of state and federal energy data.
Roughly 2,914 megawatts in grid generation were retired under Murphy through the end of August. Since the start of Murphy’s first term in 2018, New Jersey has added 1,417 megawatts in grid generation, meaning the grid saw a net loss of about 1,500 megawatts from New Jersey over the governor’s time in office.
About 80% of the retired generation came from fossil plants. The shuttering of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station and termination of a handful of low-generation solar projects accounted for the rest of the losses.
Republicans have pointed to the closures in their bids to lay blame for rising electricity prices at Murphy’s feet, though his predecessor, Chris Christie, was responsible for some of them.
Oyster Creek closed 10 years early in 2018 under a deal reached by Christie’s administration that allowed Exelon Generation, its then-owner, to avoid building new cooling towers to meet state environmental standards.
BL England, a coal and petroleum plant that shuttered in April 2019, did so under an agreement reached under Christie. Doomed efforts to repower the plant using natural gas continued through the first 14 months of Murphy’s time in office.

Shuttering plants without replacement generation in hand would put upward pressure on prices, according to Matt Hale, an associate professor of political science at Seton Hall University, who said New Jersey may have been better served by pursuing natural gas conversions like those seen in Pennsylvania and, to a lesser degree, New York.
Hale last month released a study examining a decade of energy policy in New Jersey and neighboring states, one that concludes New Jersey did not create a “plan B” that would have mitigated any failures to increase its renewable and clean energy capacity.
“Instead of looking at renewables or not renewables, the better policy would’ve been ‘let’s get rid of the worst.’ Let’s get rid of coal, but in a transition period, let’s turn those coal plants into natural gas so we have that power,” Hale told the New Jersey Monitor.
Hale’s research was funded by the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 825, a supporter of natural gas projects.
A little under half of New Jersey’s grid generation retired under Murphy came from natural gas plants, though in some cases those plants were decades or even half a century old. In some cases, plants closed because their power was too costly to bid into the capacity market before the recent spate of increases.
“What happened in New Jersey with resources retiring due to economics was common in the entire PJM region, where we saw old economic resources go offline, largely due to record low capacity pricing,” Miller said.
Of the new power generation seen under Murphy, 760 megawatts came from natural gas plants that went into operation early in his tenure, while the remainder came from solar and battery storage projects. The state also has two gas plants in Bayonne and Linden whose 1622 megawatts are sent to New York’s single-state grid.
It’s not clear whether New Jersey could compel those producers to keep their power on PJM’s grid under the deregulated generation market the state created in 1999. Some legislators have raised re-regulation as an option to control rising prices.
Murphy did attempt to maintain the rest of the state’s nuclear power supply. In 2018, he signed legislation that extended roughly $300 million in subsidies, called Zero Emission Credits, to the state’s remaining nuclear plants.
New Jersey ratepayers paid for those subsidies at the cost of about $70 each year, and they were approved over objections from environmentalists — a key Murphy constituency — who said the plants did not need the money to stay operational, as their owners claimed.
State regulators sunset Zero Emission Credits in June. By that time, they had been supplanted by federal production credits approved under President Joe Biden.
Miller said it is impossible to know whether Zero Emission Credits could have sunset sooner, though he defended the administration’s support, pointing to discussions to restart generation at Three Mile Island and Oyster Creek to meet data centers’ energy demands.
“I think the important part is our subsidies led us to a point where the fleet in Salem never went down, which is very valuable, and while on the margins maybe they could have come off a year earlier or so, we’re pretty confident the right decision was made,” he said.
Nuclear plants in South Jersey still account for roughly 40% of the state’s energy generation.










In a lot of ways, the reason New Jersey is a net importer is because it is often — not always — cheaper to make electricity outside of New Jersey.


– Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University


Overall generation in New Jersey increased under Murphy, despite declines in the energy that the state sends to the grid, chiefly because of rapid growth in the solar power delivered through behind-the-meter projects that do not plug into the grid, first through rooftop solar and later through community solar projects.
The state added 3,159 megawatts in solar generation through state incentive programs under Murphy, though that electricity overwhelmingly stayed off the grid. Just 16% of New Jersey’s 5,221 megawatts of generation goes to the grid, including 531 megawatts that went in under Murphy, according to federal data.
That distribution means the economic benefits of solar have spread unevenly: Those able to install them on their roofs or to participate in a community solar program saw lower rates, but the lack of new grid generation did little to constrain growing capacity prices.
The community solar program includes a requirement that half of its members be low- or moderate-income residents.
Murphy this summer signed bills that directed regulators to secure an additional 5,000 megawatts in community solar and battery storage generation.
“Our policies have made it significantly easier to access clean energy — helping bring solar energy and electric vehicles to more families and businesses than ever before, in addition to bringing online new sources of electricity following the market-led loss of capacity in states across the region,” said Murphy spokeswoman Stella Porter.
Some critics have pointed to New Jersey’s increasing energy imports as a source of price increases. But while importing electricity from out of state may lead to marginally higher transmission costs, capacity prices that are responsible for recent increases are set along the entirety of PJM’s 13-state market.
The state’s density, combined with a comparative dearth of open space and higher labor costs, mean standing up generation in New Jersey is more expensive than in other states on the grid, and requiring New Jersey to obtain all of its energy in-state rather than opportunistically buying wherever prices are low would increase costs, said Abe Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who studies energy regulation.
“The beauty of electrons is they don’t care about political party, and they don’t particularly care about state borders,” Silverman said. “In a lot of ways, the reason New Jersey is a net importer is because it is often — not always — cheaper to make electricity outside of New Jersey.”

That day, Missouri lawmakers held two hearings on anti-LGBTQ+ bills (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).When Missourians vote next year on whether to outlaw most abortions, they will also decide whether the state constitution should include a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.
Such a move — placing prohibitions on certain procedures for transgender children in the state’s constitution — would be unprecedented in the United States and likely impossible to reverse.
The debate is playing out while a lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the state’s current ban, along with an ongoing investigation by the state attorney general into medical clinics offering gender-affirming care.
 
 

 
Missourians’ access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones wasn’t always so fraught.
Gender-affirming care bans were not proposed in Missouri until 2020, when two state representatives filed bills seeking to bar those under 18 from accessing medical and surgical transitions. 
The full House and Senate didn’t even debate the idea until 2023 — and only after national attention came crashing down on a St. Louis clinic.
At the start of that year, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who has since left office to become co-deputy director of the FBI, launched an investigation into pediatric gender-affirming care. At the root of the probe was an affidavit from Jamie Reed, a former social worker at the Washington University Transgender Center who alleged the center was rushing children into puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones without mental health care.
Two days after signing the affidavit, Reed’s story became national news when it was published by The Free Press, a website founded by Bari Weiss, who was recently named editor-in-chief of CBS News.
The story went off like a bomb in Missouri politics, and within a week a state Senate committee was discussing it as justification to ban access to certain procedures for transgender minors. That ban quickly was passed into law, along with a ban on transgender athletes competing according to their gender identity, and signed by then-Gov. Mike Parson.  
Patients who received care at the Transgender Center are still fighting the claims made in Reed’s 2023 article. And the clinic, which saw over a thousand patients over the course of five years, stopped providing medical care to minors because of the fallout caused by Reed’s story.
The attorney general’s investigation, which includes inquiries into other gender-affirming care providers, is ongoing even as Bailey was replaced last month by Republican Catherine Hanaway. 
Prior to becoming attorney general, Hanaway served on the Washington University Board of Trustees. Upon taking office, she stepped down from the board and recused herself from the office’s investigation, her spokesperson told The Independent.
Solicitor General Lou Capozzi, who is leading the investigation alongside Deputy Attorney General Jeremiah Morgan, said in a statement that he is “committed to continuing our investigation into the center.”
“Although we are grateful the Washington University Transgender Center has shut down and is no longer performing gender transition services on minors,” he said, “there must be accountability for past actions.” 
The Transgender Center has not completely shuttered but specifies on its webpage that it only treats those 18 and older. The scope of the attorney general’s investigation is unclear, with three active lawsuits determining the amount of information that physicians are obligated to turn over.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/020723_CaseyPick2-1-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

The Wisconsin State Senate met for a floor session for the first time in over 90 days, advancing bills that would ban cellphones in schools, require coverage of breast cancer screenings for women at high risk and allow candidates to remove themselves from ballots. 
Ahead of the session, Senate Democrats criticized their Republican colleagues for the sparse number of floor days and for the issues they chose to take up. 
“We are feeling the effects of the big, ugly bill on our families, our farmers and our neighbors who need food assistance or who are covered by Medicaid,” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. She was referencing the federal law approved over the summer that made cuts to the SNAP and Medicaid programs to help pay for tax cuts. “So what is the Republican agenda today? Nothing that addresses any of those concerns. The fact that some Republicans are here at all in this building is pretty unusual.” 
The Democrats displayed a poster that showed the number of times the Senate has met per legislative session from 2003 to 2025. Tuesday was the first time the Senate has been on the floor since July, when lawmakers passed the current state budget.

During the current two-year session, the Senate has held seven floor sessions. In 2019, the Senate met 13 times on the floor. 
“We are on the path to become one of the least active state Senates in Wisconsin’s history. It’s irresponsible and reckless, but this is the Republican majority,” Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) said, adding that Tuesday also marks the 14th day of the federal government shutdown.
According to WISN 12, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) has said there is enough funding for WIC and FoodShare benefits through October, but those programs will face shortfalls if the shutdown continues into November. Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers has said he would consider  taking executive action if the shutdown continues.
“Congressional Republicans are refusing to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that would prevent Wisconsinites from seeing their monthly insurance premiums doubled next year,” Drake said. “There is not one item on our calendar today aimed at making health care more affordable for Wisconsinites or to lower costs for Wisconsin families.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said that compared to the Assembly, the Senate typically takes up a larger schedule of bills when it comes in. The Assembly has met three times this fall. 
“All they do is critique process and complain about things,” LeMahieu said of his Democratic colleagues. “But we’re getting bills done.” 
LeMahieu added that the Senate is going to meet in November, January, February and March before the end of the legislative session. Legislators will “keep looking at different things” to address gaps caused by the federal government shutdown, he added.
Cellphone ban bill
The Senate voted 29-4 to concur in a bill that will require school districts across the state to adopt a cellphone ban policy. The four opposing votes came from Democrats.
Under AB 2, school districts’ policies would need to ban cellphones during instructional times. School boards would be required  to implement the new policy by July 2026 and would need to include exceptions for emergencies, for educational purposes and cases involving student health care, individualized education plans (IEPs) or 504 plans (learning environment accommodations). 
“These are devices that are taking away from our kids’ learning, and folks are asking us to do something about it,” Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton) said at a press conference ahead of the session.
A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 89% of voters support banning cellphones during class periods. The poll also found that 72% of voters support banning cellphones throughout the school day, including lunch and between classes. 
“Wisconsin wants this. Wisconsin is asking for this,” Cabral-Guevara said on the floor. 
According to NPR, at least 31 states and Washington D.C. had adopted a cellphone ban as of September. 
According to a recent Wisconsin Policy Forum report, cellphone policies vary widely across the state, though most school districts already restrict student cellphone usage to common areas. 
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) listed a number of concerns about the bill, including whether the bill would impede parents’ ability to communicate with their children when there are safety concerns and would hinder local control. 
“Why are we, the state, worried about taking away kids’ cellphones before we enact legislation that prevents kids from having access to guns and prevents mass shootings?” Ratcliff asked. “While I understand the intent behind this bill, which is to reduce distraction in the classroom, we cannot ignore the profound and tragic reality of our current times. This measure, though well-meaning, would be a dangerous step backward in ensuring the immediate safety of our children, especially in the wake of recent horrific shootings.”
Cabral Guevara noted that the bill includes an exception for emergencies. 
The bill passed the Assembly in February, so it will now go to Evers’ desk.
Lawmakers also concurred in AB 5, which would implement new requirements for allowing residents to inspect textbooks, curriculum or instructional materials. 
Wisconsinites currently have the ability to submit open records requests to school districts to receive school materials. Under the bill, school districts would need to comply with requests within 14 days and textbooks would need to be listed online. 
This is the third session where lawmakers have pursued this policy. The 2023-25 version of the bill passed the Assembly, but never received a vote in the Senate. The 2021-23 version was vetoed by Evers. 
The current iteration of the bill passed the Assembly earlier this year.
Breast cancer screening coverage
Lawmaker advanced a bill that would require health insurance policies to provide coverage for diagnostic breast examinations and for supplemental breast screening examinations for an individual who has dense breast tissue. It would require that coverage include no patient cost-sharing.
The bill, SB 264, passed 32-1. Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) was the lone opposing vote. 
According to KFF, breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. According to the American Cancer Society, women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of breast cancer. Dense breast tissue can also make it harder for radiologists to see cancer on mammograms. 
Cabral-Guevara said she started work on the bill when a constituent of hers, Gail Zeamer, came to her about the issue. Previous versions have failed two times before. 
Zeamer was diagnosed with cancer at a late stage. She had dense breast tissue and didn’t receive additional screening. She battled cancer for eight years and passed away in June 2024 at the age of 56.
During the press conference, Cabral-Guevara said that “40% of the women in Wisconsin have dense breasts… if you’re one of those 40%, you do need a secondary screening to be truly covered to determine if you do not have breast cancer.” 
“In memory of Gail, who has passed, as well as all the other women that have been affected by breast cancer living as well as deceased,”  she added,  “this bill is a true testament that we can work together here in this Capitol building and get things done.” 
Wisconsin already requires that insurance policies provide coverage for two mammograms for women between the ages of 45 and 49 and annual screenings for women over the age of 50. Insurance companies are not required to cover additional screenings for women with dense breast tissue or at higher risk. 
Speaking in favor of the bill, LeMahieu shared that his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and she has dense breast tissue. He said they have been on a journey to deal with the diagnosis. 
“There are people who don’t know their risk that they have dense breast tissue. They don’t know that a simple mammogram might not catch it. Fortunately, she did her research,” LeMahieu said. “My wife is the exact type of person this bill is intended to help.”
The bill is now in the Assembly where the Health, Aging, and Long-Term Care Committee is scheduled to have a public hearing on it Wednesday. 
Allowing candidates to remove their name from ballots
The Senate also concurred in AB 35 in a 19-14 vote. The bill would make it easier for candidates to remove their names from ballots in Wisconsin. Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) joined Republicans in favor.
Lawmakers introduced the bill after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was not allowed to remove himself from the Wisconsin presidential ballot in 2024 after he dropped out and endorsed President Donald Trump. Currently, candidates can only have their names removed if they are dead. 
Sens. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) proposed adding additional language so that the law would only apply if someone hadn’t been bribed to get out of a race. 
“There are instances in our recent past where candidates have been taken aside and promised positions if they agree to drop their candidacy, so if we want to make sure we have the integrity of free and fair elections without the interference of corrupting influence. This is one small step in that,” Larson said. 
His amendment was voted down by Republicans. 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said he has similar concerns about someone being pressured out of a race and also concerns about how the withdrawal mechanism would practically work. 
“Once [a] primary is done and somebody has won and their name is going to be printed on the general election ballot, if you take their name off, then you have now denied voters potentially a choice between one of the two parties, and there’s no mechanism in this bill to actually replace that party’s nominee on the ballot,” Spreitzer said. “If there were such a mechanism — and other states have that — I’d be open to something like this, but here, there could be a situation where a safe Democratic seat or a safe Republican seat ends up without a name.”
Candidates withdrawing from national or statewide races would have to pay the Wisconsin Elections Commission a $1,000 fee. Non-statewide candidates would need to pay $250. Under the bill, a person would face a Class G felony with a maximum penalty of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years if they intentionally filed a false statement withdrawing a person’s candidacy. 
Other bills advanced by the Senate: 

SB 214, which would allow health care providers with a credential from another state to provide telehealth care services in Wisconsin. It passed 18-15 along party lines and will now go to the Assembly. 
AB 39, which would require state employees to return to in-person work for at least 80% of their time, passed 17-16 with Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) joining Democrats against it. It passed the Assembly in September and will now go to Evers. 
AB 162, which would require state agencies to collect a series of metrics on training and workforce development programs, including the unemployment rates and median earnings of participants six months after they graduate from a program. The Senate concurred along party lines. It now goes to Evers.
AB 168, which would allow felony fraud claims related to unemployment to be prosecuted up to eight years after a crime was committed, passed along party lines. The  current statute of limitations is six years.
AB 169, which would allow an employer to report to the Department of Workforce Development an unemployment recipient who declines or fails to show up to a job interview or declines a job offer. A report could be used to determine benefits. It will now go to Evers.

(Screenshot/WisEye)During an Assembly floor session in which most of the bills passed on voice votes that were unanimous or nearly so, the chamber’s Democrats took the occasion Tuesday to make pointed arguments with amendments that were quickly quashed.
Republican lawmakers lashed back with accusations of politics and grandstanding, while Democrats retorted that they were raising issues relevant to their constituents that the GOP majority has ignored.
On a bill that includes a pilot program for enabling video communications between callers and public safety call centers, Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) offered an amendment to restrict the video recordings from being shared.
“My amendment tightens the guardrails on the pilot program to clarify that no real-time video could be shared with private contractors or masked federal agents with ICE or any other actors not relevant to the incident being reported,” Phelps told lawmakers.
In recent door-to-door visits with constituents, “most of them have been saying they want to protect and expand Medicaid, public schools, they’re worried about the economy,” he added. “Zero percent said that they want more government surveillance.”
The amendment was rejected 54-42.
The official theme of the day — set as always by the Republican caucus — revolved around public safety, and was cued up with the first hour set aside to honor first responders from each of the state’s 99 Assembly districts.
On the floor, the Assembly passed bills to ban gadgets that can automatically hide or swap out a driver’s license plate (SB 66); increase the penalties for impersonating police, fire fighters and other emergency service personnel (AB 136); punish people who harass search and rescue dogs (AB 239); increase the penalty for human trafficking (AB 265); and require drivers to move over for disabled vehicles on the highway just as they must already give a wide berth to a stopped emergency vehicle (AB 409).
The body also concurred — on a voice vote and without debate — with a Senate bill that split lawmakers on party lines in the 2023-24 legislative session and was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers.
The legislation, SB 25, would shield police officers involved in the fatal shootings of civilians from judicial investigations under Wisconsin’s John Doe law if prosecutors decline to issue charges unless new evidence is produced. The bill passed a divided Senate in March.
Amendments as talking points
On Tuesday, disagreement only broke open when Democrats used the amendment process to highlight some of their policy priorities that weren’t otherwise up for discussion.
Each time, Rep. Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca), filling in in the speaker’s chair, ruled the amendments out of order, and the Assembly Republicans agreed in party-line votes.
The first of the Democratic amendments was on SB-183, which came to the Assembly after passing the Senate earlier Tuesday.
The legislation increases the Medicaid reimbursement for emergency medical services when drivers arrive to pick up a patient but the person ends up forgoing a trip to the hospital.
Rep. Alex Joers (D-Waunakee) offered an amendment to increase the state budget by $69.2 million to offset increases in the state’s cost to run the federally funded FoodShare program.
Rule changes that Republicans enacted in the tax-cut and spending-cut megabill that President Donald Trump signed July 4 set an “impossible standard” for Wisconsin to meet, he said. “We want to prevent another multi-million dollar heist by Trump and his followers.”
When the vote came on the bill itself — which passed by a unanimous voice vote — the bill’s Assembly author, Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) angrily scolded the Democrats.
“I’m a little bit taken back by the amendment that was thrown on to this bill,” Kurtz said. “I understand you want to get your political points, that’s fine. But there’s other bills you can do that with. This was a disrespect to those first responders that were here today.”
The next bill to get that treatment was SB 309, giving dispatchers and 911 call center operators immunity from any civil liability if they transfer a caller to the national 988 suicide and crisis line. That bill also passed with a unanimous voice vote.
First, however, state Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) proposed an amendment to restore $25 million a year for the current two-year budget that would go to municipalities to improve or expand their EMS operations. The money was included in Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal but removed by the Joint Finance Committee’s Republican leaders.
“Today, you have the opportunity to change that and do the right thing and make sure municipalities get the money they need to fund these essential services,” Fitzgerald said. The Assembly voted 54-42 against the amendment. 
Raising Epstein
A few bills later came SB 76, requiring prosecutors to get a judge’s approval before dismissing or amending charges for a broad group of crimes. That bill passed on a 53-43 party-line vote, with only Republican support.
There was no discussion of that bill’s content, however. Instead, Democrats offered an amendment requiring the governor to issue a formal notice calling for the release of the federal files on deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
Even before Epstein’s name was uttered in the chamber, Majority Leader Rep. Tyler August (R-Walworth) launched a broad verbal attack on the Democrats.
As with the other amendments, August raised a “point of order,” objecting to the amendment’s relevance to the legislation. He accused Democrats of “political gamesmanship” and pursuing “gotcha votes” to embarrass Republicans, and charged that “they just flat-out lie” in political campaigns.
“And so this is just another embarrassing moment for Assembly Democrats,” August said. “And then they wonder why they’re never going to be in charge of this place.”
Rep. Clint Anderson (D-Beloit) retorted just as sharply.
“You know what’s embarrassing is getting mad about us talking about holding a pedophile accountable,” Anderson said. “I think it is time that we send a message that we think no matter how powerful, how wealthy, and how politically connected you are, you will be held accountable if you traffic children.”
Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) speaks in favor of amending a Wisconsin bill to include language calling for the release of the Epstein files. (Screenshot/WisEye)
Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) argued that the amendment was relevant because the original bill was about restricting deferred prosecution.
“We all just voted unanimously to increase penalties for human trafficking and extend the statute of limitations,” Snodgrass said. “You simply cannot vote for that and then vote down this amendment.”
When Rep. Randy Udell (D-Fitchburg) began recounting some of the names of Epstein’s reported victims, Petersen interrupted.
“How do any of these names relate to Wisconsin?” Petersen said.
Udell: “They are all victims of Epstein and these files should be released.”
Petersen: “Did they happen in Wisconsin?”
Udell (who represents the 47th Assembly District): “We don’t know. The files haven’t been released.”
Petersen: “Representative from the 47th, on the point of order — not on national politics.”

Allowing a free-ranging nonnative species to roam a massive, unfenced area that includes millions of acres of private land has led to widespread dissatisfaction and decades of litigation. Are any solutions in sight?
The post Gridlocked: In Wyoming’s Red Desert, the checkerboard has fueled a wild horse stalemate appeared first on WyoFile .","A dozen or so wild horse advocates and photographers were gathered on a ridgeline near White Mountain in August 2024 when news started spreading that federal land managers got the OK from the courts to eliminate two entire herds, and part of another, from 2.1 million acres of the Red Desert. Cheyenne resident and amateur photographer Robyn Smith was immediately bummed. “Argh, oh crap,” she said. “That’s a lot of horses.” More than 3,000 horses, U.S. District Court of Wyoming Judge Kelly Rankin had ruled, could go. 
The group of activists was gathered to oversee an unrelated horse roundup in the so-called checkerboard region of southwest Wyoming, a 40-mile-wide swath of land where one-square-mile blocks of private and Bureau of Land Management property meet at the corners. Fences are few in the region, so thousands of horses pass on and off the private land daily. These walkabouts, and the underlying land ownership pattern, have proven a land management quagmire that has been the source of a half century of conflict, despite sporadic coordination.

Rankin’s ruling in favor of horse removal was just the latest development in the debate over whether and how many mustangs should be allowed to roam the checkerboard. The back and forth involves woolgrowers and cattle ranchers who don’t want the free-roaming horses on their private land; the BLM, an agency that’s required by the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act to maintain them on the federal property; and wild horse advocates, who want to protect the animals and health of the herds. 
Some 14 months later, however, the herds slated for elimination were still there. They’d even grown larger. The reason is litigation, which has dominated the 54 years since horses in the Red Desert became federally protected. As herd sizes continuously exceed goals, frustrations have grown. But middle-ground solutions have failed to gain traction as the camps in the checkerboard horse dispute have become gridlocked, leaving today’s land managers and horses at an impasse.
Before 1971, when the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act passed, ranchers in the checkerboard who run cattle and sheep as a collective under the Rock Springs Grazing Association took wild horse management into their own hands. “They removed excess numbers, and at that time they went to slaughter, for the most part,” says Christi Chapman, who’s a longtime wild horse advocate. She co-founded the all-volunteer Wyoming Wild Horse Improvement Partnership. “They did a good job, because they cared about the land and they wanted to have enough room for their livestock. But they liked the horses — they didn’t want to see them go completely away.”

After the Wild Horse Act passed, management shifted to federal officials. The law protects free-roaming horses from “capture, branding, harassment, or death,” prohibits commercial sale for slaughter, and declares them “living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West.” It passed both chambers of Congress unanimously and was shepherded by the matriarch of wild horse advocacy, Velma Johnston, who was known as Wild Horse Annie.
At that time, wild horses and burros roamed free on roughly 54 million acres of federal land, mostly BLM property. The new federal law didn’t demand blanket protections for equines everywhere. Land managers inventoried the West, looking at factors like vegetation and water, and ultimately defined 179 “herd management areas” covering nearly 32 million acres in 10 states where the landscape was considered able to sustainably support horses. In another 20-million-plus inhabited acres, free-roaming horses weren’t thought of as practical long-term residents because of habitat constraints or resource scarcity — these were labeled “herd areas” and are not managed for horses. In southwest Wyoming’s Red Desert and Green River Basin, nine HMAs were established, some of which included hundreds of square miles of the checkerboard. 
A key provision of the Wild Horses and Burros Act instructs agencies to “remove stray wild horses from private lands as soon as practicable” when asked by landowners, who are prohibited from removing or destroying horses on their own. That made the broad swath of interchanging public and private land that forms the checkerboard tricky, and negotiations essential. Shortly after it passed, members of the Rock Springs Grazing Association met with Johnston and the BLM to discuss management for horse herds in the region. In the new era, the association had plenty of incentive to work with the BLM to keep horse numbers in check. Their livestock depended on the same rangeland and would have to compete for forage with the free-roaming horses, which can reach 1,000 pounds and face little predation. “They had a great conversation,” Chapman says. They even came to terms on population targets. 
But the horses thrived and grew in the absence of rancher management — unchecked, herds can swell by 20% annually. The association’s ranchers tried to get the BLM to step in with large roundups to no avail, and by the late 1970s, they sued. A negotiated legal settlement came out of it, and that deal was for four herds totalling no more than 1,600 animals in the Red Desert region. 
“BLM-Wyoming complied without delay, but it took from 1980 to 1985 to reduce the number of horses from almost 7,000 to 1,600,” Rock Springs Grazing Association Manager Don Schramm testified to Wyoming lawmakers in 2023. The herds had sprawled across the landscape and gathering them was difficult and costly — as was finding a home for them, because the free-roaming animals could no longer be killed.

Horse populations fluctuated in the two decades that followed. Roundups would drive numbers down to near the 1,600-animal target, but then years would go by. “They would double by the time of the next roundup,” Schramm said in his testimony. “We did our best. We had the support of the state, BLM, wild horse interest groups, the Washington office employees, administrative officers and RSGA. It was a team effort.” But it wasn’t enough, and the wild horses spent far more time above the agreed-upon population limits than near or below the threshold. 
“I will say this: I feel like it’s not the BLM’s fault,” Chapman says. She pinpointed two reasons, naming constant litigation and a lack of resources for federal land managers to carry out their horse-removal duties. Wild horse management has proven to be an extraordinary drain on BLM coffers. Roundups, which rely on helicopters and big teams of wranglers, are pricey, but most of the expense goes toward paying for the horses to live out their days. Some rounded-up mustangs are adopted and domesticated, but most end up in long-term corrals and in off-range pastures where board, feed, and veterinary bills cost more than $100 million annually. 
Finally, in 2010, frustrated ranchers revoked their consent to tolerate horses on private land in the checkerboard, asking that the herds be removed entirely. The BLM went along, citing the act, and even sought to remove herds from the public land squares interspersed throughout the checkerboard. This would have been an almost unprecedented move. While roundups eliminating horses from the “herd areas” are somewhat routine, the designated herds have remarkable staying power.
“BLM has only zeroed out a herd two times in history,” says Bill Eubanks, an attorney who has represented horse advocacy plaintiffs in the Red Desert dispute for over a decade. The Colorado and Nevada herds that were eliminated faced dire straits from a landscape that lacked enough resources for their survival. Animals were “emaciated,” Eubanks says, and federal law explicitly permits removing herds “in order to preserve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance” in areas. “The agency ultimately documented that they could not keep a genetically viable, self-sustaining wild horse herd,” Eubanks says, “because it was just impossible.” 
The rationale for getting rid of the Red Desert herds was starkly different. It hinged on the grazing association asserting its rights to have stray wild horses removed from private lands as soon as possible, and the assumption that herd elimination was the only reasonable way to do that in the checkerboard.

The association sued BLM again three years later, generating another settlement agreement. This one called for eliminating horses in two herds and shrinking two others. Wild horse advocacy groups, represented by Eubanks, got involved with their own lawsuit, arguing violations of the Wild Horse Act, National Environmental Policy Act and other federal laws. After a federal district court defeat, the horse advocates prevailed when the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2016 that the federal agency broke the law by treating the entire checkerboard as if it were private property. 
Appellate Judge Monroe McKay and the court acknowledged the “practical realities of the checkerboard” and the need for BLM to find a “workable solution,” but still faulted the agency for ignoring a key provision of the act. “It seems to me that the only way the BLM can ultimately lawfully achieve its [ecological balance] duty to maintain wild herds and prevent destruction of viability caused by over grazing on public lands is to go back to step one and make appropriate judgments by redetermining the HMAs without the non-permissive use of private lands,” McKay wrote. 
While the BLM went back to the drawing board, the herds kept steadily growing. In the winter of 2022-’23, the federal agency commissioned an infrared aerial survey that found roughly 4,700 horses in the Red Desert herds. Roundups followed and a similar assessment at the end of 2024 found just shy of 3,700 animals. 
Around the West, the pace of roundups has long been inadequate to keep up with population growth, in some areas resulting in ecological harm rather than ecological balance. As of spring 2025, the number of free-roaming horses and burros nationwide was approaching 75,000 —  nearly triple the BLM’s targeted numbers. Nevada, which hosts nearly half of them, has been the poster child of feral horse overpopulation run amok, and its state biologists have reported that the equines eat more forage than all the native ungulate species, like elk and mule deer, combined. 
Impacts on wildlife have also been documented in Wyoming. A University of Wyoming-led research team examined how free-roaming horses influence sage grouse and found evidence that overpopulated Red Desert herds are hurting the imperiled birds’ survival rates by breaking up sagebrush, increasing bare ground and denuding watering holes. Wildlife managers on the Wind River Indian Reservation, which isn’t subject to the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act, reported dramatic, almost overnight changes after rounding up nearly 8,000 horses in 2022 and 2023. “It was at an ecological crisis point,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Supervisory Biologist Pat Hnilicka said at the time. “If something wasn’t done, there was no turning back.”

In the Red Desert, near where her family ranches, Chapman has seen feral horses eat themselves out of a home during periods of drought and succumb to severe winters. It was especially hard to watch, she says, during the winter of 2022-’23. “We found families of horses dead within feet of each other,” Chapman says. “It was just really sad.”
Wild horse enthusiasts, however, contend that equines are being unfairly scapegoated when it comes to impacts on the land. Casper College instructor Chad Hanson, who’s an avid horse photographer and writer, says that their impacts on grasslands are “red herrings” — arguments intended to distract from more significant concerns. “The BLM’s rangeland assessments make it clear: Livestock represent the most significant threat to the health and vitality of our public lands,” says Hanson, who joined the checkerboard horse lawsuit as a plaintiff. 
But there is a distinction between how horse and livestock impacts on rangeland are handled, according to Jim Magagna, a longtime lobbyist for the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “It’s the only major species of animals out there that isn’t managed,” he says of Red Desert horses. “We manage our livestock — we harvest our calves and lambs every fall. We manage our wildlife through hunting seasons.” Because wild horses, legally, are neither livestock nor wildlife, the BLM’s toolkit for managing them is much more constrained.

Attempting to remedy the court’s concerns after the 2016 loss, federal authorities prepared an environmental impact statement and updated their resource management plans for the Rock Springs and Rawlins areas. “We’ve been trying to come up with a solution,” says Brad Purdy, a senior advisor for the BLM’s Wyoming office. The federal agency’s analysis assessed different scenarios, in part demonstrating “adequate forage, water, cover and space” to support horses if the trimmed-down herds were confined to solid-block public land outside the checkerboard. Still, there were concerns the herds would easily drift back onto private land. 
Ideas for solutions included fencing the checkerboard and keeping horses on public ground, but that would require extensive fencing that would bisect big game migration routes and could even harm sage grouse prone to striking them. Deemed “not technically feasible,” the gargantuan task was dismissed.
The assessment also considered and dismissed a land swap to consolidate private and public property. “For a land exchange, you’ve got to have a willing partner, and I don’t think we had a willing partner,” says Purdy, the BLM-Wyoming senior advisor. “I’m not saying that in a negative way. It’s completely up to private landowners whether they want to engage in a land exchange with the Bureau of Land Management.” 
The option the agency ultimately landed on was to get rid of the Great Divide Basin and Salt Wells Creek herds, which dwell in areas that are respectively 48% and 72% checkerboarded. The northwestern portion of the Adobe Town Herd, an area that’s 42% checkerboarded, would also be lopped off and managed for zero horses. In total, the contested plans called for ridding roughly 2.1 million acres — an area about the size of Yellowstone National Park — of more than 3,000 free-roaming horses. “When you weighed it all out, this was the most informed and the best decision, I think, the BLM could have made,” Purdy says.

Initially, the courts were on board, upholding the agency’s plans. Rankin’s August 2024 opinion — the ruling that bummed out Smith and the other roundup observers — recognized the BLM’s bind of having to remove the private land horses and having no practical means of keeping others on checkerboarded public land. Represented by Eubanks, horse advocacy groups and individuals again appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
By spring 2025, BLM was already setting in motion its renewed plans, but history repeated itself, and again the 10th Circuit put a stop to the roundups. Like nearly a decade prior, the court faulted BLM for not demonstrating how removing all horses from public land in the checkerboard is necessary to achieve a “thriving natural ecological balance,” referring to the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. “They said it’s the guiding principle of the act, as Congress wrote it, and you can’t just ignore that,” Eubanks says. 
Federal officials turned heads by announcing they were proceeding with the elimination roundups despite the appeals court ruling, sparking another lawsuit, then another — and eventually an assurance that nothing would happen before summer 2026.
So several thousand Red Desert horses remain on the landscape, and land managers, stockgrowers and horse advocates are at a stalemate. “This whole controversy, it’s been a standoff for 15 years,” Chapman says. “I’ve been here since day one, right in the middle of it.” The 10th Circuit’s summer 2025 opinion instructed BLM to go back to federal district court to resolve concerns about “ecological balance,” but BLM’s earlier plans stated there was no ecological justification for removing the Red Desert herds. There was no scarcity of forage, water, cover and space, according to its own analysis. 
Pro-horse plaintiffs say the stakes are high. Herds around the West could be at risk if BLM prevails in removing whole herds because of the checkerboard’s private land, Eubanks says. Every herd management area in the country contains private inholdings or non-federal land. “Where do you draw the line?” the attorney says. “There’s not really any coherent reason why it could not apply elsewhere. Does BLM see this [argument] as specific to these herds, or is this really something that they’re testing out? We don’t know.” 
Meanwhile, ranchers’ patience has been exhausted after decades of legal disputes and the BLM failing to achieve targeted numbers. Magagna, at the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, sees few prospects for coexisting with free-roaming horses in the long term. “At this point, the only way that the landowners could be satisfied outside of a total removal would be if they were reduced down to [agreed-upon] numbers, with a firm guarantee that the horses would be held at those numbers,” he says.

Others say the potential solution was prematurely dismissed by the BLM. “I think the right solution is for the federal government to have land swaps with the checkerboard landowners and consolidate the private lands and the public lands,” says Erik Molvar, a biologist who directs the Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group that focuses on negative impacts of livestock grazing. “Once you consolidate the private lands, then under the Wild Horse and Burro Act, the wild horses that stray can be removed back onto the public lands — and the private landowners can have wild-horse-free private lands.” 
As long as a decade ago, Eubanks was encouraging BLM to consider a land swap as a mutually palatable solution so that the Rock Springs Grazing Association would be unencumbered by horses, which would then dwell only on solid-block public lands. “​​Not one time has BLM even explored the idea — they just refuse to even consider whether it’s a viable option,” Eubanks says. “What’s especially peculiar is BLM does land exchanges of substantial size. They’re the agency that specializes in these federal/non-federal land swaps for precisely this type of purpose.” 
For now, the steady stream of litigation is keeping the Red Desert horse dispute in flux. As this story was going to press, the federal agency and Rock Springs Grazing Association have not shown their hands, declining interviews about legal next steps to satisfy the court’s concerns about “ecological balance.” 
“They could interpret the 10th Circuit opinion differently than I do,” says Eubanks. “We have very little intel on how they’re going to approach these issues. It may be that the outcome of their evaluation sparks more litigation. I’m sure that would be a surprise to no one.”

The Public Service Commission gave notice that it will challenge the ruling of a federal judge who sided with PacifiCorp in a closely watched legal battle.
The post State regulators appeal utility’s victory in Wyoming rate hike case appeared first on WyoFile .","The state panel that oversees public utilities in Wyoming has filed notice that it will appeal the ruling of a federal judge who sided last month with the Equality State’s largest energy supplier in a closely watched rate hike case.
Lawyers representing the Wyoming Public Service Commission gave notice earlier this month that they would ask the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to weigh in on the matter. A group known as Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers, which challenged the rate hike request proposed by PacifiCorp, also filed notice that it would appeal. 
The new court documents merely inform the court that the commission and advocacy group intend to appeal. The actual legal arguments will come later, and the case will likely stretch into next year.
PacifiCorp, which operates in Wyoming under its subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power, filed the lawsuit last year after the commission reduced what had initially been a 29.2% rate hike, which was the subject of contentious public meetings due to the historic size of the proposed increase.

The 2023 rate case ultimately resulted in a 5.5% general rate hike in January 2024, along with a pair of temporary upward fuel cost adjustments.
The lawsuit alleged that state regulators wrongly reduced the rate hike by ignoring federal requirements, costing the utility $23 million. Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers, meanwhile, asserted the rate hike would have forced Equality State customers to subsidize out-of-state users.
Some state leaders have also suspected that PacifiCorp has attempted to shift too much of the costs of a regional power system to customers in Wyoming.
The lawsuit never made it to trial. Instead, U.S. District Judge Kelly H. Rankin granted the utility’s request to decide the case in its favor without a trial, arguing the facts in the case were not at issue.
The lawsuit named Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers as a defendant, as well as commissioners Christopher Petrie and Michael Robinson and then-commissioner Mary Throne. Throne has since left the panel and has been replaced by Chris Boswell, who is also now listed as a defendant in the suit.

With the 250th anniversary of independence from the British monarchy approaching, Americans should reflect on Benjamin Franklin’s cautionary description of our government, writes Rod Miller.
The post ‘A republic, if you can keep it.’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Summer was hot in Philadelphia in 1787, and delegates to the Constitutional Convention were cloistered in the Pennsylvania State House since May. “Cloistered” is the right word, since the doors and windows were closed to give the convention privacy as they worked. Designing a new country is hot, sweaty work, and it must have smelled like a locker room behind those doors.

Opinion

This was the delegates’ second attempt at forming our new government. For their first try a few years prior, they designed a confederacy under the Articles of Confederation, and that didn’t work worth a damn. By September 1787, they had drafted our Constitution — a governing document new to the history of man — and stepped out into the Philly sunshine for a breath of fresh air.
As Benjamin Franklin stretched his legs and looked around for the nearest place to grab a beer, a socialite, Elizabeth Willing Powel, stopped him to ask, Doctor, what sort of government have you given us?
Franklin replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.”
Let’s break Franklin’s answer down. By “a republic,” he meant that the convention produced less of a thing than a process. Not a static consolidation of power as in a monarchy, but a dynamic experiment that puts power in the hands of the citizens. We live in this experiment today.
By “if you can keep it,” Franklin warned that the notion of self-government would be merely an elusive, fleeting ideal if the citizens didn’t shoulder their own burden to keep it alive. Absent that willingness of the citizens to actively participate in their own government, there are forces aplenty watching and waiting for their chance to take over. A republic is a very demanding form of government. Republics die from inattention.
As we approach the 250th anniversary of our independence from the British monarchy, we should take stock of how well we American citizens have heeded Franklin’s cautionary “if you can keep it.” And I’ll submit that the steps we need to take to keep our republic haven’t changed in 250 years.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
The first necessary step is to avoid mythologizing our republic. It is neither a myth nor an ideal; it is hard work. Treat it as such.
Then vote! Year in, year out, 40% of us don’t even take that elementary step. That fact makes our republic a fraction of what it can be. It is hypocritical of us to deport people who want to vote, when nearly half of us don’t take our responsibility to vote seriously.
To keep our republic, we must be both a tolerant and an intolerant nation. We must tolerate different ways of looking at things, because that is the essence of democracy. Tolerance of dissent is difficult, but our Founders, in their wisdom, didn’t want to make things too easy for us.
We must be equally intolerant of anyone or anything that wants to return us to some sort of authoritarian, monarchical rule, just because things often get messy in our republic. And by “authoritarian” I mean both political and religious authoritarianism. Just as we don’t need a king, we don’t need our republic changed into a church, synagogue or mosque. The rule of law, not of kings nor clerics, as Franklin et al intended it, works just fine for a governing principle.
We’ll have a helluva time keeping our republic if we don’t keep our eye on the prize and do the most important work first. So we need to avoid getting distracted by halftime shows, the books that our neighbors are reading, what others do in their own bedrooms and similar distractions that compete for our attention. Remember, republics die from inattention. Pay attention to our republic if you want to keep it.
Selfish citizens cannot keep a republic. To covet universal rights, and to deny, for any reason, the same rights to others that you enjoy, will kill a republic. It kills not only the republic, but the reason behind it. If we want to keep our republic, be generous with the rights it bestows.
Finally, and I think Franklin would particularly agree with this step — keeping a republic demands a healthy sense of humor and irony. People in the act of trying to govern themselves are often funny and plagued with pratfalls and false steps. A republic, viewed in that sense, is like a comedy sketch, and if you can’t laugh at yourself from time to time, you are taking yourself too seriously.
We keep our republic through individual acts of citizenship that add up to reveal our national character. If we, all of us, take Franklin’s admonition seriously, we’ll prove ourselves worthy of a form of self-government that 250 years ago made despots tremble with fear.

I’m here […]","A list of people in Kentucky who have died because of domestic violence, ranging in age from 19 to 73, was displayed in the Capitol rotunda last year during Domestic Violence Awareness Month. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)More than 20,000 times in 2024, survivors of domestic violence bravely reached out to their local Kentucky domestic violence hotlines seeking safety, support, and a chance to build a better future for themselves and their children. 
And more than 20,000 times, Kentucky’s survivor advocates picked up the phone to say, “Are you safe? I’m here for you. You matter.” Our advocates were able to offer compassion and support on the other end of the line because of generations of advocates who painstakingly built ZeroV’s coalition of domestic violence programs over the last 40-plus years.   
Now, because of the ongoing federal government shutdown and other destabilizing actions at the federal level, domestic violence service providers in Kentucky and across the nation are facing enormous uncertainty about their ability to continue providing lifesaving services to survivors. 
What remains certain is that survivors and their children depend on our services for safety and survival, and they will continue to need support regardless of what the future brings for us as providers. Friends, family, neighbors and communities have always had an essential role to play in supporting survivors, but that role may become even more critical should providers be forced to reduce their services.   
This Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we are calling on all Kentuckians to step into the ways they can help create a safer world for survivors and their children. Here are a few steps you can take to help us make sure survivors can always find someone to meet their bravery with compassion and support.  
Learn about domestic violence 
Before you can address a problem, you have to be able to identify it. Learning what domestic violence is will help you recognize when it is happening so that you can take appropriate action to address it. Domestic violence is not exclusive to physical violence;it can also include verbal abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, weaponization of social stigma, stalking and intimidation, sexual and reproductive coercion, and sabotage of career and education. 
Domestic violence is a pattern of violent, coercive behavior used to exert power and control over an intimate partner or family member. It is complex and takes many forms that can be easy to miss and dismiss if you don’t know what to look for. You can start learning more about what DV looks like at zerov.org/resources.   
Build your skill set for support
Supporting survivors doesn’t mean you have to be an expert on domestic violence, it just means offering survivors safety to share their story. Offering safety looks like listening to survivors without judgment, validating their feelings and respecting their boundaries. Your role isn’t to tell them what to do but to walk alongside them and help them navigate their options.
 Learn more about how you can support survivors from the National Domestic Violence Hotline and practice these skills in your everyday interactions to prepare yourself for conversations that help survivors stay safe. To take your skills to the next level, attend a Green Dot class, which teaches tactics and strategies for intervening in situations of power-based personal violence, including sexual violence, intimate partner violence, child abuse, elder abuse, bullying and stalking.  
Engage with your local domestic violence program 
The ZeroV coalition includes 15  state-designated domestic violence programs. Find your local domestic violence program and see how you can support its work, which could look like organizing a donation drive for needed supplies, volunteering for a fundraising event, filling an open position on the board, or making calls to your Congress members and legislators to advocate for continued funding for domestic violence programs.     
We all have the responsibility and the power to support survivors and end domestic violence.

Debate was intense as Democrats said the resolution should have focused on condemning political violence, rather than honoring Kirk’s legacy. 
Senate approves without political violence condemnation
The first iteration of the resolution, offered by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken), focused on Kirk’s life, saying Kirk “dedicated his life with unwavering conviction to advancing the timeless principles of faith, liberty, and truth” through his organization Turning Point USA and that his “powerful voice, seen in his writings, broadcasts and countless speeches, challenged complacency, awakened courage, and emboldened millions to take up the cause of freedom with renewed strength and clarity.” 
“Beyond his public mission, Charlie Kirk was first and foremost a devoted husband and loving father, fiercely committed to his wife and their two young children, whom he treasured as the heart of his life,” the resolution stated. “The brutal and senseless act that claimed his life has shaken our hearts, leaving an immense void not only in his family but across our nation, which looked to him as a steadfast champion for liberty… the Wisconsin Legislature honors Charlie Kirk’s extraordinary life and legacy with deepest gratitude, recognizing his fearless devotion to God, his unshakable love of family, and his tireless service to country.” 
Democratic Senators objected to the lack of a condemnation of political violence as well as the positive light the resolution cast on Kirk’s legacy. They introduced an amendment  that would have focused the resolution on condemning the assassination and political violence wholesale. 
“Your resolution doesn’t mention political violence at all. It is just about what a great guy Charlie Kirk was,” Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said. “That’s not what’s going to bring 33 senators here today together… What could have brought 33 senators here together is the universal condemnation of the assassination.” 
“The Wisconsin Legislature strongly condemns the assassination of Charlie Kirk and extends their deepest condolences to his family and loved ones,” the Democratic proposed resolution stated. “Democracy in the United States depends on the peaceful and civil debate of ideas—not intimidation, violence, or assassination.”
Republican senators rejected the proposal, saying it wasn’t relevant to the resolution at hand. 
The rejection kickstarted heated debate about Kirk’s legacy. 
“I find myself reflecting on the stark contrast between my celebration and the heartbreaking truth that today would have been Charlie Kirk’s 32nd birthday. Charlie Kirk should have had many more birthdays,” Jacque said. “Through Turning Point USA, he challenged a generation, not to surrender to cynicism or drift into apathy, but to stand firm in their beliefs… He was a voice of clarity in a time of confusion, and that voice so full of passion and purpose was silenced in unspeakable act of violence.” 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) started her remarks by quoting Kirk nine times. 
“Quote one,” Johnson said. ‘The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white.’ Quote two: ‘If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service, who’s a moronic black woman, I wonder, is she there because of her excellence or is she there because of affirmative action?’’ Quote three: ‘I have a very, very radical view on this, we made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s.’” 
“Tell me, which one of you is willing to stand up and publicly admit that you or your constituents support this foolishness?” Johnson asked. She then called Kirk’s comments racist. 
Johnson said that Kirk’s legacy was emboldening people with his “hatred” and turning “them loose to be open to accepting their own racism and affirming their bigotry.” 
“My heart goes out to his wife and to his babies. My heart aches for them, but the empathy that I have for his family, Charlie never spared or even thought about extending that type of empathy to people who look like me,” Johnson said. “Choosing to whitewash his legacy and death does not erase who he was or what he stood for.” 
Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) agreed. 
“I will support any resolution condemning his assassination, political violence, because it is the right thing to do, but I will not honor any legacy that undermines the advancement and equality of all Americans,” Drake said.
Republican lawmakers, including Jacque and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), said that Democratic lawmakers were taking the quotes out of context.
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) said he thought the resolution should have focused on condemning political violence and expressed concerns about the way that Kirk’s death was being used by some to go after perceived political opponents. He started reading from an article about the Elkhorn associate principal who was targeted after conservative influencers falsely claimed she had made posts on social media about Kirk’s death. 
Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) ruled Larson out of order and shut off his microphone. 
The Senate ultimately voted 18-15 along party lines to advance the resolution.
Assembly amends resolution 
The Assembly voted 54-42 to concur in the resolution after it was amended to condemn political violence and included some of the language that Democrats had in their proposal. 
The resolution did not go as far as Assembly Democrats suggested. A proposal from them also aimed to condemn the assassinations of both Kirk and former Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives Melissa Hortman. 
Assembly Assistant Minority Leader Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee) noted that Black History Month resolutions written by the Black Legislative Caucus have often faced difficult paths in the Republican-led Legislature. He specifically mentioned the year when the inclusion of civil rights activist and former quarterback Colin Kaepernick on a resolution kept it from coming to the floor.
Haywood said Kaepernick was “demonized for taking a silent knee to protest police brutality.” 
“I have watched several times as Black History Month resolutions and other resolutions recognizing people of color from Wisconsin and their history have been put under a magnifying glass and faced the most intense scrutiny,” Haywood said. “These resolutions over the last seven years have either been left off the calendar or threatened to not be included on the calendar because of the smallest quote, post or like your members find uncomfortable… What is the bar? Is there a different bar for people of color from Wisconsin and their lives and legacies to be recognized and honored by this body?” 
Haywood read off some of the quotes that Kirk made over the course of his life, echoing Johnson.
“These are quotes from Charlie Kirk, who was not a Wisconsinite, nor [did he] have any meaningful ties to our great state or any contributions to our state, and yeah, you are using his name and his death to score political points from Fox News and your far-right donors,” Haywood said. “Your resolution doesn’t even mention condemning political violence. This is all performative theater.”
Haywood said that Republicans were dividing people.
Rep. William Penterman (R-Hustisford) clarified that his amendment did include language about the increasing threats of violence that public figures are facing. He then noted that Kirk would have turned 32 on Tuesday.  
“Most of us in this body are over 32. I myself am not yet,” Penterman said. “As a human being, he had two young kids. He was married. Just having experienced the birth of my second child between last session and this and witnessing that miracle, my heart goes out to his wife, to his kids, and his family. He was a person. He was a husband. He cared about his community. He cared about Turning Point USA… His impact has been felt here in this state and will continue to be.”

Remember watching representatives and senators in their suits, crawling behind those rows of gallery seats? We were stunned by the violence and havoc we were witnessing. 
Jim Brownlow
Jim Brownlow remembers and on Jan. 6 of this year, at 7:15 in the morning, he wrote with red, white and blue chalk on the sidewalk in front of the Muskego Post Office, “Remember January 6th every November.” When you vote, he is saying, remember the violent mayhem you witnessed with your own eyes. 
Two weeks later, two police officers came to Brownlow’s door because the property manager of the post office building complained that someone had “vandalized” the sidewalk and he had to hire a cleaning service to clean it up. When the officers asked Brownlow if he had chalked the sidewalk, he answered only that he had “exercised his constitutionally protected free speech.” He also suggested that chalk can be washed off with soapy water and a broom. The officers left. 
Two weeks later a different officer called to ask Brownlow to come to the police station to answer  more questions in order to complete a report. Brownlow said no, he was busy. The officer said OK, he’d call the next week. On Feb. 4 a new officer called and Brownlow replied he’d already said all he had to say to the first officer.
Within an hour three police officers in two squad cars showed up at his house. Brownlow and his wife invited them in because it was cold outside and normal people in Wisconsin are hospitable. One of the officers said Brownlow was charged with “Criminal Damage to Property Under $1,000” so he was now under arrest and had to go to the station to be processed. (Miranda was not mentioned.) Brownlow said he wouldn’t go without an attorney although, also, he wouldn’t resist because he’s 76 years old and he didn’t want to break anything.
The officers emptied his pockets, patted him down, double handcuffed him, escorted him out his front door to the waiting squad. They drove him to the police station where he was handcuffed to a bench and questioned. His mug shot was taken and he was fingerprinted. They then handed him a summons to appear in municipal court on March 12. 
On March 12 Brownlow said he would not plead guilty and pay a $900 fine (!) so he was given a trial date in August. He tried to enter a plea to dismiss but was told one can’t do that until the trial date.
Six months later, before Brownlow could submit his motion to dismiss, the Muskego prosecutor told the judge the criminal damage charge was dropped because it couldn’t be proven in court. Then, immediately and before Brownlow could figure out what was happening, they turned around and charged him with disorderly conduct. Same moment, same courtroom, same incident, same judge and prosecutor. At that point he was given a new court date of Nov. 7..
And here we are.
Who is Jim Brownlow? He’s us. A quiet guy retired from his career as a middle school librarian. Married to his wife who was a sixth grade teacher when they met. Together they raised their family and were active in their community. Brownlow ran and lost as the Democratic candidate for the Wisconsin Assembly four times from 2010-2016. (Wisconsin’s gerrymandering made it impossible for  Democrats to win in their area.) Brownlow is the kind of person who doesn’t dazzle but whenever you turn around he’s there, caring, helping, championing the privileges and responsibilities of citizenship. 
An assault on our constitutional rights
What are the issues here? The petty harassment of one guy in a small town or an assault on our  constitutional right to free speech? 
Brownlow says it’s the second. 
This is our First Amendment, adopted in 1791. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. 
So when we are told the First Amendment is under assault, here it is. Brownlow has done research (I told you he was a librarian). This is what he has learned: 
The Muskego Municipal Code charge of disorderly conduct, adopted from Wisconsin Statute 947.01(1) says it’s unlawful to “engage in violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, unreasonably loud conduct or in any other disorderly conduct under circumstances in which the conduct tends to cause or provoke a disturbance.”
Wisconsin courts have repeatedly emphasized that:

 The statute must be applied narrowly to conduct that actually tends to cause or provoke a disturbance. Brownlow replies: Sidewalk chalking is inherently nonviolent, non-abusive and non-threatening. It does not fall into any of the categories listed in the statute.
 Disorderly conduct cannot be stretched to cover innocuous or constitutionally protected activity. Brownlow replies: Drawing with washable chalk is a common childhood and expressive activity that does not reasonably cause alarm, fear or disruption.
 The statute requires conduct that is, in context, of a nature to cause real disturbance or disruption. Brownlow replies: Chalking on a sidewalk, where it does not obstruct or endanger others, is expressive conduct entitled to constitutional protection.
 Peaceful expressive activity is not disorderly conduct. Brownlow replies: Extending ‘disorderly conduct’ to cover chalk risks renders the statute unconstitutionally overbroad, as it would criminalize ordinary, harmless activities.

Brownlow’s conclusion: Because chalking is nonviolent, harmless, and not of a nature to provoke disturbance, it cannot constitute disorderly and the citation must therefore be dismissed.
Brownlow is a thoughtful person. “The people carrying out these charges against me are ordinary Americans who do not see this as what it truly is – an assault on America’s constitutional freedom of expression. There was no damage here. I wrote on my sidewalk at home using the same chalk and it washed off in a minute with a hose and broom.” 
“We need to be vigilant and say what’s on our mind peacefully but with determination.”

Hordes of menacing people, many with weapons, stormed our Capitol and yet are now living free lives. Jim Brownlow chalked a thoughtful reminder on a public sidewalk and is, eight months later, still facing a threatening charge. There are wildly and dangerously different standards for freedom of speech here. 
On Nov. 7 Jim Brownlow goes to court. I will let you know what happens. 
In the meantime,  if you have chalk and a sidewalk, maybe it’s time to exercise YOUR constitutional right to free speech.

Bill Lee said Tuesday the crime-fighting “surge” of state and federal officers in Memphis will be a long-term effort.

Bill Lee said the Memphis Safe Task Force is “going to last months” or could last forever.(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday the crime-fighting “surge” of state and federal officers in Memphis will be a long-term effort.
At a Memphis press conference, Lee said the operation’s success will be measured by the reduction of violent crime but gave no specific targets.
“We do know this is going to last for months, and we have just begun. In fact, I will tell you that it will last forever,” Lee said.
At the direction of President Donald Trump and Lee, the U.S. Marshals Service is leading a force made up of local authorities and some 700 officers from the Tennessee Highway Patrol, multiple federal agencies and the Tennessee National Guard. 
Lee said the number of officers “will diminish at some point” but that efforts between local, state and federal authorities will continue in some form in perpetuity.
“It’ll just change in its scope as we execute through the mission,” Lee said.
The Department of Justice released figures to Action News 5 in Memphis this week showing 803 total arrests from Sept. 29 through Oct. 12. More than half of those arrests were for outstanding warrants or deemed administrative, which has meant immigration violations in the past. An outstanding warrant could be for a range of legal violations, such as a missed probation appointment. 
The Department of Justice is releasing overall figures on the operation but not individual reports to allow the public to determine its effectiveness.
At the news conference Tuesday, Lee reported conflicting data compared to the DOJ, saying the task force has arrested 850 violent criminals and “known” gang members. 
Lee has said repeatedly the mission will continue until Memphis streets are safe.

Memphis Democratic state Rep. Gabby Salinas said Tuesday the governor’s comments display a lack of planning and transparency.
“They didn’t have a plan going in. They don’t have an exit strategy, and … every operation should have a clear, concise plan and goals that need to be achieved,” Salinas said.
Even as Lee touted progress, Salinas said two Memphis Police officers were arrested for drag racing and a murder took place recently, despite the buildup of state and federal authorities.
“This has not been a transparent process from the beginning,” Salinas said, “and we are seeing a lot of innocent people get caught up in the system.”
Authorities are stopping people for minor offenses and then figuring out which ones to charge, she said, displaying “disorganization within the leadership.”
Reducing poverty and improving education are proven methods for cutting crime, Salinas said, but she pointed out the governor eliminated a critical summer food program that helped Memphis families.
Memphis Mayor Paul Young expressed support for the crime-fighting effort, saying the community has been looking for solutions to crime for years.
“Our team on the city side is committed to that mission,” he said, adding police are “aligning” with federal and state authorities to cut into organized crime and gang activity.

(Photo by Westend61/Getty Images)The Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association plans to seek a rehearing after a U.S. Court of Appeals panel upheld a ruling barring families from filing “legacy claims” on behalf of deceased relatives who suffered from farm-lending discrimination.
Percy Squire, the attorney representing the association and other plaintiffs in the case, told Tennessee Lookout they intend to seek a rehearing from the panel and a rehearing from the entire United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, “because … this is a case of that importance.”
Squire’s clients, he said, are “seeking to be able to file claims on behalf of the estates of deceased family members who, due to past discrimination, were unable to continue their farming enterprise.”
The Black Farmers association and several individual plaintiffs filed an initial lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in August 2023, alleging that the department acted arbitrarily when it refused to accept those “legacy claims” for relief under the $2.2 billion Discrimination Financial Assistance Program. 
The lower court dismissed the lawsuit due to lack of standing, stating that the law requires the USDA to accept applications only from living farmers. The Sixth Circuit panel of judges agreed.
Appeals court says only living farmers can be ‘assisted’ 
The lawsuit’s challenge of the USDA “puts the cart before the horse,” Judge Chad A. Readler wrote in the Sixth Circuit panel’s majority opinion.
Congress, Readler stated, instructed the USDA in the Inflation Reduction Act to provide financial assistance to farmers who experienced discrimination. The panel opined that “assistance” means a form of help for ongoing tasks or needs.
“It goes without saying that a deceased farmer is not engaged in an activity that money can help complete, nor does the farmer suffer any need that money can help relieve,” the opinion states.
What the plaintiffs are searching for, the panel opined, is “compensation” to “make amends” for the past harms faced by deceased farmers.
While individuals can’t file a claim on behalf of a deceased relative, individuals who hold a debt “that resulted from alleged past discrimination” can apply to the program, the opinion states.
Judge Helene N. White, one of the three judges on the panel, disagreed in part with the majority opinion’s definition of “assistance.”
Congress’ statute measured recovery “by the ‘consequences’ flowing from past discrimination, a distinctly compensatory framing,” White wrote in her opinion. But she agreed that the statute’s use of “assistance” is limited to those “capable of being assisted; i.e., that the applicant is alive to receive the payment.”
Squire said the panel’s interpretation of “assistance” is too limited, and the statute’s history must be considered.
“The whole purpose of putting it in (the Inflation Reduction Act) from the outset was Congress’ desire to deal with past discrimination,” Squire said.
Congress first appropriated funding for “socially disadvantaged farmers” in the act in 2021, referring to a farmer’s race. The statute was repealed in 2022 due to its racial definition and replaced with the current law, which bases eligibility for assistance on past discrimination.
“But now the courts have gone the additional step to say, ‘and it must be individuals who are going to farm in the future,’” Squire said. “Well, that wasn’t the way the original statute was conceived …. They’ve come up now with an additional restriction which once again perpetuates past discrimination, and that’s the problem with it.”

It was Uma Chatterjee, a doctoral student, having a severe obsessive-compulsive disorder flare-up triggered by the pressure of disappearing research funding.

This article was produced by the nonprofit journalism publication Capital & Main. It is co-published here with permission.

Since January, core funding from the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health has faced deep cuts. The administration of President Donald Trump has cut more than $4 billion from the National Institutes of Health and $970 million from the National Science Foundation, affecting more than 7,000 grants, according to Grant Witness, a database tracked by scientists. Although a federal judge ordered the NIH to reinstate some funding, Scott Delaney, a co-founder of Grant Witness, said that “most grants that have been terminated are still terminated. They haven’t come back, and they likely won’t.”
Among the programs being targeted are those designed to expand access to science for underrepresented groups — including people with disabilities, who account for one in four adults in the U.S.
In 2021, President Joe Biden’s administration issued an executive order that prioritized their inclusion in the federal workforce. But the Trump administration has mounted a broad attack on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility initiatives, leaving some early career scientists with disabilities increasingly uncertain about their place in a field where they have long faced systemic barriers.
Chatterjee studies the biology and treatment of OCD, a neuropsychiatric disorder that affected an estimated 1.2% of U.S. adults last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Her lab was awarded a five-year NIH grant expected to provide annual funding, but a few months ago the amount was reduced without explanation, according to Chatterjee. Now the lab is struggling to pay its staff, she said.
Disability researcher harmed
Chatterjee is not the only early career disabled scholar affected. Soli Guzman, a Mount Holyoke College graduate with multiple chronic and neurological conditions, had plans to continue research in protein biochemistry through a program that places underrepresented recent graduates in labs across the country — but those plans were upended by funding cuts.
In April, the NIH ended funding for the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program, forcing colleges nationwide to halt applications. About 50 campus-based programs were affected when DEI initiatives came under political attack, according to John Shacka, an associate professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who chairs a group of PREP program directors. After two lawsuits — one brought by Massachusetts and a coalition of states, the other by public health groups and others — challenged the cuts, a federal judge ordered the grants restored. But last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the lower court lacked jurisdiction, although it left in place the finding that NIH’s process was unlawful. Meanwhile, roughly half of PREP programs remain without support, according to Shacka.
When PREP was first suspended, Guzman had just finished submitting 27 applications to local programs across the country. “The ground was ripped out from under me,” they said. “I’m a planner. I always have a backup. But suddenly, Plan A and Plan B were both gone. I was devastated.”
In April, Guzman received an offer from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Because of funding delays, the university could not place them with a principal investigator until early August. At that point, the lab required them to commit within 10 days.
They turned it down.
They also faced financial and logistical hurdles: the challenge of finding affordable housing, the difficulty of quickly finding a roommate, and the need to pay out of pocket for repairs to a car that lacked proper heating. As a person with disabilities, moving would also have meant establishing a new network of care providers. “My health is at its best since 2020, and I didn’t want to change how good my health is,” they said. “If I got sick, I was stuck.”
NSF grantmaking has also stalled. Tara Lepore, a postdoctoral researcher at Western Michigan University and a grant reviewer, said NSF had paused most review activity for months. While the agency’s grantmaking process has recently resumed, many grants that were already awarded were revoked, something they had never seen before.
Lepore, who lives with multiple disabilities, studies equity in STEM education, or science, technology, engineering and math education. The NSF proposal that they submitted would have funded undergraduate and doctoral students to build collaborations between STEM instructors and neurodiverse students. In June, they heard that while the NSF grant was deemed “highly competitive,” it would not be funded because it did not align with the  administration’s priorities.
“It has all the words that the administration doesn’t like in it,” Lepore said.
In February, NPR reported that the NSF had begun using a keyword filter, flagging terms such as “diverse” and “underrepresented” to screen applications, aligning with new restrictions on DEI content.
Lepore’s project centers on “STEM,” “education” and “equity.”
Capital & Main contacted the NSF and the NIH to ask whether the cuts will affect initiatives designed to expand disabled people’s access to the workforce, education and other areas of public life.
Cassandra Eichner, a spokesperson for the NSF, pointed Capital & Main to a statement made by Sethuraman Panchanathan, the NSF’s director, in April, in which he said that the agency’s investments “should not preference some groups at the expense of others, or directly/indirectly exclude individuals or groups.”
An email from the NIH press team said: “NIH and [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] are taking actions to prioritize research” that directly affects “the health of all Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in [our] mission to Make America Healthy Again.”
The New York Times reported in February that the NSF had indefinitely postponed an engineering workshop aimed at workforce inclusion for people with autism and other neurocognitive differences in the workforce.
Funding cuts worsen longstanding systematic bias
Guzman’s path to becoming a scientist has been marked by significant health challenges. In college, they developed long COVID-19 and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS, leaving them mostly bedridden. They were later diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder. Despite holding student leadership roles and completing three research projects, their chronic health issues affected their grade point average, which stood at 3.4.
“Disabled people are the only minority group anyone can join at any point in their life — but we’re treated like a problem,” they said. “I’ve even been told not to mention my disability in job applications because, in this political climate, it’s too risky. ”
Chatterjee, who studies biomedical science, shared that view. While she was in college, her health nearly derailed her studies. She graduated with a 1.83 grade point average and had to pursue a master’s degree before applying to doctoral programs. She said lab work remains one of the least accessible academic environments for disabled scientists.
“Our work is dependent on rigid protocols, timing and animal models. There’s almost no room for flexibility,” Chatterjee said. “In theory, there should be systems to help — accommodations, people to back you up — but in practice, the culture is incredibly toxic. People brag about working 80, 100 hours a week, skipping holidays, never taking time off. I fought tooth and nail to get here.”
And it’s not just about inclusion or justice. Chatterjee said she believes the Trump administration’s assault on accessibility represents a loss of potential.
Guzman, who is working in a lab focused on disability-related research, echoed this view. They pointed to the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s Department of Regenerative Medicine & Cell Biology in Charleston, South Carolina, which studies Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and said that many in the lab live with the condition themselves. To Guzman, this is a clear example of how lived experience can drive empathy and innovation. “We’re often more flexible and empathetic because of our own experiences,” they said. “That makes a difference not just in what gets studied, but in how labs are run and how students are supported.”
Yet scientists who bring their perspective remain scarce. According to the National Science Foundation, only about 10% of STEM Ph.D. recipients reported having a disability.
“A lot of diversity fellowships end up going to people who are marginalized but still fit the mold of being ‘high-performing,’” Chaterjee said. “Disabled researchers who need real accommodations are often left out, because the system still measures worth by productivity instead of equity.”

(Google Maps)Littleton voters in November will decide whether the city’s land-use code should be frozen as it was at the beginning of the year, essentially locking single-family zoning into place and preventing higher density neighborhoods.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Ballot Question 3A would amend the city charter by preserving single-family zoning as it existed on Jan. 1 and require voter approval for any city-initiated rezoning in residential districts.
The charter amendment was put on the ballot through a petition by a citizen-led group called Rooted in Littleton. Earlier this year, the group helped lead the effort to pressure the Littleton City Council to table an ordinance that allowed denser housing options, such as duplexes, in many parts of the city.
“The only way we could think to stop (land use changes), at least for a couple of years, was to get an amendment on the charter so they can’t change it,” Joe Whitney, part of Rooted in Littleton, said on the Kim Monson Show earlier this month.

Supporters of 3A argue that freezing the zoning code would help preserve the town’s “unique character, yards, trees, and open spaces,” according to the Yes on 3A website.
“It comes down to individual home rights,” Whitney said on Monson’s show. “In our particular case, all of us moved to Littleton because we wanted to get away from the crime, traffic and pressures of downtown to have a more idyllic setting to raise kids and to live. This threatens to make Littleton an extension of downtown, to really densify and double or maybe triple the population of Littleton.”
Littleton is a home rule city of about 45,000 residents in the southwest part of metro Denver.










All of us moved to Littleton because we wanted to get away from the crime, traffic and pressures of downtown to have a more idyllic setting to raise kids and to live.


– Joe Whitney, of Rooted in Littleton, on the Kim Monson Show


3A would not prevent homeowners from applying for different zoning on their own.
The proposed charter amendment comes in the wake of various land use reforms at the state level meant to allow denser development and spur construction of more attainable housing amid the state’s housing shortage. Those reforms include laws allowing more housing near public transit corridors, reducing parking minimums for new developments and allowing accessory dwelling units to be built in single-family zoning in the state’s biggest cities, including Littleton.
Cities that do not comply with those state laws around growth are at risk of losing out on state funding and grants. Littleton City Attorney Reid Betzing said during a recent City Council meeting that 3A could create a potential conflict with Littleton’s ADU ordinance, which was updated earlier this year to comply with state law.
City Council opposition
Opponents of 3A, led by the group Vibrant Littleton, say it would restrict future housing options and limit who can move to the city.
“Most voters understand that 3A is a reaction to proposed housing policy. But here’s the hidden danger: 3A affects far more than housing. It could lock in outdated restrictions on everything from energy efficiency upgrades, in-home care uses, or even changes in the kinds of pets we’re allowed to have,” a post on Vibrant Littleton’s website says. “It is a direct attack on smart, local, flexible governance, and a bad idea for Littleton homeowners of all stripes.”
The Littleton City Council voted 5-1 on Oct. 7 to oppose the ballot measure.
“Land use does not belong in the charter. Look at the charter — land use and zoning aren’t in it,” Mayor Kyle Schlachter said during the meeting. “Second, it’s ambiguous … and ambiguous legislative language leads to lawsuits.”
“When the state says that we have to allow ADUs, but our charter and code conflict with that, that’s a problem,” he said.
The city asked an Arapahoe County judge to review the ballot measure last month but dropped the judicial review Monday.
Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Any eligible voter who registers to vote by Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)When I think about troops coming to New Orleans, I get anxious about the potential impacts on our young people because I know what it’s like to be a kid who is seen as “trouble” in the eyes of authority.

I grew up in the 7th Ward of New Orleans, and I was repeatedly pushed out of school instead of supported — treated as a threat instead of a child with potential. So I know firsthand what could happen if the National Guard is deployed into Louisiana communities under the guise of public safety. There is a deeply misguided narrative about young Black men that criminalizes them instead of recognizing what they need.

Our young people don’t need soldiers. They need systems of care. Louisiana should be investing in mental health care, housing, education, and jobs — not more criminalization and over-policing. Yet year after year, the state pours resources into law enforcement and prisons, as if locking up or intimidating kids will somehow solve the challenges our communities face.












it’s frustrating to see our state double down time and time again on the same failed strategies that criminalize kids instead of caring for them.




I work with youth every day. Through my program Black Man Rising, a mentorship and healing space for young Black men, we talk about trauma, emotions, and accountability — topics many of us were never taught to handle. I see brilliance, creativity, and resilience when these young men are given the tools to lead and the space to be themselves. I see that what they need is systems and people who give them love, consistency, and opportunity — not troops patrolling their blocks.

When I was in school, I was suspended for things like “willful disobedience.” I was patted down every morning and surrounded by guards instead of counselors. Nobody asked why I was acting out. Nobody saw that I was living with trauma from Hurricane Katrina, poverty, and growing up without a father. I was on the path to becoming another statistic — until I found a community that truly valued me: Families and Friends of Louisiana’s Incarcerated Children.

FFLIC was able to fill the gaps in the system, by teaching me that my voice mattered. I began to see that the system was designed to fail kids like me. Most importantly, I learned that I could be a leader in my community and give back to other kids. It was a community that believed in me and my dream for Black Man Rising.

That’s what is missing from our public conversation today. Instead of asking why young people are hurting and how we can show up as a village to help them fulfill their potential, Louisiana keeps turning to punishment. That’s why it’s frustrating to see our state double down time and time again on the same failed strategies that criminalize kids instead of caring for them.

Flooding neighborhoods with armed troops will not stop violence. It will only create more fear and mistrust. It tells Black and brown youth that they are enemies of the state, not valued members of a community.

That is not safety — that is control.

We’ve seen this play out before: in cities like Minneapolis and Los Angeles, when troops were deployed during periods of unrest, young people—especially Black and brown youth—were the first to be stopped, searched, or swept up in curfew arrests.

Real safety is about care and making sure every child has access to high-quality schools, safe housing, health care, mental health supports, and job opportunities. And it means ensuring that when a young person shows signs of distress, there’s a counselor or mentor— not a police officer—ready to help.

If Louisiana truly wants safer communities, it’s time to hold policymakers accountable to the same standards they use to judge our youth. We can’t keep blaming children for the failures of systems that were never designed to help them thrive.

I believe in a Louisiana where every young person is seen, heard, and valued — a Louisiana that uplifts healing instead of harm. We can build that future through targeted investments into our communities. But we can’t do it by meeting our children with soldiers instead of support.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguardthree_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s all-Republican congressional delegation continues its messaging effort about the ongoing shutdown of the federal government, which the GOP controls but needs Democratic votes to fund. 
Neither side sees an end in sight, because people in both parties feel they are winning the messaging battle by trading blame. 
Congress failed to fund the federal government this month. The Senate has been deadlocked, as neither the House-passed Republican stopgap spending bill nor a competing Democratic proposal has garnered the 60 votes needed to advance.
Nebraska’s congressional delegation is shown in Washington. From left: U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., and U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. Feb. 5, 2025. (Courtesy of Nebraska Governor’s Office)
The main point of contention: Democrats seek to extend the enhanced tax credits set to expire by year’s end for individuals who obtain health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Republican congressional leadership has expressed no interest in negotiating on the health care subsidies during the shutdown. This shutdown, the roles are reversed, as Republicans when they were in the minority sought policy changes to approve temporary funding or end a shutdown. 
The federal government has been shut down since early October. House Speaker Mike Johnson has designated this week as another in-district work period, making it the fourth week the House has been in recess.
The Trump administration began its promised mass layoffs of federal workers Friday. The White House is gearing up for a long shutdown and has found several new funding streams for critical programs, including paying troops using tariff revenues, according to Punchbowl News. 
“The whole thing’s frustrating,” Nebraska GOP U.S. Rep. Mike Flood told the Examiner about the shutdown.
Flood said “nobody should be surprised” by the president’s layoffs. The president telegraphed them, and Flood thought they might happen sooner. 
“When Congress fails to do its job by simply funding the government, the government doesn’t have the money to run. It has to reduce the force of our federal workforce,” Flood said.

When asked about the layoffs, Flood hinted at concerns over the White House eliminating the Community Development Financial Institutions fund, saying he would make a case to the Trump administration to keep staff in place. 
The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, part of the Treasury Department, is tasked with supporting community financial institutions that provide financial services to low-income communities and areas often overlooked by larger traditional banks, such as rural areas. 
“I’m certainly going to share with my contacts at the White House how important it is to make sure that staff stays in place, because we definitely need the help right now as it relates to affordable housing,” Flood told the Examiner. 
The White House is set to abolish the fund by Dec. 13.  The Treasury Department, where the fund is housed, is just one of the federal agencies facing layoffs during the shutdown. The Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency are some of the others being affected. A federal employees union has filed a lawsuit over the shutdown layoffs. 
This wouldn’t be the first time Flood has pushed back federal layoffs. He played a part in reversing a cut that would have halted the deployment of weather balloons in Omaha and other Great Plains offices.
California Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat, has expressed similar concerns over the firing of Community Development Financial Institutions Fund staff, calling it “unprecedented and unconstitutional.” 
“Donald Trump and his Budget Director Russell Vought are using the government shutdown … as a cover to advance the radical Project 2025 agenda and undermine hard-working American families and the programs they rely on,” Waters said. 
Like many fellow congressional Republicans, Flood has been on local and national media trying to make the case that Democrats caused the shutdown. At a press conference Sunday, Flood said they had not come to the table to do the “right thing” and described being forced to deal with a shutdown as being “held hostage.”
Nebraska GOP U.S. Sens. Pete Ricketts and Deb Fischer have called the shutdown a “Schumer shutdown” after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer told Punchbowl News that he feels that Democrats are gaining political momentum during the shutdown. 
Shutdown messaging from Democrats has varied. Some, like Pennsylvania U.S.  Sen. John Fetterman said Democrats are sending “the wrong message.” Others, including New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont progressive independent Sen. Bernie Sanders argue that they are “standing up” for people and their health care.  
Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said Trump and congressional Republicans “own” the government shutdown. 
Flood and retiring Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., have alluded to being open to extending the COVID-era health insurance subsidies with some tweaks, and say the shutdown might be about more than that. 
“If you really listen to the Democrats, it’s not about the ACA tax credits … it’s anger at the president,” Bacon said. “They’re trying to show their base that they’re fighting back … and that’s what this is about.”

I was at the first Boise No Kings rally in June and will be at the next on Saturday … which would surprise some people given my long Republican past.
Thousands participate in ‘No Kings Day’ protest at Idaho State Capitol in Boise

I spent decades being active and working in GOP politics, at the local, state, and federal levels, including working for a Republican U.S. senator and President George W. Bush. 
And I want nothing to do with the presidency of Donald Trump.
Some critics of No Kings question the value of peaceful protests. Gandhi, Martin Luther King, et. al. disagree. Critics also get hung up on the “No Kings” name and argue we don’t have a monarch, so what’s the point?
We don’t have a king, but we do have a hot mess in this country thanks to a chaotic and impulsive president and his administration. 
We have an unlawful and economically damaging tariff regime that both changes on a whim and has sent us into a jobs recession while stoking more inflation.
We have publicly ordered, flimsy prosecutions of political enemies, even as veteran U.S. prosecutors and Justice Department officials are being fired and resigning rather than follow unlawful and unethical orders.
We have equally unlawful firings of federal employees during a government shutdown, happening because a Republican president and GOP majorities in both houses of Congress can’t govern. Ironic firings since many similar layoffs during the failed DOGE experiment (remember that?) were reversed in court because – and I believe we have a pattern here – they were unlawful.
But not just unlawful, incompetent too. The Trump administration’s war on public health continued last Friday with mass layoffs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But mirroring the failures of DOGE, hundreds of those firings were rescinded within hours. Maybe someone figured out laying off people with important jobs working on epidemics and infectious diseases is a bad idea?
Proving the point of the incompetence, one CDC employee currently working on measles outbreaks (caused by the anti-vaccine thinking now touted by the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) was one of the recent, quickly rescinded layoffs, even after she experienced the same, “now-you’re fired, now-you’re not” whipsaw under DOGE while working on Ebola earlier this year. 
All of which gets to part of what is driving protests like No Kings: These are not just protests about policy disputes, they are protests about the very nature of how our government is being run.
And there is no clearer example of that right now than the conduct of ICE and other federal agents, lawlessly detaining and abusing U.S. citizens and others legally in our country because of how they look, not because of probable cause that such persons have committed a crime. 
I remember from my decades in Republican politics that the right used to object to the idea of masked, unidentified agents of the federal government roaming the streets of America in unmarked vehicles going after people they think don’t look like real Americans.
That’s as good a reason to protest as any if you believe in the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. 
Some on the right will claim No Kings is just “antifa” or that such protests are riots. That’s laughably false. I’ve spent enough time in politics in the Northwest, especially around Seattle, to know what is called “antifa” is a tiny, motley collection of anarchists and far left activists who think Bernie Sanders is a bit too conservative. 
I’ve also been to enough protests and have friends around the country who have done likewise to know the No Kings protests are legal, permitted events in public spaces to exercise the right of free speech. There were millions of Americans at those protests in June. There will be millions more at hundreds of protests around the country on Saturday.
Some may disagree with the anti-Trump motive for these protests, but that is their purpose, and as U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, encouraged to: “Be peaceful, patriotic, and joyful.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-15 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Coast moved toward resilience since Katrina, but insurance is a lingering ‘disaster’",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/15/mississippi-coast-resilience-but-insurance-a-lingering-disaster/,People on the Coast fear rising insurance premiums are already pushing lower- and middle-income families away from what used to be blue-collar communities.,"KILN – In the days leading up to the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Hancock County emergency director Brian “Hooty” Adam recalled an eerie moment, one he fully recognizes sounds made up. 
Trudging through a pile of debris in the woods, Adam stumbled upon an opened book. Staring up at him, he said, were pages from the Book of Genesis telling the story of Noah’s Ark, in which God forewarns of a catastrophic flood. 
“If I hadn’t witnessed it, people would probably have never believed it,” said Adam, who took over as director two years before Katrina flooded his county with a nearly 30-foot storm surge. 
In 2005, he rode out the storm of biblical proportions in the county’s old emergency office, a defunct bowling alley near the shore in Bay St. Louis. Adam, sporting a full mustache and a red polo, now works in a state-of-the-art, bunkered operations center in Kiln, about 10 miles north.

Proudly walking through the new stronghold, he explained the progress Hancock County and the rest of the Mississippi Gulf Coast made over the last 20 years, such as adopting modern building codes, updating their emergency plans and elevating construction in flood prone areas. 
But while the Coast is spearheading resilience in Mississippi, it also exemplifies an economic dilemma creeping into all corners of the region and country as a whole.
“The biggest remnant of Katrina that is still causing a disaster is the insurance,” said Rhonda Rhodes, president of the Hancock Resource Center.
Coast life’s rising cost
Vandy Mitchell, a retired state employee in Biloxi, said he could throw a dart at the city’s map and find someone with home insurance problems, whether they’re worried about their policy being renewed or their premiums skyrocketing. 
Katrina was a major turning point in the insurance market. Before the storm, Mitchell said the premium for his 1,400-square-foot home was about $900 a year. Now, he said, he pays $4,200 a year, a 360% increase over 20 years. That’s more than he pays for the mortgage on his house, Mitchell added.
“That’s not the way it’s supposed to work,” he said. “It’s getting harder and harder to justify living in this area.”

Home insurance is the primary way homeowners can secure their shelters and belongings in case of a natural disaster. Those with little or no insurance have to rely on donations or hope the disaster is large enough to secure a federal declaration, something that is difficult in small, rural areas such as those throughout Mississippi. 
Even if a declaration does come, the Federal Emergency Management Agency as of 2023 capped housing assistance payments at $42,500 – far below most homes’ value. Moreover, as The Associated Press reported, the government is taking longer than before to issue declarations, extending the limbo for uninsured storm victims.
In Mississippi, nearly a quarter of homeowners pay less than $100 a year in home insurance, which, as experts told NBC News last year, means they have such scant coverage they’re essentially uninsured. Only two states, West Virginia and New Mexico, had a higher percentage. 

Within Mississippi, though, several counties have much higher rates. In Jefferson County, where more than 1 in 4 lives below the poverty line, 48% of homeowners lack meaningful insurance. 
Across the country in places with increasing disaster risk, insurance companies are both hiking premiums and pulling out altogether. David Krenning, an insurance agent in Ocean Springs, said large carriers such as Allstate and Progressive have stopped writing wind and hail policies on the Coast in Mississippi. 
Coast residents often are left with policies from either the “wind pool” – a state-funded program – or an “unadmitted carrier.” The Mississippi Insurance Department allows unadmitted, or unregulated, carriers to work in the state to bridge the gap left by larger companies. But those options come with higher costs for the homeowner and less regulation by the state. 
Living on the Coast, Krenning said, is becoming tougher for blue-collar families who have been there for years. He said it’s common to see houses for $250,000 – just over the area’s median value – to have $5,000-$6,000 annual premiums just for wind and hail policies. 
“It’s tough for folks who lived here their entire life, they paid off their home,” said Krenning, who grew up around his family’s insurance business. “For a long time, people were coming here because the cost of living was so cheap. But the continually rising insurance costs could really hinder some areas of the Coast.”

Rhodes, of the Hancock Resource Center, said rising premiums are preventing homeowners from making improvements to better storm-proof their houses. The effect, she said, is translating to renters, too.
“We have apartment complexes that were built after Katrina, and they’re having issues because they have capital improvement needs.” Rhodes said. “But they can’t keep the housing affordable and make those improvements with the cost of insurance looming over their head.
“The frustrating thing is, it’s been 20 years (since Katrina), and we’re still paying for insurance like it was last year.”
Couches on blocks
After hurricanes Zeta and Ida – in 2020 and 2021, respectively – Jackson County received about $18 million in federal disaster grants, and is now developing what officials there say is the state’s first resilience plan. Part of the plan includes improving drainage in the low-lying, flood-prone city of Moss Point. 
Moss Point Mayor Billy Knight said flooding has become so common in the city that during a heavy rain, residents elevate couches and beds inside their homes onto blocks to keep them dry. 
“It’s just become a normal thing,” he said. 
Like other parts of the Coast, Moss Point sits in a swampy, wet ecosystem, and early developers didn’t always consider drainage when planning new housing, Knight said. Now, increasing rainfall is overwhelming the city’s aging stormwater system. 
Most of East Moss Point sits in a “high-risk” flood zone, which means mortgage lenders require homeowners there to have flood insurance. Residents in the city pay on average about $1,300 a year in flood insurance premiums and fees, federal data show. 
But East Moss Point, where the median household income is $26,000, is also the poorest part of the city. Many of the city’s low-income families settled there, Knight explained, because that’s where the cheapest property is.
“People have to go to where they can afford,” Knight said. “Sometimes they don’t realize why the houses are not as much as on the other side of town. They’re cheaper because you’re in a flood zone.”

‘Long overdue’ solutions
Insurance experts agree that as climate volatility continues to trend upward, the cost of protecting disaster-prone homes will only grow. 
“It’s really strange to say, but the insurance industry was one of the first industries talking about the impact of climate change,” said Chip Merlin, an attorney who specializes in insurance claims and who worked with Katrina survivors in Mississippi. “If you go back 20, 30 years ago, it was some of the largest multinational insurance companies saying, this is going to be a problem, and it seems to be getting worse.” 
Those on the Coast, such as Krenning and Rhodes, fear rising premiums are already pushing lower- and middle-income families away from what used to be blue-collar communities. 
In Alabama and Louisiana, lawmakers fund incentives encouraging homeowners to mitigate their roofs using “FORTIFIED” standards, a program through the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety. The grants provide up to $10,000 per house. 
A study this year by the University of Alabama found, during Hurricane Sally in 2020, FORTIFIED homeowners in the state filed fewer than half as many claims as everyone else. Upgrading the roofs for every home, the research said, would have slashed total damage costs by about two-thirds.

Policy and planning experts point to mitigation grants and statewide, uniform building codes as key avenues towards climate resilience at the local level. Mississippi lacks both. 
“The only way we’re going to lower (insurance) rates on the Gulf Coast is through mitigation, building a stronger home,” said Mississippi Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney.
Mitchell, the Biloxi resident, said he would love to upgrade his roof, especially if it means chopping down his insurance bill. But doing so costs thousands of dollars – close to $20,000 for a 2,000 square-foot home, according to Habitat for Humanity. It’s so expensive that he joked it’d almost be easier if a storm came and blew his roof off for him. 
“I think we’re long overdue for that in Mississippi,” Krenning said of a state-funded mitigation grant.

Rhodes, whose nonprofit has worked to improve housing in Hancock County since Katrina, said outside of insurance issues, the Hancock County community has “bounced back beautifully.” Waveland was decimated by the hurricane and is finally starting to see new development arrive, she said, although businesses there now have to navigate costs to elevate their buildings. 
“They’re going to get there, it’s just a little slower,” Rhodes said. “The people who live here, the ones who were here during Katrina, it’s enough of a memory in their mind now that we can appreciate all the good that’s come from it. I do think the people’s spirit and attitude is resilient.”
Getting ready to retire after 22 years as the Hancock County emergency director, Adam recognized not everyone wants to relive the horrifying events of Hurricane Katrina that took 238 lives in Mississippi. But for him, he said, it’s a duty to impart whatever knowledge will help others learn, calling those lessons a “blessing in tragedy.”
“Here’s the thing: People are not going to want change,” Adam said, describing stricter regulations on the Coast. “They didn’t want change when (Katrina) happened. But it’s inevitable. As long as I’ve been in this, if I don’t change and I don’t learn, I shouldn’t be in this job.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20062909/Hancock-Emergency-Mgt-7.jpg,,,2025-10-15 06:58:36.743089

Walker Memorial Plaza in Richmond Tuesday. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)When Virginia’s two attorney general candidates are set to meet Thursday at the University of Richmond for what is expected to be their only debate before Election Day, the focus will almost certainly fall on one thing — the scandal over Democrat Jay Jones’s recently leaked text messages to Republican Del. Carrie Coyner that sent shockwaves through Virginia’s 2025 election cycle.
Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk, has apologized for sending messages that referenced shooting former House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah — comments that have upended the race and now threaten to define it.
‘Beyond disqualifying’: Jay Jones controversy jolts Virginia’s pivotal 2025 elections

In the August 2022 exchange, Jones told Coyner that if given a choice between Adolf Hitler, Cambodian dictator Pol Pot and Gilbert, “then Gilbert gets two bullets.” He later elaborated in a phone call that “it would take Gilbert’s wife holding their dying children in her arms” for him to act on gun safety legislation.
When the texts surfaced earlier this month, Jones did not deny writing them, but refused to follow widespread calls to drop out of the race.
The controversy has rippled beyond the attorney general contest, dominating all three statewide races. Republicans have seized on the episode to boost Attorney General Jason Miyares and GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears. The Republican Governors Association poured an additional $1.5 million into attack ads aimed at Jones.
Cook Political Report analyst Matthew Klein said the violent rhetoric is “uniquely potent” in a year already marked by political violence — from the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump and the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, to recent attacks on Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota.
In Virginia, multiple politicians, including Del. Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun, and Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, have reported receiving death threats. Former Democratic House candidate Susanna Gibson also said she was targeted in 2023, with a SWAT team called to her home.
In the Jones scandal, Coyner further alleged that the Democrat had suggested in 2020 that police officers would need to die before they would stop killing others, but he denied the claim.
Klein said the recent events underscore how partisan polarization has hardened voter attitudes. 
“It’s possible,” he said, that some Democratic voters could support their party up and down the ticket in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4 election while still leaving Jones’ box on the ballot blank. Others, he added, may “hold their nose” and vote for him anyway. 
“I absolutely think this is a very competitive race right now,” Klein said. “Miyares has a decent chance to win another term, which was not something that I would have said even a couple of weeks ago.”
With early voting underway and calls for Jones to withdraw coming from both parties — including Trump and some national Republicans — Thursday’s debate is expected to be a critical moment.
The controversy has become a test of political loyalty, forcing Democrats to decide whether to stand by a wounded nominee or risk conceding the race altogether.
 Local and national significance

Political analyst Bob Holsworth noted that gubernatorial candidates often capture most of voters’ attention during statewide elections, but he, too, emphasized the significance of the contest between Jones and Miyares.
“This is the most important attorney general race since Massive Resistance,” he said, referring to the campaign of opposition led by conservative state lawmakers in the 1950s to block the desegregation of public schools following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education decision. “That’s because of the impact that the attorney general role has with the Trump administration.”
He pointed to Miyares’ influence over hiring and firing legal counsel at public universities. Attorneys general also serve as counsel to governors, and Youngkin has stacked university boards of visitors with his appointees. 
One such institution, the University of Virginia, has been embroiled in controversies this year over complaints about lack of transparency, pressure from the Trump administration to roll back Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, and the resignation of its president following pushback from the White House. 
Immigration is another area where Miyares could remain a Trump ally while Jones stands to be his counterweight in Virginia. 
As detentions and deportations of undocumented immigrants have ramped up since Trump’s second term began earlier this year, Miyares has supported claims that the thousands of people rounded up were violent criminals. 
He and Youngkin could not substantiate that claim this summer, and records as of October show that a majority of those detained so far do not have prior criminal histories.
Miyares offers no proof that 2,500 immigrants arrested by Va. task force were violent offenders

Klein emphasized that Democratic attorneys general remain one of a few checks on power against Republican majorities in Congress and the White House. 
While Virginia is in the process of potentially enshrining abortion protections into its state constitution, other states with bans have sought the extradition of people who travel for the procedure —  an area where attorneys general play a key role. 
Though the attorney general is a state-level position, it can wield national influence both politically and within the country’s legal system. From joining multistate consumer protection lawsuits that transcend state borders to serving as an ally or adversary to presidents, the office’s impact extends well beyond Virginia. 
Where Miyares has routinely supported Trump, Jones has campaigned on serving as a defender against the president. In recent months, Democratic attorneys general have joined forces on measures to prevent Trump from deploying the National Guard in their states and to block proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
While attorneys general are not lawmakers, they can exert influence in the state legislature by endorsing or opposing key bills. Miyares has repeatedly used his office to oppose legislation allowing certain offenders who have demonstrated rehabilitation to shorten their sentences. In 2024, his office threatened to withhold state-appropriated funding from a victims’ assistance organization because it supported a bill that he opposed. 
Although Jones has not yet served as the state’s top lawyer, he has outlined priorities for the laws he would champion if elected. For instance, he plans to join multistate coalitions pushing back against abortion restrictions or bans and supports Virginia’s ongoing constitutional amendment process to enshrine abortion protections. 
Where Miyares could continue to act as an ally to Trump, Jones has presented himself as someone who would sign onto lawsuits challenging what he views as instances of federal overreach by the Trump administration. 
 Up and down the tickets

Though Trump has loomed large over American politics at every level for the past decade, Miyares and Jones appear on the ballot this year beneath their respective running mates: Earle-Sears and Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. 
While it would be rare for Virginia to see a split-ticket result, Klein isn’t ruling out the possibility. 
Beyond the state’s history of electing governors and executive tickets opposite the party that won the White House the prior year, Klein said he still believes Spanberger holds an edge for several reasons. 
While she has focused her campaign on outlining policy proposals, Klein said Earle-Sears’ fixation on issues such as transgender bathroom access and participation on sports teams isn’t widely appealing. Her “downright toxic” stances on same-sex marriage and workplace protections, he added, risk alienating voters and put her at odds with Republican lieutenant governor nomineeJohn Reid — a gay man who admits that the two don’t agree on his identity and who he loves. 
Klein added that the economic fallout from federal actions, including workforce cuts, has also become a pressing issue both candidates have had to address. Virginia, along with Maryland and Texas, has the largest concentration of federal workers in the country. 
“The cake was kind of baked there from the beginning with the DOGE firings,” he said, referring to Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency. 
And downplaying the state’s economic hit, Klein warned, could cost candidates votes.

Spanberger, meanwhile, has had to navigate GOP efforts to tie Jones’ text messages to her campaign. 
Holsworth said it’s a new strategy he’s seeing — one that suggests Republicans may spend the rest of the election cycle “trying to use the bottom of the ticket to influence the top.”
During last week’s gubernatorial debate, Earle-Sears frequently interrupted  Spanberger, lambasting her for sharing a ticket with Jones and repeatedly calling  for him to drop out. 
“Jay Jones advocated the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children,” Earle-Sears told the moderators at one point. “What if he said it about your three children?” she asked  Spanberger directly. “I’m asking my opponent to please ask Jay Jones to get out of the race.”
When moderators pressed Spanberger on when she learned about Jones’ texts and if she endorsed him, the Democrat did not say explicitly whether or not he had her support. 
However, Spanberger called the messages “abhorrent” and suggested  she first learned of them when the story broke,  reiterating that  she had denounced them at the time. 
Signaling her intent to run her own campaign, Spanberger added, “It is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information.”
With the controversy over Jones’s texts still reverberating across the campaign trail, Thursday’s attorney general debate will likely offer voters their clearest look yet at how both men defend their records — and how they define the office in a sharply divided Virginia.

The two candidates spoke to more than 400 attendees from business, education and policy backgrounds about the challenges and their respective plans during Tuesday’s conference at the Greater Richmond Convention Center, which focused on building a more skilled and competitive workforce. The event was co-hosted by the Virginia Chamber Foundation, Virginia Business Higher Education Council, VCF Workforce and Education Center and Virginia Talent + Opportunity Partnership. 
Spanberger, the Democratic nominee, addressed improving Virginia’s rating for the Best State to do Business by CNBC. The commonwealth, consistently ranked a top-three finisher in the past five years, dropped from the top spot to fourth this summer due to the federal job cuts by President Donald Trump’s administration that have disproportionately affected Virginia, home to 147,000 civilian federal employees. The state did maintain its top rating for education for the second straight year. 
“We must do everything we can to get Virginia back to number one in the CNBC rankings and that means strategic investments in workforce training, affordable childcare and housing, streamlining permanent shovel-ready sites and reliable infrastructure,” said Spanberger during her remarks Tuesday morning.
Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor and the GOP challenger for governor, did not mention the ranking, but instead explained how collaboration has played a big role in education and workforce development in the commonwealth, and applauded the Virginia Chamber, which she said “brought together the people who make Virginia’s story possible.”
“(But) this is not a moment for complacency,” Earle-Sears said. “It is a call to strengthen our resolve and sharpen our edge and continue to lead; and under my leadership, Virginia will rise to that challenge. We will maintain not just our domestic competitive advantage, but our international life as well.”
She spoke about how Virginia’s education system shaped her career, urging stakeholders to continue working together to ensure that Virginia has a “phenomenal” workforce across all sectors. She also touted the success of the current administration, led by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, by investing in businesses and teacher training, as well as expanding laboratory schools that offer tuition-free specialized instruction in high-demand careers such as teaching, computer science, and technology.
Earle-Sears said artificial intelligence poses a rising challenge for Virginia as it competes with countries outside of the United States, and supports workforce reentry for groups like veterans and military families. 
As governor, Earle-Sears said she would continue the current administration’s priorities of strengthening the workforce and empowering students through rigorous academics and different pathways.
Spanberger noted the cost of living as a sizable challenge, with Virginians navigating rising expenses for health care, housing, and energy, and facing uncertainty amid the federal government’s job cuts and shutdown.
The state could do more to support working people by establishing family medical leave, increasing affordable housing supply and childcare access and raising the minimum wage, Spanberger suggested.
As for displaced workers, the Democrat proposed ways the state could help identify adjacent job opportunities and expand career mentoring. She also shared plans to strengthen workforce development from early childhood through career training, increasing funding for community colleges, expanding dual enrollment classes and ensuring flexibility in the education system to prepare students for emerging technologies. 
“I know there are those who think you can be pro-business or pro-worker, and I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s some people in this room that hold that opinion, but I reject that idea. We can do both,” Spanberger said. “Virginia’s economic success has always come from balancing those forces, and under the right leadership, with the right coalition, we can keep that balance for decades into the future.”
Both candidates also defended their stances of support for Virginia’s right-to-work law, which prohibits employees from being required to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment.
Keith Martin, interim president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, told reporters that the conference is a way for stakeholders from all industries and the candidates for governor to collaborate, as it follows the Blueprint Virginia 2035, which serves as a guide to ensure the commonwealth remains a top state for business. Historically, the chamber has not endorsed any candidate.
“We’re working with both candidates for governor,” Martin said. “We’re optimistic in our partnership that we’ll have with the next governor, and the collaboration we have with the business community and higher education moving forward.” 
The deadline to register to vote, update registration or apply for a ballot to be mailed is on Oct. 24. In-person early voting ends Nov. 1. Election Day is Nov. 4.

More than a decade ago, residents of Loudoun County, Virginia, banded together to buy up treasured open space before it became a strip mall and housing development, donating the land to the Piedmont Environmental Council instead. The nonprofit has maintained it as a unique blend of cattle pasture, a nature preserve, and a community farm that donates its yield to a local food pantry.


Now, a small corner of the farm has become what organizers say is a first for the state: a crop-based agrivoltaics demonstration project. They hope the combination of solar panels and vegetable farming will showcase how much-needed renewable energy can complement, not harm, agricultural lands, at a time when data centers are demanding more and more electricity.


The Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to stop burning fossil fuels by 2045and to develop 16,100 megawatts of land-based renewable energy by 2035 — mostly in the form of solar.


Virginia has more than enough room to meet that target without threatening great swaths of farmland. Using a conservative metric that 10 acres of land can host 1 megawatt of solar capacity, a Nature Conservancy analysis found that the state has 40 times more suitable land area than needed for solar fields, even after ruling out over 2 million acres of ​“prime conservation lands” including farmland.


Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University determined that large-scale solar today is erected on less than 1% of the state’s cropland. Under a ​“high-growth scenario,” that figure could rise to 3.1% by 2035, including 1.2% of the state’s federally designated prime farmland. Yet low-density residential development may pose a far greater threat to those spaces, according to research by the nonprofit American Farmland Trust, which advocates for ​“smart solar” that doesn’t jeopardize agricultural land.


In fact, many landowners find that renting a portion of their land to solar companies can help their farming enterprise pencil out financially, reducing pressure to sell their property to developers. An acre of land, after all, may yield hundreds of dollars if devoted to crops but thousands if leased for panels.


And yet there’s no doubt that solar has grown exponentially in the state in the last decade, and that it has disproportionately displaced farmland. Cropland makes up 5% of Virginia’s total acreage but 28% of the land area now used for large-scale solar, the Virginia Commonwealth University researchers found.


Especially in the early years of renewable-energy construction, some companies set a poor example for responsible development, said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council. ​“It was a little bit ​‘Wild West,’” he said. ​“Those early projects in 2018, 2019 — there were a lot of significant runoff issues.”


As solar fields have gone up at a breakneck pace — replacing plots of forests as well as farmland — opposition to them has also grown. Virginia localities approved 100% of solar projects in 2016, according to reporting from Inside Climate News. By 2024, the approval rate had fallen to under 50%.


The increasing number of rejections stems from a ​“a mix of disinformation and resentment,” Kapoor said. But the tension between solar and farmland is real. ​“That’s a national thing,” he added. ​“It’s everywhere.”


Agrivoltaics — the awkward portmanteau of agriculture and solar photovoltaics — has emerged as a potential solution, wherein farmland is kept in production even while it hosts solar arrays. The most common application is sheep: They graze on vegetation beneath the panels and prevent the need for expensive and polluting mowers. Planting flowers in and around panels to supply honeybees and other pollinators is also popular.


Still, the Piedmont Environmental Council team wanted to experiment with a crop-based model because it fits better with what most farmers in the area are doing now: raising vegetables.
“You want to change as little as possible for the farmer,” said Teddy Pitsiokos, who manages the organization’s community farm.

Occupying a quarter-acre section of the nonprofit’s 8-acre community vegetable farm in Loudoun County, the agrivoltaics project is small by design. It features 42 ground-mounted solar panels with a total capacity of 17 kilowatts, two batteries for backup power during outages, and about 2,000 square feet of growing area.


The array will supply more than enough power to meet the farm’s needs, with additional headroom for a planned EVcharger and a greenhouse that organizers want to electrify eventually. But the Piedmont Environmental Council isn’t trying to demonstrate scale. Rather, it hopes to carefully measure impact.


With the shade and protection from rainwater that they provide, how do the solar panels affect soil moisture and temperature? What’s the resulting crop yield? What do vegetables grown beneath and near solar panels look like, and how will consumers react? Do any contents from the panels make their way into the crops, posing health problems?


Most research has found that the answer to the last question is no. But the team still plans to test for contaminants in response to public concern as a show of good faith and transparency, and in an effort to address any potential barriers to agrivoltaics from the get-go.


While most crop-based agrivoltaics projects involve growing produce in the ground, the Piedmont Environmental Council’s farm also includes raised beds, which enable educational tours and widen the demonstration project’s relevance.


The beds do increase costs, said Pitsiokos. But the rationale for them, he said, ​“is so we can create data for people who might be doing this in an urban setting, a parking lot, or on some other nonpermeable surface,” he said. ​“We have productive agricultural soil; not everybody does.”


The experiment could also help inform compliance with new state rules designed to mitigate land loss from solar: Certain developers have to conserve land on a one-to-one basis for projects on prime farmland, but their burden is less if the array is used for agrivoltaics.


Pitsiokos also wants the data to reach educators, policymakers, and cohorts he hasn’t anticipated yet. ​“We want to share it with everybody,” he said, ​“because we know that we can’t predict who might benefit from it exactly.”


Perhaps most of all, the Piedmont Environmental Council hopes the project will reach farmers. Plenty are outspoken on solar, both for and against. But a 2024 survey from the American Farmland Trust found that most Virginia farmers and farmland owners hold nuanced views. Over half would consider solar if they could continue farming under and around the panels, according to the survey, but nearly two-thirds agree that solar developers should be responsible for returning land to a farmable state after an array is decommissioned.


With the project’s first crops of kale getting harvested this month, the Piedmont Environmental Council plans to make real-time data available as soon as this winter, for all to see. But grand conclusions won’t be forthcoming for another two or so years.


“Like with all scientific experiments,” Pitsiokos said, ​“slow is actually good.”

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Republican state Del. Ian Lovejoy wants to continue his work in the Virginia House of Delegates representing voters in part of Prince William County, and is facing a challenge from Democrat and former state lawmaker Elizabeth Guzman. Both have different views on how to address data centers, reproductive rights and the increased cost of living, issues which loom large in Northern Virginia’s House District 22.
With all 140 House seats up for grabs, the two candidates are contending for a seat that could help Democrats maintain control of the House for an additional two years or give Republicans control again as a new governor takes office.
The candidates are also campaigning on shared challenges for voters including traffic and commuting burdens, school quality, community safety, and environmental and development pressures due to the demand for data centers and their high energy needs. 


Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Familiar foes, new stakes: Coyner–Dougherty rematch tests Va.’s suburban swing in House District 75
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41


 Data centers and rising energy demands

Both candidates weighed in on data centers, one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, with dozens of the facilities located in their district.
“We’re in a real bind, because this industry has outpaced our regulatory schemes,” said Lovejoy, a small business leader and entrepreneur. “Historically, power infrastructure is socialized and paid for by everybody, but the data centers are the sole cause of this massive increase of power infrastructure need, and so we have to work on legislation that ensures data centers aren’t getting that power infrastructure on the back of your average rate payer.” 
Lovejoy said he intends to reintroduce proposals to address the issue by adding clarity to data center siting rules, ensuring they are not built too close to residential areas, forests and historic assets. He’ll also continue to support legislation that helps prevent taxpayers from paying too much for the power-thirsty data centers.
Guzman — who attacked her opponent on receiving donations from utility companies, as reported by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP) — emphasized the need for community input on decisions about data centers and other public projects, and said the centers should be located in industrial areas, and not next to homes and schools.
“As someone who has refused utility company money, I will always put families before corporate interest,” Guzman said. “I’ll push for stricter regulations, environmental safeguards and public hearings so residents have a real voice before projects move forward. Unlike my opponent, I’ve never taken money from utility companies.”
Lovejoy’s campaign said his opponent is “grasping at straws” when claiming he is compromised and is “hypocritical” considering the donations she’s received from organizations that have lobbied against data center proposals.
Guzman’s campaign has financially outperformed her opponent’s, raising over $946,000 compared to Lovejoy’s roughly $537,000 as of Oct. 5, according to VPAP.
 Reproductive rights 

In the upcoming General Assembly session, lawmakers will vote again on a bill to enshrine abortion protections in the state’s constitution, which successfully passed the legislature earlier this year.
Guzman, a social worker who supports abortion access, is likely to vote yes on the measure that advances other reproductive freedoms, unlike Lovejoy, who supports a 15-week abortion limit with exceptions and voted against the amendment.
“I would happily support that constitutional amendment because abortion rights are human rights, and that no legislator should be involved in a personal medical decision that only belongs to a woman and her doctor,” Guzman said.
Guzman also criticized her opponent for voting against the abortion protection bill.
Lovejoy’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Guzman’s claims about the reproductive rights amendment. Instead, he publicly questioned her silence on texts by Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general nominee, in which he talked about a hypothetical scenario where a former Republican Virginia lawmaker and his children would be killed in 2022. 
“I call on Elizabeth Guzman to join me and denounce this rhetoric and call for Jay Jones to withdraw from his race for Attorney General,” Lovejoy posted on X, as reported by the Prince William Times.
Broadly, Lovejoy’s Republican colleagues have said that the legislation is too extreme, overrides parental rights and fails to protect the unborn.
Guzman’s campaign declined to comment regarding the text messages.
 Cost of living

On lowering the cost of living, Lovejoy supports cutting taxes and reducing government size. Guzman supports targeted tax relief on cars and groceries, while also backing investments in public programs, which may necessitate revenue increases.
“The number one way we can keep money in people’s pockets is how we manage the commonwealth tax scheme,” Lovejoy said, adding that maintaining a strict tax regimen that doesn’t increase the burden on taxpayers can help to make life more affordable for Virginians, including housing.
“There’s a lot of pressure to raise taxes in different parts of our current tax code, and that’s been kept largely at bay because of the governor’s veto pen. So I worry, should we lose that ability, where the tax scheme is going to go.”
Guzman supports increasing the minimum wage and expanding worker protections. Lovejoy has not spoken on wage laws, but has focused on economic growth through deregulation and tax relief during his time in the House.
 Diverse needs

Guzman stated if elected to serve the competitive 22nd House District, she will continue to work across party lines and achieve results for her constituents, who represent a range of ethnicities, occupations and political persuasions. She emphasized that she has a proven track record of serving voters with different views than hers in parts of Fauquier and Prince William counties during her six years in the General Assembly, before her previous District 31 was redrawn by the Virginia Supreme Court.
“I represented Prince William and Fauquier County, which was red and rural, and just being the only Democrat in the room when we were having conversations about decisions of how to make life better for residents, never intimidated me,” Guzman said. “I was there to work with Republicans to deliver for my district.”
In 2023, Lovejoy won by nearly five percentage points in the newly drawn House District 22, the same district that favored Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by nearly two percentage points over elected Republican President Donald Trump last November. He said if reelected to his second term, he and his office will continue to support his Northern Virginia constituents and that civility will remain a central goal of his work as a legislator.
“I’ve been very conscientious of realizing that I represent a very split district, and we are responsive to everyone’s complaints, concerns (and) constituent services, equally,” Lovejoy said. “The tone of our campaign is not to vilify an entire political party or people, and I think that’s important and leading in the future.”
The deadline to register to vote, update registration or apply for a ballot to be mailed is on Oct. 24. In-person early voting ends Nov. 1. Election Day is Nov. 4.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal / Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio is nearly halfway to the next constitutional deadline for congressional redistricting, and so far no public movement to reconvene the Ohio Redistricting Commission has been made.
Ohio House and Ohio Senate majority leadership say they’re awaiting the governor’s word that the commission will be meeting, and Democrats say they aren’t aware of any updates.
At a press conference last week announcing an executive order on intoxicating hemp, Gov. Mike DeWine was asked when the redistricting commission would meet, and simply said “soon.”
“Well, we know what the law is, it’s going to have to occur this month,” DeWine said. “We know that it will occur.”

Because the General Assembly didn’t adopt a congressional district map before the end of September, the state constitution dictates the next deadline is Oct. 31.
That deadline lies with the ORC, who have until then to hold public meetings and come up with a map that has bipartisan support.
The legislature is required to redraw the congressional map, which establishes the boundaries of Ohio’s U.S. House and Senate districts, to be used in the next election and beyond.
The redraw is constitutionally required because lawmakers weren’t able to garner bipartisan support for the last set of maps, adopted by Republicans on the redistricting commission in March 2022.
The Ohio Supreme Court deemed the current map unconstitutional, but a federal court didn’t intervene in the congressional map challenges.
A separate court challenge to the map was dropped by anti-gerrymandering advocates as a ballot initiative to reform redistricting and the next round of map-drawing seemed set to happen before the case could be resolved.
Legislators who led a joint committee on congressional redistricting last month fought back against calls that a map proposal was required before the constitutional deadline in September.
State Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, insisted the September deadline was one of many in the constitution, therefore did not legally bind the legislature to a certain date.
“Sept. 30th is in there, and yet, the constitution provides for a process if we don’t meet that,” Bird said at the first meeting of the joint committee on Sept. 22.
At the second and final meeting of the committee before the first deadline passed, Bird maintained the message that “we’ve still got a couple of months and we’ve still got time to keep talking.”
Legislative Democrats proposed a map in September, with eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts.
Minority party leaders said the proposal was meant as a jumping-off point for discussions about redistricting, in hopes it would spur more urgency in the process.
The current map is made up of 10 Republican districts and three Democratic districts.
While the joint committee heard hours of support for the Democratic proposal, with only one person speaking out against it in the public hearings, no vote was held on the Democratic map.
When asked about the progress on a Republican proposal, Bird said he didn’t know of a map as of Sept. 30.
Staff for the Ohio House GOP and the Ohio Senate GOP both said they didn’t have updates on the redistricting process as yet, nor did House and Senate minority staff members.
House Minority Communications Director David Meyers said “nothing firm” had been communicated when it came to a date for the commission to begin, and Casey Rife, communications director for Senate Democrats, said the caucus was “hoping to get to work as soon as possible.”
If the Ohio Redistricting Commission can’t come to agreement on a map, the process moves back to the legislature with a Nov. 30 deadline.
Different rules apply if the process returns to the General Assembly, and a map would only need a simple majority for passage.

(File photo courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Public health experts in Georgia are speaking out against furloughs at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention they say have left hundreds of employees at the agency unemployed as the federal government shutdown enters its third week.
Federal employees began receiving reduction-in-force notices, the technical name for layoffs, on Friday. Initially, about 1,300 CDC employees received notices, but many of the firings were reversed the next day. According to the National Public Health Coalition, a group of terminated CDC workers and their allies, about 600 layoffs are expected to be permanent.
The cuts initially impacted a wide range of departments, including the CDC’s flagship publication, known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency’s Washington office, the National Center for Health Statistics, and leaders working to contain infectious diseases like measles and Ebola. At least some of the employees in those departments have since been reinstated.
Andrew Nixon, who serves as director of communications at the HHS, said some employees “received incorrect notifications due to a system glitch.” 
HHS employees who received notices, he added, “were designated non-essential by their respective divisions.”
But Abby Tighe, a former CDC employee who serves as executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, questioned the department’s explanation for the firings. 
“These terminations were not a glitch,” she said. “It was not an innocent error made. This round of firings, as with all the others experienced at CDC in the last 10 months, was an intentional attack on the American people and the public’s health.”
Tighe’s organization, formerly known as Fired But Fighting, has repeatedly called for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign.
“We need an HHS Secretary who is ready to work with Congress and is ready to listen to the needs of constituents in the United States and who is ready to actually lead the department, and right now, we do not have that,” she said. “We would love to see Congress step in and really force HHS to have a stronger sense of leadership that is based in science and in public health expertise.”
Dr. John Brooks, a retired infectious disease specialist who once served as Chief Medical Officer for the CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention, also expressed worries that cuts to the agency will leave the U.S. vulnerable to future public health emergencies.
“Many experts, including myself, are concerned that we are no longer well-prepared for the next big outbreak or disaster because of the Trump administration’s continued erosion of our nation’s ability to respond to public health emergencies,” he said.
The American Federation of Government Employees, a union which represents over 820,000 federal employees across the U.S., estimates that 3,000 workers — or nearly a quarter of the CDC’s total workforce — have left the agency since January. Yolanda Jacobs, who serves as president of AFGE Local 2883, also criticized the federal government’s firing of CDC workers.
“These reckless actions are disrupting and destroying the lives of everyday working people who are constantly being used as bargaining chips,” she said. “They deserve the same opportunity any other American deserves: The ability to put food on the table for their families, pay their rent or mortgage and not have to wake up each day wondering if they’ll be fired because they are federal employees.”
Along with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the AFGE filed a lawsuit last month challenging the mass firing of government employees during the shutdown.
“We’re going to speak up,” Jacobs said. “We’re not going to let this whole thing unfold in silence.”

Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, hears a presentation from representatives of the Claremont School District about a $5 million budget deficit the district is facing, on Oct. 14, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)As the Claremont School District reels from a $5 million budget deficit, reducing staff, shutting schools, and fighting to get through the school year, Republicans in Concord are split over how much they should help out. 
On one side are those who say the state should provide some temporary financial assistance to give the school board breathing room as it digs its way out of its fiscal hole. On the other are those who say that would set a bad precedent for future financial crises in other districts. At a key meeting of the Senate Education Committee Tuesday, lawmakers ultimately pushed off a vote on a bailout in order to discuss the matter further.
But whatever they decide for Claremont, Republicans agree on one takeaway from the city’s crisis: The state should impose more oversight over school districts and their budgets. And some say they will propose legislation next year to do so.
Sen. Victoria Sullivan, a Manchester Republican, says she has filed legislation to allow for the possibility of receivership over struggling school districts. In an interview, Sullivan said her bill would allow the State Board of Education to investigate problems in public school districts and assume some management responsibilities over those schools during crises. 
“Kudos to Claremont: The community are stepping in to make sure the kids still have their extracurriculars and doing what they’re doing,” Sullivan said. “But we should never get to this point.”
Some Republicans say the state’s Department of Education should impose more oversight. Rep. Jim Kofalt, a Wilton Republican, said the department should conduct regular audits of school district budgets to catch any irregularities before they balloon. 
Others have raised the possibility of legislation that would enable recall elections against school boards if residents feel they have caused a crisis and want new leadership. 
“Voters who feel that they need new boards don’t have a mechanism to do so,” said Rep. Daniel Popovici-Muller, a Windham Republican. 
Rep. Rick Ladd, a Haverhill Republican and the chairman of the House Education Funding Committee, noted a number of bills submitted ahead of next year’s session that would enhance the Department of Education’s authority, including one of his labeled “relative to the intervention of the department of education into a school or school district during a financial emergency.”
“There has to be some kind of a hammer or accountability oversight that the Department of Education and the state treasurer have here,” he said.
The proposals have emerged as Claremont’s woes have entered the statewide spotlight. In August, the city’s school board reviewed an audit and discovered that mismanagement of the budget meant the district had fallen $5 million behind in payments, with virtually no cash on hand to pay those debts and keep the school operating.
That shortfall caused an immediate catastrophe for the board, which faced questions about whether classes could even resume in September. After around 40 layoffs, the closure of an elementary school, and a $4 million loan from the Claremont Savings Bank that is due in April, the district has managed to continue classes this school year, explained James O’Shaughnessy, the attorney for the school board, on Tuesday. 
The board has hired an interim business administrator, Matt Angel, to oversee a series of aggressive cuts to services to pay off debts while any mismanagement is addressed. That process could take about two years, aided by the district’s regular allotment of state “adequacy funds” every quarter as well as city property tax revenue, O’Shaughnessy said.
But because of its limited cash flow — and the need to pay back the $4 million loan in April — Claremont will likely have no funds from April to September to continue paying for operations without more financial support, O’Shaughnessy said. That means even with a proactive debt relief plan, and even with its regular quarterly adequacy payments, the district would likely not be able to reopen for the 2026-2027 school year if it cannot access more loans, he added.
This month, two Republican lawmakers — Ladd and Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee — have proposed a state-backed solution: a “temporary, targeted” revolving loan fund to help the district access cash quickly.
The two have both proposed an amendment to an existing bill that will be taken up by the House and Senate in early January. 
The proposal would direct the state treasurer to create a non-lapsing fund separate from all other funds. The fund would include no more than 75% of the total amount that the state already sends the district in annual adequacy aid. The district would be required to pay any money it withdrew from that fund back to the state with interest, and each withdrawal would need to be made with an agreement among the school board, the Department of Education, and the state treasurer. 
For Ladd and Ward, the legislation is an unusual but necessary fix. The preamble of the bill states that Claremont “faces immediate and extraordinary fiscal challenges that may impact its ability to provide an adequate education to its students.”
“We’ve got to keep it narrow in scope. We need to help those kids in Claremont,” Ladd said. “…That school has to stay open for the rest of this year. This is one way of doing it.”
But others said the precedent could inspire more mismanagement from other school districts, or allow school boards to evade difficult decisions when facing a funding gap.
“Many of us are concerned,” said Kofalt. “We’re concerned with making sure that the people of Claremont are ultimately able to continue with our schools open, but we are also concerned that this should never happen again in other districts”
And some, like Popovici-Muller, said that lawmakers should come up with a more permanent financial aid approach that is not specific to Claremont. 
“This is not something that we’ll be lingering on, but please consider that (it’s) a complicated mess that’s still unraveling. We’re still trying to understand what happened. We need a more thorough solution.”
Democrats said lawmakers should take more time. Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, argued the state should help the district before it begins diving into bigger solutions.
“There’s a leak in their boat, so we have to plug up the leak, and then we can review why there was a leak in the boat at a later date,” she said. “But we can’t let this boat, the Claremont boat, sink with children in the boat, because we want to look at the structure of how the boat was built or the maintenance of the boat.”
O’Shaughnessy echoed that point.
“This is an extraordinary, extraordinary thing that we’re all doing today to ask you to adopt special legislation,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if there were good alternatives.”
Still, soon after the Senate committee meeting concluded, House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, an Auburn Republican, issued a statement underscoring the political difficulty of a quick decision that could earn the support of the House and Senate. 
“House Republicans will fight to protect the taxpayers from bailing out the incompetence of Claremont schools,” he said. “I appreciate the efforts of Claremont’s state senator and look forward to working on a solution that will solve the issue in the long term, not a short-term fix that throws money at the problem and hopes it goes away.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA144703-Rick-Ladd-1024x712.jpg,,,2025-10-15 05:56:42.614715

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)NEW YORK — On a busy street in Queens, New York, just around the corner from a halal hot chicken sandwich restaurant and a barber shop, the Long Island City Health Center welcomes its patients into a brightly lit waiting room, painted baby blue and filled with soft white and gray seats.
A woman working behind the desk on a recent weekday answered one patient’s questions in Spanish. Other patients came dressed in hijabs, kurtas or other traditional clothing from countries around the globe. A caseworker assigned to the center rolled one woman, wheelchair-bound because of a stroke, toward an examination room.
The Long Island City Health Center is part of a national network of more than 1,300 community health centers, safety-net clinics that served more than 31 million patients in 2023, according to KFF, a health research nonprofit. The clinics are located in areas where there aren’t many doctors or hospitals, and they provide care to all patients, regardless of their ability to pay.
Thanks largely to their broad reach, the centers have long enjoyed bipartisan support. But the federal government shutdown, freezes to federal grants, looming cuts to Medicaid and new Trump administration policies barring some immigrants from receiving care at the centers have put them under financial stress.
Community health centers disproportionately serve low-income people, people of color and rural residents. In 2023, 90% of patients had incomes at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, according to KFF. Forty percent of patients were Hispanic, 17% were Black and 31% were rural residents.
More than 80% of patients were insured, and about half of all patients were covered by Medicaid.
The health centers are funded by the payments they get from Medicaid, Medicare and private insurers, plus federal and state grants. Money is always tight, but between 2010 and 2023, average operating margins remained in the black. That changed last year, as the average margin dipped to -2.1%, according to an audit conducted by the National Association of Community Health Centers.
Half of community health centers have fewer than 90 days of cash on hand, and one-quarter operate with margins below -4%, according to the audit.
1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

When the Trump administration froze some federal grants in February, it forced some clinics, particularly in rural areas, to reduce hours or shut down. The broad domestic policy law President Donald Trump signed July 4 is projected to increase the number of uninsured patients seeking care at the health centers. And the ranks of the uninsured would grow further if Affordable Care Act insurance plans get much more expensive at the end of this year, as would happen if Congress fails to extend tax credits that have kept prices down.
Meanwhile, the government shutdown has prevented Congress from renewing the Community Health Center Fund, which expired on Sept. 30 and provides about 70% of the centers’ federal funding. And the centers worry that a new Trump administration policy barring them from providing care to some immigrants would force them to dedicate scarce resources to verifying patients’ legal status. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the change.
Andrew G. Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told Stateline that the administration is “fully committed to protecting America’s community health centers, which play a vital role in serving millions of families nationwide.”
“The Trump Administration is working to reopen the government and restore full funding, while also ensuring that federal resources are prioritized for American citizens and lawful residents in accordance with the law,” Nixon said in an emailed statement.
This year, some states — including Connecticut, Illinois and Minnesota — approved more money for community health centers. But Illinois and Minnesota also have scaled back or ended health care programs that served low-income people regardless of their immigration status, which might prompt more of those patients to seek care at the centers. And California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state’s Medicaid program.
“Historically, health centers have had bipartisan support, but we’re operating in a very different world now,” Feygele Jacobs, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University, told Stateline.
Jacobs said health centers are a target for the Trump administration because they serve people of color, low-income residents, immigrants and the uninsured.
“It’s those very communities that are really being challenged right now by the administration,” Jacobs said. “So I don’t know that the focus is so much on health centers as entities, but really more on an administration whose views are antithetical to many of the people that health centers have historically cared for.”
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

But Chris Pope, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute, questioned whether the Medicaid changes included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would lead to a significant increase in the number of people without insurance or a dramatic reduction in the program’s finances.
Pope also noted that the law doesn’t take direct aim at the federal funding of community health centers.
“There’s no direct cut in terms of reimbursement for community centers,” Pope said. “It’s not the intent of the bill to slash and attack health center revenues.”
Welcoming culture
The first community health centers were created in 1965 in Mississippi and Massachusetts as federal demonstration projects under President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty. The program became permanent in 1975.
Doctors at the Long Island City Health Center describe it as a one-stop shop for patients. In addition to providing primary care and mental health services, the center has an in-house pharmacy and provides laboratory tests, vaccinations, drug treatment, HIV/AIDS treatment, and support for transgender patients and their families. Including its dozen medical residents, the center has doctors who can speak French, Tamil, Kru, Ibo, Yoruba, Spanish, Hindi, Nepali, Russian and Tagalog, among other languages.
Dr. Libby Brubaker, an attending physician at the Long Island City Health Center, told Stateline that providing a welcoming atmosphere for everybody is at the core of the center’s mission.
“Our social workers go to bat for our patients and help them get access to housing. … We write letters to allow our patients with asthma to be able to have air conditioners inside their apartments,” Brubaker said.
“Really what we’re providing for our patients is all encompassing, and that sets us apart,” she added. “Hospitals don’t do all of those things. They do some, but being able to offer that breadth of services in an outpatient setting is invaluable.”

Sandra Tapía, a Long Island City resident from Bogotá, Colombia, walked into the clinic on a Friday to see her nutritionist for the first time. She’s been in the U.S. for seven years, is a green card holder and has Medicaid. She said she likes the center because “it’s close and it’s safe.”
Tapía said she can’t imagine not being able to have access to health care, and values being able to speak to her provider in her native Spanish.
“Here, they offer really great services,” Tapía said. “I don’t want people without as many resources, like me, to be punished.”
The idea of cuts frightens patients such as Olga Scott, 65, who said she has been coming to Long Island City Health Center for years. Scott lives in the Bronx, but takes an hourlong subway ride to the center so she can see her favorite doctor.
“These community health services around the whole community of these five boroughs are needed — it’s really needed,” she said. “I just hope that they don’t do too much cutbacks, because we need every service we can get.”
Dr. Sindhura Manubolu, director of the family medicine program at the center, said she’s sensing “a lot of anxiety” from her patients, especially those who rely on Medicaid.
“Most of the questions from our patients have been around, ‘Oh, will we lose coverage?’” said Manubolu, who is an immigrant from India. “For someone to be here in an advanced country like America, and then not being able to access the health care that probably is even available to a person in a less developed country is not acceptable.”

Bipartisan support
On Capitol Hill, community health centers are an increasingly rare example of bipartisan agreement.
In May, Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island wrote a joint letter to the chairperson and ranking member of the Senate health appropriations subcommittee, urging them “to provide robust funding” for community health centers, describing them as “a bipartisan solution to keeping Americans healthy and saving taxpayer dollars.”
Wicker and Reed argued in the letter that the centers save the overall health care system billions of dollars by reducing the burden of chronic disease through prevention and early intervention, and lower long-term Medicaid and Medicare spending by curbing expensive emergency department visits, hospital admissions and invasive procedures. The senators also noted that the centers employ more than 310,000 people and generate more than $118 billion in economic activity.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

“Republicans in particular have always argued that one of the reasons for not pushing for more insurance coverage was the fact that we have these centers,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, which advocates for broader health care access.
Benjamin noted that the centers’ importance to rural, mostly Republican communities has heightened their broad-based appeal. He said draining money from them “is not a rational decision.”
“The administration has a nonsensical and uncoordinated health policy overall,” Benjamin said. “These important things that keep people alive and keep them healthy are getting caught in this very bad public policy time we’re having.”
But Robert Hayes, president and CEO of the Community Healthcare Network, the largest network of community health centers in New York City, said the centers there are determined to do what they have always done, regardless of the current challenges.
“We are secure. We’re obeying the law. We’re doing the right thing,” Hayes said. “I don’t mean to dismiss the anxiety that is around health care for the vulnerable these days, but our job is to not let it distract us from what we have to do, which is important and very hard to do: [provide] the most fundamental and primary and preventative health care for people who are basically excluded from the health care system.”

They say they want to hear from citizens first. But Democrats say they are purposely going slow to skirt guidelines.
The clock continues to tick for Ohio to pass a new congressional map. After lawmakers failed the first step in the process, which would have been to pass a bipartisan map by the end of September, the Ohio Redistricting Commission (ORC) takes over.
Now, everyone is waiting on Gov. Mike DeWine to convene the group, which he said on Friday would be “soon.”
“When is soon?” we asked the governor.
“Soon,” he said, smiling.
“I feel like we do the ‘soon’ conversation a lot,” this reporter added, referencing how whenever he doesn’t want to share details with reporters, he says “soon.”
“Well, we know what the law is,” DeWine responded. “It’s going to have to occur this month.”
The ORC’s five Republicans and two Democrats will debate how to draw the state’s 15 U.S. House districts. The group is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats in the Statehouse. The three remaining seats include the governor, secretary of state, and auditor — all of which are currently held by Republican officeholders.
Ohio’s congressional districts are currently composed of 10 Republicans and five Democrats. They were declared unconstitutionally gerrymandered twice, but Ohio voters were nevertheless forced to vote under them in 2022 and 2024.
On average, Republicans win 55% to 45% of the vote over Democrats in Ohio. With that breakdown, Democrats proposed a map with eight seats leaning red and seven leaning blue.
The Republicans still haven’t introduced their map yet — more than a month after the Dems did.
“I don’t think it does any good to just introduce a map so everybody has something to talk about,” House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said after we asked for his response to citizens who are upset that the GOP hasn’t given them a map yet.
Republican legislative leaders say no map has been designed yet, and they have not talked to the White House about the process.
Huffman said that the public needs to weigh in before a map is made. This sentiment was echoed by a dozen other party members.
“We shouldn’t do it the old way, which is, ‘Here’s the map, pass it, see you later,'” he said.
But Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, say that is exactly what the Republicans are doing.
“(The way the process works) really has upended the opportunity, I think, for a bipartisan map, and a process that would get us to the table because they can just run out the clock,” Antonio said.
If the ORC doesn’t pass a bipartisan map by the end of October, lawmakers get a second chance to pass one — and it doesn’t have to be bipartisan. It would only need simple majority approval.
House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati, is concerned. GOP leaders say they want at least 12 or 13 of the 15 districts to lean Republican.
“They’re worried about losing next November because they’ve broken their promises, so they want to try and steal three congressional districts,” Isaacsohn said.
DeWine is asking for patience.
“These things, if they get worked out — if they get worked out — they don’t usually get worked out in a public meeting,” the governor said.
But as of now, the Democrats, and the public, are left in the dark.
Deadlines and process
FAILED: Sept. 30: The lawmakers needed to pass a map with at least 60% in each chamber, with at least 50% support of Democrats.
Oct. 31: To meet this deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve. They must have two public meetings if they intend to pass a map.
If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Nov. 30: This map can also pass with a simple majority, and it must be replaced after six years.

Here, the Contoocook River in Henniker. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s open spaces are part of what makes this state feel like home to me. 
I have lived, worked, and played in the state for more than three decades. As a member of the board of directors of the New Hampshire Association of Conservation Commissions, I recently saw a newly published report, “The Benefits of New Hampshire’s Open Space,” by the Primrose Research Group. This report uses facts and figures to quantify the importance of our natural areas. Our open spaces, including forests, farms, and surface waters, not only serve as places to recreate, renew, and find enjoyment, they also provide important economic benefits to our state.
The N.H. Association of Conservation Commissions, collaborating with its member commissions, is working alongside other state environmental organizations, such as N.H. Audubon, the Forest Society, the Nature Conservancy, N.H. Land Trust Coalition, and others, to assure that the benefits of open spaces are protected and will serve future generations. 
A common goal for these groups is to protect and preserve open space, town forests, and fields through easement and current use programs, allowing for sustainable timber harvests, as well as the preservation of parks for pedestrian recreation. The same is being done for the protection of towns’ aquifers and waterways, so the next generation has the drinking water it will need. 
This work benefits towns by preserving open space for businesses, recreation — including hunting and fishing — and improving environmental quality, which helps to maintain property values.  In addition, the report notes that green infrastructure, including urban parks and forests, can reduce the energy demand of nearby buildings by 10%.
New Hampshire has been experiencing intense floods, droughts, heat waves, and less snow. These factors cause damage to the built infrastructure, the economy, and to human health. Warmer weather results in more ticks, excessive pollens, and an increase in invasive species, which affects human health and the health of the environment.
It is incumbent upon all of us, as individuals and as members of the environmental community, to prepare for these extremes by using sound scientific practices to make adaptations, including crop rotation, installing road and culvert structures, and monitoring, data collection, and mitigation activities, such as restoring natural habitats, sustainable land management, reducing waste, and using alternative energy sources. 
It is imperative we work to preserve and protect our wetlands, shorelands, streams, and aquifers, and protect forests and habitat diversity. Taking action not only protects the natural environment and human health, but also our state’s economy.
The respective missions and programs of the organizations, those which helped to commission the report, have also helped to sustain open spaces, described in the report, which are essential to New Hampshire’s infrastructure and economy. Open space provides opportunities to support industry, provide employment, connect individuals and communities, improve health, provide food, and build resilience against flooding and excessive heat, as well as contribute to the tax base.
All the important benefits of open space described in the report need to be balanced with the ever-growing demand for affordable housing. As the report notes, almost 5,000 acres of forest land in New Hampshire is used for development purposes every year. Adequate housing is critically important for our future economy. How we balance the benefits of open space and the revenue it generates, estimated to total almost $3.9 billion from recreation alone and more than $500 million in economic value from the agricultural industry, with the need for housing, will determine how we continue to build our New Hampshire competitive advantage, attracting talent and keeping it here. To get to the best solutions that both preserve the economic benefits of open space and meet the need for housing, the decision-making process must involve all stakeholders.  
Social science and land use policy researchers have identified a number of strategies for achieving balance between economic development and land preservation, which New Hampshire municipalities might consider putting into practice. Conservation commissions, town zoning and planning boards, private developers, and interested community members are just a few stakeholders who could review the principles, identify best practices, and come to an agreement that can benefit the entire community.
Towns can support resource efficiency, create jobs by investing in renewable energy, boost economic growth, and reduce environmental impact. Communities can promote reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing to reduce waste and conserve resources. Planners can encourage the design and create incentives for conservation developments, which focus homes and buildings on the least sensitive areas of land, preserving the ecologically sensitive ones. 
Those involved must recognize the interconnectedness of economic development, housing, and land preservation. By implementing sustainable practices and policies, they can create a future that is both economically prosperous and environmentally sustainable. 
We can have both — the economic gains associated with development and a sustainable environment — if we work together and think creatively. That is how we do things in New Hampshire.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/openspace-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-10-15 04:57:36.885522

Government agencies have been closed since the start of October, with congressional Republicans lacking the votes to fund operations.
As expiration of tax credits loom, Ohio insurers ask for big increases

Democrats are holding out, in part, for an extension of subsidies for individual health insurance that would keep premiums from doubling for hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at the start of next year.
Federal employees are starting to receive partial paychecks as a result of the shutdown.
In addition, President Donald Trump is deploying troops to cities in Democratic states on false claims that they’re war zones. 
A federal judge he appointed ruled that his claim about Portland “was simply untethered to the facts.“
After taking controversial actions in places like Chicago, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement upset people in Mount Vernon in Knox County.
About 120 protested Sunday in the town square over an ICE raid last week of a beloved Mexican restaurant, the news organization Knox Pages reported.
Further protests are coming on Saturday. 
Dozens of No Kings protests are scheduled across Ohio as part of more than 2,500 that will take place nationally. 
“Building on the momentum of the June 14 day of action, which drew more than five million people across all 50 states, the October 18 mobilization is the next chapter in this growing movement,” organizers said in a written statement.
 “Together, millions will send a clear and unmistakable message: we are a nation of equals, and our country will not be ruled by fear or force.”

The events are being sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
Mia Lewis is assistant director of Common Cause Ohio and a volunteer with Indivisible Central Ohio. She said 23 protests are planned for the area. 
Rallies will take place in communities such as Newark, Reynoldsburg, Marysville, and Grove City earlier Saturday afternoon. 
Then things will culminate with a 4 p.m. rally at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus.
Lewis said she hoped people would attend both.
“I think it’s really important that there are protests in people’s neighborhoods,” she said. 
“It’s not just about the number of people who come out. It’s about the number of people who are passing by and see that their neighbors and their friends and fellow citizens are out taking a stand. I think that’s a really important message.”
In an era when the reach of traditional news organizations is diminishing, Lewis said it’s also vital for people to peacefully take to the streets in an attempt to highlight what’s happening. 
For example, many might not know that a big part of the shutdown battle is over health care subsidies.
“It’s hard because there are these pockets of information that people are in,” Lewis said. 
“But when people realize that their subsidy for their health care is going to go away and it’s going to be really hard to afford health care; when they see cities having masked troops attacking non-violent people… and the shutdown is scary for a lot of people… I think this will bring a lot of people out.”

[…]","Missouri officials falsely accused Denton Loudermill Jr. in a fatal 2024 shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade. Gossip haunted his last days. (Submitted)There is a scene in the 2008 film “Doubt,” set in a 1964 Catholic grade school, where the priest told a story about a woman gossiping about a man she hardly knew — a situation Denton Loudermill Jr. understood when he was falsely accused in the 2024 shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs celebratory parade.
In the movie, the woman dreamed that night of a great hand appearing that pointed down at her. Seized with an overwhelming sense of guilt, she went to confession the next day with the parish priest, Father O’Rourke.
“Is gossiping a sin?” she asked. “Was that the hand of God almighty pointing a finger at me? Should I be asking your absolution, Father? Tell me, have I done something wrong?”
“Yes,” the priest said. “You’ve borne false witness against your neighbor. You played fast and loose with his reputation, and you should be heartily ashamed.”
Gossip haunted Loudermill in his last days with technologically supercharged rumor traveling at light speed, leading to death threats and slander from which he, and his family, could not escape.
People may not remember his name, but his family will never forget how people falsely accused him in a shooting that claimed one life and injured 22, including children.
He’d stood dazed in the chaos.
People screamed. Fight or flight hormones activated. Panicked parents scooped up little ones as best they could and sought safety, not knowing if they were running at or away from danger.
Unlike those who ran, Loudermill froze, said LaRonna Lassiter Saunders, part of the legal team representing Loudermill’s family.
“He saw a woman shot and bleeding out,” she said. “The shooting began near him. He was in shock. Everyone started running, but he asked himself, ‘Where should I run?’ He was waiting for his ride to pick him up.”
Public torment for this intensely private man began here.
Police cuffed him and sat him on a curb where people began photographing him, perhaps assuming police had collared one of the shooters. Police stopped Loudermill, Lassiter Saunders said, because he moved slowly.
Hard to blame the police in this context. This doesn’t seem malicious. Still, Loudermill sat helpless as photos of him traversed the internet like a lit fuse about to detonate and destroy his carefully guarded world. It did.
Someone at an undisclosed website posted the picture and labeled him a “terrorist,” and as an illegal immigrant. Those images and that narrative spread like a virus. Two Missouri officials used the photo in posts urging the president to “close the border.”
U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Willie J. Epps Jr. on Oct. 7 allowed Loudermill’s defamation case against Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins and state Sen. Rick Brattin to proceed.
Emails sent to the offices of Hoskins and Brattin were not answered.
Given the appetite in wide swaths of society to allow masked law enforcement to tackle and shackle foreign-looking people, imagine the impact on Loudermill and his family.
Death threats rose like a flood.
“I’m just a light-skinned Black dude,” Lassiter Saunders recalled Loudermill saying. “Why are they lying on me? I was born and raised in Olathe. I’ve been here all my life.”
This digital mob predictably but painfully took its toll.
His counselor diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder. In conversations with Lassiter Saunders, he wondered if he’d survive. His weight crashed, leaving him unrecognizable.
“This happened often, usually at the beginning of our conversations,” she said. “The first part of my representation, I was like a counselor.”
Loudermill, she said, would see references to the parade shooting on television. He rarely ventured into social media, but his children would see threats and accusations about him.
Once, at work, he told her he saw someone staring at him. He said they punched keys on their phone. It seemed as though they were pulling up his photo and when it appeared, it registered on their faces.
Once the digital mob poured the illegal alien and terrorist narrative into a mold, it quickly hardened into a truth-resistant bulwark of gossip and stupidity.
“This cost him his life,” Lassiter Saunders said. “The process has outlived him.”
His family found him dead on April 11.
There seems no remedy sufficient for what happened to him. To date, she said, the officials who wrongfully posted his photo have not apologized.
In “Doubt,” the gossiping woman did say she was sorry and asked for forgiveness.
“Not so fast,” Father O’Rourke said.
He ordered her to go home, take a pillow from her bed, climb to her roof, and cut it open.
The woman did as the priest asked and returned.
“What was the result?” he asked.
“Feathers,” she said. “Feathers everywhere, father.”
“Now, I want you to go back and gather up every last feather that flew out on the wind,” he said.
“It can’t be done,” she said. “I don’t know where they went. The wind took them all over.”
“And that,” O’Rourke said sharply, “is gossip.”
And for many, the image of this innocent man as some immigrant terrorist still floats on the digital four winds, impervious to truth.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Try as they did to mislead and deceive Ohio voters about the horror of protecting abortion access and other forms of reproductive care in the state constitution, Ohio Republicans — from the governor on down — failed to fool 57% of the electorate in 2023. 
Voters from across the political spectrum saw through the preposterous propaganda meant to dissuade Ohioans from enshrining the right of every individual “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions” in the Ohio Constitution. 
The decisive passage of Ohio’s Issue 1 amendment to preserve the right to make those decisions, including abortion, was essentially people telling politicians to butt out of personal medical choices they had no business meddling in.
Ohio voters pass Issue 1 constitutional amendment to protect abortion and reproductive rights

Despite the deliberately loaded ballot wording, inserted by Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to subvert the referendum, voters channeled their Midwest sensibility of justice. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion, it was up to states to either restore that half-century right or repeal it. 
Ohio voters chose a rational middle ground to restore a woman’s reproductive autonomy on private medical options that included, but were not limited to “contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care and abortion.”  
It was not unreasonable, a voting majority concluded on Nov. 7, 2023, that the state be barred from directly or indirectly burdening, penalizing, prohibiting, interfering with or discriminating against this constitutional right to reproductive freedom — unless it demonstrates “that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individual’s health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.” 
Put a pin in that caveat.
Voters agreed that abortion may be banned after fetal viability, but no procedure could be prohibited “if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”  
Contrary to claims made during the Issue 1 campaign, late-term abortions are extremely rare, representing less than 1% of all abortions in the U.S.  
Despite the fear-mongering and falsehoods thrown at Ohio voters weighing the abortion rights amendment, despite the ton of money dumped to defeat the measure by the Catholic Church, the citizen’s initiative is now Article I, Section 22 of the Ohio Constitution. 
The people spoke. Resoundingly.
Yet, ever since, a clear majority of the statewide constituency secured the constitutionally protected right to make reproductive decisions without government interference, the government has interfered. 
Ohio Republicans signaled their intent from the beginning not to respect the will of voters on self-determination, but to override it.
The day after the amendment passed, more than two dozen GOP lawmakers in the legislature signed a statement to “do everything in [their] power” to maintain restrictive abortion laws on the books in Ohio.
A handful of anti-abortion zealots even tried to seize “exclusive authority over implementing” the constitutional amendment from the judiciary “to prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts.” 
 “This isn’t the end,” huffed then-Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman (and current Ohio House Speaker) who promised “a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace” the reproductive rights amendment. 
Former Speaker Jason Stephens warned “the legislature has multiple paths that we will explore” to undercut the people’s wishes. 
Ohio’s Republican attorney general is still soaking taxpayers with endless litigation to preserve parts of the state’s six-week abortion ban that multiple courts have ruled unconstitutional. 
Meanwhile, Ohio Statehouse Republicans can’t stop coming up with new legislation in 2025 to burden or impede individuals from accessing their constitutional right to abortion. 
Ohio House Bill 347 would reinstate a 24-hour waiting period for abortions (along with state-mandated information and in-person visits) unrequired in other medical procedures.

Never mind that the existing law, blocked by an Ohio judge as unconstitutional, is still in court. 
Two other anti-abortion bills in the Ohio House could potentially limit access to medication abortion (used safely in the U.S. for 20 years) and threaten non-abortion healthcare for low-income Ohioans by banning Medicaid reimbursements to clinics that provide abortions.
But the real topper by Republican lawmakers — less than two years after voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion — is Ohio House Bill 370, sweeping legislation that would impose a near-total ban on the procedure. 
The proposal would redefine legal personhood to begin at conception, effectively granting fertilized eggs full legal protection under Ohio law. 
After their setback in 2023, the Republican supermajority in the legislature has attempted to regulate, restrict or outlaw abortion as if nothing changed. 
Pending bills that would undermine legalized abortion in the state are designed to overturn the popular vote of Ohioans. 
GOP lawmakers in other red states are following similar playbooks with voters who approve progressive measures Republicans oppose. 
The unaccountable autocrats, who erode the power of direct democracy, do not answer to the gerrymandered constituents they take for granted or feel any obligation to adhere to the letter of any law they dislike. 
Ohio’s Republican overlords openly defy the state constitution on redistricting and abortion rights to get their way no matter what a majority of folks in their state wants.
Question is, will voters cede self-governance for team loyalty at the ballot box, or will they demand due respect from the elected representatives who work for them and loyalty to the rule of law over party?

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Concerns that increased electricity rates could force seniors and other Mainers living on fixed incomes to choose between heating their homes, buying sufficient food or filling their prescriptions drove more than a dozen people to come out Tuesday evening to oppose a new proposal from Central Maine Power.
At the Freeport Hilton Garden Inn, the Public Utilities Commission held the first of two public hearings on the private utility’s new five-year rate proposal, which included investments meant to improve reliability and resiliency, as well as improvements to customer experience. The plan, which was officially submitted in mid-September, is projected to increase the company’s revenue by more than $430 million. 
If approved, the plan could increase rates for the average customer by $35 per month or $420 per year by 2030. About half of that increase ($17) would be felt as soon as October 2026. 
In its request, CMP listed expanded customer service operations, tree-trimming and changes to storm cost recovery as the main drivers of the cost increase. 
“The last thing working Mainers need is executives in expensive suits telling them that $35 a [month] is no big deal,” said Troy Jackson, a Democratic candidate for governor and former Maine State Senate president, who testified at the hearing. 
During the hour of public testimony, no one voiced support for the proposal.
David Bilski, a CMP customer who lives in Bristol, said he and his wife estimated that their annual costs could increase by more than $800 because their electricity usage is double that of the average customer due to their high-efficiency heat pumps.
While they are happy with their choice to replace their oil-fired boiler, that increase would be “crazy” for them on a fixed income. 
Gov. Mills opposes CMP plan that could raise average annual electricity costs by more than $400

John Glowa, another gubernatorial candidate who is running as an independent, said he has a wood stove that heats half of his house and he’s lucky that at 71 years old he can still work when he needs to. But, he wondered, if the rate hike goes forward, “How many are going to shiver in cold homes because they are trying to save money for rent, food or medicine?”
Commission Chair Phil Bartlett told the crowd Tuesday night that it could take a year to work through this case, so a decision as to whether the proposal will be approved or not isn’t expected until late next summer. After a second public hearing in Hallowell Wednesday evening, the commission plans to hold a series of technical meetings to gather more details. 
The proposed rate hike comes as Mainers are already seeing a significant uptick in their power bills.
The average CMP residential customer paid roughly $155 in August, up from $140 this time last year. Customers in Versant’s Bangor Hydro District saw their bills go up just over $20 this past year, from $148 to $169, while the average Versant Maine Public District consumer saw their bill increase from about $144 to $162.
Earlier in the day, Jackson held a press conference in Portland to voice his opposition to CMP’s proposal. He said he was floored when he saw the rate increase it would place on Mainers, like sisters Mary Tardiff and Kathy Davis, who live in Lewiston. 
Tardiff, who also spoke at the press conference, shared how she bought her dream home in Lewiston about six years ago but has since faced a series of unexpected expenses — such as having to replace her roof after the winter storms in 2023 and 2024 — and cost increases that have caused her to question whether she can afford to stay. 
In an effort to keep their grocery bills down, Tardiff tripled the size of her garden this year so she would have extra to can and share with Davis, who lives nearby.
The women are worried that a proposed rate increase will only exacerbate the strain they have felt on their fixed incomes in recent years.
Gov. Janet Mills has also publicly opposed the rate hike, calling the request “massive and unacceptable.”
She said the proposal undermines legislation that she signed in 2022, which requires utility companies to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience while taking into account the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers. 
CMP has said its plan is designed to build a “smarter, stronger, more resilient grid,” so it can better serve customers by reducing associated costs from potential storms and supporting a switch to clean energy.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)It’s always stirring to watch Interstate 80 swell with fans on a Saturday. But this fall, the university that the Big Red faithful pass on their way to Memorial Stadium teeters on a slope to academic devastation.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett’s proposal to eliminate six academic programs —including the entire Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department — is no routine budget balancing. It signals the potential collapse of Nebraska’s claim to having a flagship university worthy of the name.
Think about it.
As Nebraskans, we’re proud of the land, the water and the skies overhead. We’re proud of the crops that grow on the land. Are we going to sit back and watch our university eliminate its meteorology and geology programs in an agricultural state increasingly battered by climate extremes? Are we going to watch it downsize entomology and plant pathology while insects and viruses attack crops?
The proposed $27.5 million in cuts would save money in the short term while costing Nebraska immeasurably in the long run. UNL’s Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department has led groundbreaking research in Antarctic climate studies. Its faculty and graduates contribute directly to understanding the weather patterns that affect every farmer, every insurance company, every utility and every planner in our state.
And that’s just one facet. Eliminating this department would not just cost us 12 faculty positions, it would cost us institutional knowledge, talent and research capacity that took decades to build and would take decades to rebuild.
The same logic applies to statistics, educational administration, science teaching, landscape architecture and other targeted programs. In an age when data science drives innovation and educational leadership shapes the workforce of tomorrow, these cuts would leave Nebraska less competitive, not more efficient.
It’s late in the game. But rather than accepting these destructive cuts as inevitable, let’s band together and be creative. We can preserve these vital programs until lawmakers reconsider their priorities. The University of Nebraska Foundation, with its substantial endowment and fundraising capacity, could establish an emergency academic preservation fund to bridge the current funding gap. Donors small and large could come to the rescue. I would be among them. Others, too.
Consider the math: The six academic programs targeted for elimination would save $7.7 million annually. A $15.4 million emergency fund could preserve all of them for two years and represents less than 4% of the $389 million the foundation raised last year from over 50,000 donors. If it were sports at stake, you know we’d do it. Don’t academics deserve the same?
This emergency fund would maintain threatened academic programs for two years while the Nebraska Legislature reassesses its commitment to invest in the state’s land-grant university mission. It would give NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold and his team a chance to better make the evident case that, far from being bloated or overly “woke,” our university is underfunded yet productive for all Nebraskans.
If we allow these cuts to proceed, we will join the ranks of states that have hollowed out their flagship universities in the name of fiscal responsibility, only to discover that they’ve undermined their economic competitiveness. We’ll watch other, savvier states recruit the best of the faculty and grad students we’re dismissing, develop the research partnerships we’re abandoning and attract the businesses that need the expertise we’re eliminating.
An emergency preservation fund wouldn’t just save academic programs, it would send a powerful message about Nebraska’s values and ambitions. It would avoid a fumble in our ambition to rejoin the American Association of Universities. It would demonstrate that we understand the connection between research universities, innovation and economic development, between academic excellence and the talent retention that keeps our brightest young people in state. It would make Go Big Red mean the whole state wins.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-15 04:01:45+00:00,CT Mirror,Belonging is the battlefield: pass HB 5002.,Melvin Medina,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/15/belonging-is-the-battlefield-pass-hb-5002/,This is where policy meets bad faith and the result is stalling and stagnation. We don’t lack ideas. We lack moral clarity and resolve.,"This past summer, Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed a major housing bill that would have helped build more homes across Connecticut. His message? Local voices matter. Towns should take the lead.
And I wondered – which voices, exactly? And lead in what direction?

Melvin Medina
It’s now been months since that veto. No special session has been called. And while lawmakers are still working to tweak and refine HB 5002, one truth remains: we can adjust a bill’s language, but unless we’re willing to fight for belonging, we’ll never change the outcome.
I live in Woodbridge, a town held hostage by what I call the No-Growth, No-Opportunity Coalition. If local voices matter to the governor, then I want him to hear this: we aren’t just fighting over buildings, we’re fighting over belonging.
At least, that’s what my dad taught me.
My father was a janitor. He worked in a school, mopping floors, cleaning bathrooms, and keeping the grounds. He loved what he did. As a child, I didn’t understand why.
Some summers, I tagged along – his quiet way of instilling in me a pride in work. One day I asked why he cared so much about mopping floors and replacing urinal cakes. He smiled, saw through my question, and gave me a lesson I’ll never forget:
“I’m not just taking care of floors or bathrooms,” he said. “I’m caring for what happens inside that building – the teachers, the students, the lives being shaped every day. The future. That’s what’s within these walls. That’s what I’m nurturing. Potential.”
That’s how I think about housing. The buildings matter, yes – but what matters most is who gets to live inside them: families, children, futures shaped by access. When opponents block housing, they’re not rejecting walls or blueprints. They’re rejecting people – and their potential.
That’s why housing debates are so charged. I’ve seen it firsthand in Woodbridge, during a recent town meeting where Democrats and Republicans, usually divided, stood united in one effort: blocking a proposed 96-unit apartment building through procedural delay.
It was another reminder that some towns aren’t leading. They’re being held hostage by fear, by a coalition that thrives on saying no.
On my drive home that night, beneath the black oaks reaching toward the stars, something painful settled in. Long before my family arrived, this town had already said no to my child.
The objections I’d heard that night weren’t new. They followed a familiar playbook: process complaints. Traffic fears. Appeals to “neighborhood character.” Invocations of conservation and the environment. And finally, the hardest one to hear: the claim that there would be too many children.
Some concerns — like traffic, environmental impact, or school capacity — can and should be addressed. But appeals to “character” and “aesthetics” are different. They’re vague by design, impossible to measure, and often used to preserve exclusion without saying so outright.
This is the intersection where policy meets bad faith and the result is stalling and stagnation. We don’t lack ideas. We lack moral clarity and resolve.
Consider the scale: Connecticut needs more than 100,000 affordable housing units to meet demand – most of it from lifelong residents priced out of their own communities. Yet in 2024, the state completed just 1,335 state-financed homes — a 33% drop from the previous year, and reportedly the lowest total in more than a decade. That’s not progress. That’s failure by delay.
HB 5002 was a step in reversing that trajectory — not by stripping local control, but by incentivizing towns to take action, offering tools and resources to those willing to build.
We must ask: Can a town truly lead if it’s captive to curators of “taste” — neighbors who cloak exclusion in the language of character, aesthetics, and tradition?
Governor Lamont says local voices matter. I’m asking which ones. The tastemakers? Or the families priced out of opportunity?
Too often, the loudest voices in the room aren’t speaking in good faith. And the people who most need housing? They’re not in the room at all.
Some towns aren’t planning for growth — they’re planning for delay, cloaked in the language of process. And delay, repeated enough, becomes policy by default.
I think often of my dad, who passed during the pandemic. His lesson still guides me: see past the brick and mortar, and focus on the people, the possibility, the futures inside.
That’s what we should be fighting for. That’s what belonging looks like.
But I worry we’re not having the right conversation. Too often, even local Democrats mistake process for progress. They speak the language of inclusion while quietly backing efforts to stall or kill projects. They don’t see that by opposing density, they’ve become part of the very problem we claim to be solving.
We’re not short on ideas or policy tools. What we’re missing is moral clarity.
Because belonging isn’t neutral or static. It must be an active political value — one that both parties can champion.
If we believe in opportunity, in fairness, in a future where working families can thrive, then access to homes people can afford must be central. Some would say: build where it’s easiest. I say: build also where it matters, in communities that offer working families a promise of opportunity.
Yes, HB 5002 may be amended. But the final bill must do more than change words — it must be a step toward changing outcomes. It must free communities held hostage to bad-faith obstruction and performative processes.
Because when we block homes, we’re not preserving our towns. We’re narrowing their future.
Leadership isn’t about letting towns say no — it’s about helping them say yes.
Call the special session, Governor. Moderate exclusion, not opportunity.
That’s how you fight for belonging. That’s how we create more homes people can afford.

“Several houses floated miles inland – some with people still inside. There are a few houses still intact on higher ground on one side of the village. Everyone else has lost their homes or are facing extensive damage,” Jacqui Lang of Kipnuk wrote on Facebook. 
Residents posted photos and updates on Facebook, sharing prayers and connecting with family and friends. Some had minimal battery power, as utilities were knocked out by the storm.
Some filmed U.S. Coast Guard helicopters rescuing residents from homes floating away in nearby waters – 51 residents were rescued from the hardest-hit communities of Kwigillingok and Kipnuk on Sunday and Monday.
“WE MADE IT OUT OF KIPNUK! Everyone’s good and at the school. The Coast Guard just picked us up and just landed into Bethel,” wrote Kristy Fox of Kipnuk, along with videos of helicopter rescues. “Kipnuk isn’t Kipnuk anymore. I pray they evacuate safely.”
The storm killed one woman in Kwigillingok, left two missing and displaced over 1,000 people. 
Hundreds took shelter in local schools as vast flooding and winds had damaged homes, structures, boats roads, and boardwalks. 
Damage is still being assessed. Emergency crews were deployed to assist with repairing damaged runways, power and sewer infrastructure and begin evacuating and airlifting residents to shelter in Bethel as of Tuesday.

(Provided by the Montana Department of Corrections)The Department of Corrections announced late Tuesday it had identified three water leaks at the prison.
The Department of Corrections discovered a “water pipe break” at 6 a.m. on Friday, and an inmate and family members have said conditions have grown dire since, with a lack of drinking water and unsanitary conditions.
An inmate at the Montana State Prison and family members of people who are incarcerated said Tuesday there has been no heat in some parts of the facility and at least one unit flooded.
Late Tuesday, however, the DOC said it was making progress on the fix. To test the system for additional leaks, the DOC said its maintenance team is repressurizing and monitoring the system.
“We took a step forward today by confirming where several leaks were located,” DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in the news release late Tuesday. “Even though we found these leaks, we are still working to repair them and resolve the situation for inmates. We’re going to continue evaluating the system and sourcing water and resources for the facility.” 
Tuesday, the morning forecast called for a low of 27 degrees in Deer Lodge, and an inmate, Josh McKnight, estimated the temperature inside at about 50 degrees.

“The heat systems run water through the walls, and the heaters are on the walls,” McKnight said in a phone call Tuesday with the Daily Montanan. “And without water, there’s nothing there.”
A DOC spokesperson said Tuesday she had received questions from the Daily Montanan about the lack of heat and flooding but had not responded to them by press time.
But in the news release Tuesday, the DOC said to ensure services for inmates and staff, 133 portable toilets are on site at MSP along with 43 mobile shower units. The DOC said toilets and showers are pumped and cleaned continuously throughout the day. 
“Staff are working to keep normal inmate services running and are prioritizing the delivery of resources where they are needed most critically,” the news release said. “To assist with security efforts, Probation and Parole officers and correctional officers from the Montana Women’s Prison are on site.”
In a Monday afternoon update, the state agency said a second “leak detection consultant” had arrived at the facility from Bozeman. The Department of Corrections also said a second National Guard team had been called to help out with water delivery. 
The National Guard tankers will begin running a 24-hour service to help refill the main water tank at the prison, the press release said. More than 200,000 gallons have been delivered, the state press release stated.
An inmate and family members earlier said they were concerned about the lack of water for drinking and cleaning themselves and their inability to shower. Tuesday, however, McKnight said hand sanitizer had been made available.
“We know this is a challenging situation and recognize the urgency felt by inmates and their families to resolve this as soon as possible. We share that sense of urgency,” Gootkin said in the Monday news release. 
McKnight is in a medical unit at the prison and while he’s not as worried about himself, there are older and frail inmates he’s concerned about, including one who is, “completely paralyzed, and he can’t do anything.” 
Josh McKnight’s wife, Amanda, has spent the last couple of days glued to her screen trying to get help for those currently incarcerated and helping organize a tightly knit group of family members with loved ones in prison to advocate for those dealing with the water pipe issue.
Amanda McKnight, who also runs a Facebook page called 406 Revolutionized, said food has been a concern, as inmates are worried about whether it is being cooked with water that is safe. 
Kenzie Lincoln, whose husband, Bryce Baltezar, is currently at the Deer Lodge facility, said fights have caused lockdowns, which prevent people from going to the bathroom – the portable toilets are in the yard. 
On Monday night, Baltezar’s unit flooded, and it took over an hour to get a response from guards, said Lincoln, who has been in regular communication with her husband. The prisoners had no idea if the water was safe to be in or around, she added. One flooded unit was the Special Housing Unit, and the other was the Administrative Segregation Unit, she said.
“He’s spent five years in and out of prison, and he sees that, you know, a lot of times, issues don’t get fixed, even small issues,” Lincoln said. “ … He said (last night,) ‘I wish that God would just take me in my sleep. I can’t do this anymore.’.”
Portable showers have been delivered to the prison. The showers quickly broke, McKnight said, and she has gone so far as to reach out to a company that could bring in showers for the prison.

Tuesday afternoon, Josh McKnight said he was told by prison staff that they were in the process of setting up shower tents outside. The DOC said in the late afternoon news release it had 43 mobile shower units.
“There’s 160 men living that haven’t showered in six days,” McKnight said. “Not a good smell.”
He and family members also report that portable toilets have been vandalized, and they have had health and sanitation concerns about dirty facilities inside the prison.
The Department of Corrections reported the leak to prisoners early on Oct. 10, with inmates and families describing a “crisis” on the ground in the prison.
The water pipe break has drawn a large response from various state agencies, and on Monday, a County Assist Team (CAT) from Disaster Emergency Services and Department of Natural Resources and Conservation is now helping to plan, logistics, and incident follow-up. That team is often used on wildfires across the state.
Additional personnel from the Montana State Women’s Prison arrived on Tuesday, according to the Department of Corrections. They join probation and parole officers from the surrounding area, which included some from Missoula and Helena.
On Tuesday, Brigadier General Trenton Gibson, who is Adjutant General for the State of Montana and serves as Commander of the Montana National Guard and the Director of the Department of Military Affairs, visited National Guard troops at MSP, the DOC said. He also met with Gootkin and MSP Warden Jim Salmonsen.

(Courtesy of Brad Johnson)It’s harvest time in South Dakota and for nearly 140,000 pheasant hunters, it is an opportunity to wander fields of grass, edges of wetlands and pockets of overgrown weeds.
All across the state, farmers are growing and selling corn, wheat, soybeans, cattle and other products, contributing billions of dollars to the state’s economy. 
Hunters this fall will likely harvest more than 1.3 million pheasants, 47,000 deer, 220,000 ducks, and 300,000 geese in South Dakota, along with antelope, elk, grouse, turkey, rabbits and other wildlife. Our beautiful landscape and abundant wildlife provide a huge boon to local communities as hunters fill hotel rooms and restaurants. 
These twin economic pillars — farming and tourism — both benefit greatly from the federal farm bill and its voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs. These programs provide farmers with funds and advice needed to put in place much-needed systems that conserve our soil, water and wildlife. 
Thune files bipartisan bill to strengthen federal conservation program

In South Dakota, about 80% of the land is privately owned, which means the vast majority of sportsmen and women are hunting in habitat on private lands.
Most landowners want to be good stewards, but many do not have resources to create or restore wildlife habitat. Through the farm bill, the U.S. Department of Agriculture can help provide those resources.
In July, Congress extended four major farm bill conservation programs, and in a big win for wildlife, increased the long-term funding for the programs by about 50%. 
Congress also extended some smaller programs like the Voluntary Public Access & Habitat Incentives Program that has supported our state’s Walk-in Area Program, which provides hunting access on more than 1.25 million acres. 
Unfortunately, the Conservation Reserve Program — which turns 40 years old this year — was the one major farm bill conservation program that did not get extended in July. It and many other farm bill programs expired on Sept. 30. 
Until Congress finishes the work to write a new farm bill or extends the current one, USDA will be unable to enroll any new acres in CRP contracts. CRP is a popular and effective tool that helps farmers protect existing grassland or plant marginal cropland with grasses, shrubs and trees. The program has three major purposes: soil conservation, wildlife habitat and water quality.
According to a March 2024 report on pheasant management by the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks, “the CRP represents one of the most successful conservation programs ever implemented in the United States.”
To complicate matters, when Congress failed to pass a funding bill before Oct. 1 and the government shut down, USDA sent 96% of its conservation employees home and closed offices around the country.
USDA even stopped issuing checks, like the annual CRP payments to landowners that were supposed to go out Oct. 1. USDA has already lost nearly one-quarter of its conservation staff since the new administration took over in January, and the government shutdown will put USDA employees even further behind and make life more difficult for farmers. 
South Dakota’s hunters, anglers, farmers and ranchers are some of the top beneficiaries of CRP in the country, with over 2.6 million acres enrolled in the program. CRP contracts bring over $145 million annually to more than 14,000 South Dakota landowners. That doesn’t include the myriad other benefits from the program, like the boost in the outdoor economy that comes from the wildlife produced on those lands.
Over 542,000 acres of CRP contracts in South Dakota are wetlands, providing nesting and migratory habitat for ducks, geese and other waterfowl. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates CRP acres in the northern Great Plains add about 2 million ducks to the fall flight every year.
Despite the popularity and success of CRP, Congress is considering proposals that would reduce the program’s benefits for producers, outdoors enthusiasts and wildlife. The program doesn’t need a major overhaul. It just needs a few common-sense improvements.


Let us know what you think...


 

Thankfully, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, and Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, and Tina Smith, D-Minnesota, recognize the benefits of the program and its value. They introduced the Conservation Reserve Improvement and Flexibility Act, which would add to the program’s ability to meet producer needs. 
The bill would streamline the application process for CRP State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement, an increasingly popular option in South Dakota where over 235,000 acres are planted to grass species that benefit pheasants and other grassland birds. 
Their bill would provide federal payments for fencing and water facilities to encourage sounder grazing of CRP acres and would increase the annual limit on CRP payments that has not been raised since CRP was created in 1985.
The CRP Transition Incentives Program has already helped more than 2,900 farmers acquire over 400,000 acres of expiring CRP land nationwide, but the program could do even more to help new and beginning farmers if Congress would prioritize them in awarding new CRP contracts as it now does for other USDA conservation programs. With some minor changes, CRP could also be a stronger tool for establishing and maintaining migratory corridors for wildlife. 
As members of Congress consider these and other changes to the program, they should ensure there are no cuts. We need more CRP acres, not less.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_20251007_164618-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 21:56:47.581291

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A nonprofit group behind a handful of Nebraska ballot initiatives announced a campaign Tuesday to gather signatures for two new ones aimed at conservative election goals. 
One would alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president, giving all five to the winner of the popular vote statewide. The other would require elections in the state to be conducted exclusively using paper ballots counted by hand.
The group, Advocates for All Nebraskans, is now collecting signatures for five ballot initiatives. The group, headlined by former leaders of the Nebraska Republican Party, argues that the initiatives are about reclaiming the state’s voice and promoting government accountability.
“This is not a partisan movement … This is a populist movement,” said Eric Underwood, the former chair of the Nebraska GOP who helped lead a populist takeover of the party in 2022. “We exist because many of us grew tired of waiting for solutions from the traditional status quo elected officials or political consultants.” 
Underwood, along with State Board of Education member Kirk Penner, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent Tom Nesbitt and former Lincoln talk radio host Doug Fitzgerald, are behind efforts to get the measures and constitutional amendments on the ballot in 2026. Group leaders say each proposal has grassroots support.
The winner-take-all constitutional amendment is identical to State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams’ legislative resolution this year on letting voters decide whether to shift the state to winner-take-all, which did not get scheduled for a vote. A separate proposal to make the change in statute from State Sen. Loren Lippincott, Legislative Bill 3, fell to a filibuster.

Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parse out some electoral votes by the winner in each congressional district. Winner-take-all has been on local conservative wish lists for decades, as Democrats have grown increasingly competitive in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. It has seen a resurgence as Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen tried and failed to get it passed. 
Pillen did a full-court press for a winner-take-all ahead of the 2024 presidential election — with President Donald Trump getting personally involved in calling and lobbying lawmakers, but the effort died after former Democratic State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, who had joined the GOP, opposed the change.
Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said, “Nebraskans made it clear last year they support our fair electoral system.” Kleeb and the Democrats have argued that Republicans only want to change the rules because the GOP keeps losing in the 2nd District, where Democrats have won three out of the last five presidential elections.
“Our elected officials should instead be training other states to follow Nebraska and Maine — the only two states in the nation that give all voters a voice and a fair shot,” Kleeb said. 
Civic Nebraska, a voting rights advocacy group, called both ballot initiatives “reckless, unnecessary, and fundamentally un-Nebraskan.”

“We are confident that Nebraskans will see these proposals for what they are: partisan schemes that would make our elections less secure, less fair and less reflective of the people,” said Steve Smith, a spokesperson for Civic Nebraska.
The proposed constitutional amendment for paper ballots and hand counting would ban many voting machines from being used. Voting machines that produce voter-verifiable paper records like Nebraska’s would be exempt. It would require all elections to be done by paper ballot by July 2027. 
The effort echoes the push by Trump and some Republicans over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election — an election former President Joe Biden won over Trump. Trump announced plans to “lead a movement” to get rid of mail-in ballots and voting machines ahead of next year’s midterm elections. 
Trump and his allies have sued multiple states alleging election fraud in 2020; all but one of the cases have not survived judicial scrutiny. 
“This petition simply codifies the most secure and publicly verifiable method of counting votes by prioritizing the manual counting of every ballot,”  Penner said. “We are setting a strong precedent that can be a trend setter for other states looking to restore public confidence in their election system.” 
Most voting experts agree that hand counting is less reliable, costlier and more time-consuming than counting by machine. The Texas Tribune and VoteBeat reported that a hand count of ballots in a rural central Texas county during the 2024 Republican primary took nearly 24 hours with 200 people involved. The hand-counting process cost taxpayers about twice the wages paid for the 2020 Republican primary and required fixing several errors. 
 Charles Herbster, who is flirting with another GOP bid for governor, criticized Pillen’s effort, saying that the change should have happened before the 2024 presidential election. He backs both ballot measures. 
“Governor Pillen and his team led people to believe he would get it done. They failed. Now, it’s up to the people,” Herbster said. 
Herbster lost to Pillen and then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha in a three-way Republican primary in 2022 and is a major Trump donor.

Local political observers are mixed on whether a winner-take-all ballot initiative would pass. Some rural Republicans have shared concerns about one day losing “their voice” under winner-take-all as the state becomes more urban and suburban.
Underwood said it’s unlikely there would ever be enough urban and suburban votes to overtake Nebraska’s more conservative rural voters. 
“We have and are fully prepared to have those discussions with our colleagues in the Republican Party who have questions or concerns about it,” Underwood said. 
The group would need to gather the signatures of 10 percent of the state’s registered voters for the winner-take-all initiative that would change the state constitution. The hand-counting ballot initiative would need 7 percent of the state’s registered voters, since that one is changing state law. Both have until July to get on the November 2026 ballot. Over the past decade, gathering signatures and campaigning for a successful petition effort in Nebraska has typically cost $1.5 million or more. 
“Now that all five of the petitions have been introduced, we are ready to mobilize,” Danna Seevers, a co-sponsor of the two ballot initiatives and Seward County GOP chair, said. “Let’s take to the streets to complete the mission to shape Nebraska’s future.”

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan (Alaska Beacon file photos)Alaska’s two U.S. senators are split on whether or not it is appropriate for the U.S. military to kill suspected drug smugglers without trial or a declaration of war.
On Tuesday, the federal government said it had killed another six people aboard a boat in international waters of the Caribbean Sea, with President Trump claiming on social media that they were drug smugglers.
Since Sept. 2, the U.S. military has killed 27 people in the Caribbean Sea without a declaration of war or criminal trial, according to statistics kept by the New York Times. 
In each case, the federal government has asserted without evidence that all the people killed aboard the boats were smuggling drugs.
Last week, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted to have the Senate vote on a resolution that would have ended the Caribbean Sea bombings unless approved by Congress.
Sixty votes were needed to call a vote. Only 48 senators — all Democrats, plus Murkowski and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky — voted in favor of bringing the issue to a vote. 
“While I commend the administration’s concerted efforts to address the devastation of drug trafficking on communities across the country, I do not believe the information I have received justifies this interpretation of the President’s Article II powers,” Murkowski said, referring to the section of the Constitution that names the president the commander in chief of the military.
“I take very seriously my Article I responsibility when it comes to Congress’s power to declare war. I don’t think that full information on the legal and factual justification for armed attacks on suspected drug traffickers is too much to ask,” Murkowski said.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, joined the rest of the Senate’s Republicans and Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania in voting to support the bombings.
Afterward, he offered a written statement explaining his vote.
“Days ago, I was briefed by Secretary of State Rubio on Venezuelan narcoterrorist cartels flooding our country with deadly drugs. Nicolás Maduro — the illegitimate leader of Venezuela and a criminal indicted by U.S. prosecutors — refuses to cooperate with the U.S. and is clearly aiding these vicious drug traffickers who are responsible for killing tens of thousands of Americans. President Trump’s lawful strikes against these cartels are saving lives and, importantly, establishing deterrence. Under Article II, he has the authority to defend our homeland, just as President George H.W. Bush did when he ordered the invasion of Panama in 1989 to remove the drug-trafficking dictator Manuel Noriega,” the statement said.
“Senate Democrats’ resolution was another attempt to restrict the President’s ability to act — emboldening cartels and putting American lives at risk. These senators would never tolerate ISIS or al-Qaeda operating freely near our shores: eliminating a terrorist organization like Tren de Aragua that is literally killing thousands of Americans is no different. More Americans have died from drug overdoses in the past seven years than in both World Wars and the Vietnam War combined. Alaskans know this devastation firsthand, as poisons like fentanyl tear apart families in our cities and Alaska Native villages. Eliminating these cartels before they reach our shores protects our county and sends a strong message of deterrence.”

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — Investigators could find no evidence former Rep. RJ May paid taxes for himself or his campaign consulting business during at least three of the years he spent in the House of Representatives, an attorney told the House Ethics Committee on Tuesday.
The committee began investigating the West Columbia Republican’s conduct in July, several weeks after his arrest on charges of sending videos of children being sexually abused. An investigation is usually the first step toward expelling a member from the House.
May resigned his House seat in August, while the investigation was ongoing. He pleaded guilty to five charges of distributing child sexual abuse material last month and is awaiting sentencing in the Edgefield County Detention Center.
Former Rep. RJ May pleads guilty to sending ‘disgusting and depraved’ child sex abuse videos

The complaint, first requested by House Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, went beyond May’s criminal charges.
Hiott asked the committee to look into his financials as well, which was what led a hired investigator to discover years of missing tax filings, said Mark Moore, an attorney with Maynard Nexsen, the law firm hired to look into the matter.
When attorneys requested May’s personal income tax filings and tax filings for his political consulting business, Ivory Tusk Consulting, the Department of Revenue came back with nothing, Moore said.
Ivory Tusk Consulting was not registered with the Secretary of State, suggesting May might have been operating it as a sole proprietorship, a business model that would require him to report his business’ income alongside his personal income on his tax returns. However, May seemed to have filed neither for tax years 2022 to 2024, Moore said.
“I think the conclusion is easy to draw there, and you don’t need me to draw it,” Moore said.
It’s unclear why the investigation didn’t include 2021, May’s first year in office. But it was 2022 when May helped launch the hardline-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House — as a chapter of the Washington, D.C.-based State Freedom Caucus Network — ran primary campaigns to oust his fellow Republicans, and drove an increasingly public schism with the GOP majority caucus.
The investigators did not try to get May’s federal tax returns, since the federal treasurer’s office wouldn’t have to comply with a state investigation in the same way as a state agency, he said.
The law firm’s investigator also raised concerns that May didn’t disclose all he should have on a financial statement he submitted to a federal judge asking for a public defender to represent him in court.
May claimed he had no assets other than his pickup truck, leading federal Magistrate Shiva Hodges to appoint him a team of two taxpayer-funded attorneys. May later fired his attorneys and opted to represent himself, though his public defenders will take over the case again for his sentencing hearing.
In calls and messages from his jail cell, however, May claimed candidates whose campaigns he ran, including sitting members of the Freedom Caucus, owed him tens of thousands of dollars. May didn’t specify exactly how much he felt was missing, but the amount was at least $50,000, according to jail communication records provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
May should have reported that money to the judge as an asset, but the attorneys investigating him determined he did not, Moore said.
“Obviously, courts expect people when they seek appointed counsel to be truthful with them in financial affidavits,” Moore told the committee. “As our investigation revealed, that did not happen here.”
Providing false information to a judge could be a felony, Moore said.
The committee found May “acted in a manner unbecoming of the House of Representatives,” Rep. Robby Robbins, R-Summerville, said. The eight committee members present agreed unanimously to issue a public reprimand against May for sending the videos.
“The whole thing is a sad and dark moment in that I served, as we served, with an individual who is engaging in some of the most reprehensible conduct imaginable,” said Ethics Chairman Jay Jordan, R-Florence.
May did not respond to the complaint or notices of meetings sent to him in jail, Jordan said. No attorney appeared at the meeting Tuesday to speak on May’s behalf.
Although May resigned his seat before the investigation reached a conclusion, the investigation was important in considering a then-sitting member’s activities, Jordan said.
A public reprimand will do little to May, who faces as many as 100 years in prison, but it allowed the committee to document its findings, Jordan said.
“Had we been able to kick him out, we would have, but we couldn’t because he had removed that opportunity from us,” Jordan said.
The committee voted unanimously to refer any possible criminal violations to a state agency equipped to handle them. Jordan declined to say what agency that might be, saying it will be up to another agency to decide whether to pursue charges.
The committee also voted to refer complaints about two people to the State Ethics Commission for review as to whether they violated ethics law. Jordan declined to say who those people are or what charges they face.
Other members of the Freedom Caucus, of which May was a founding member, came under scrutiny during the investigation, Moore said. While looking into May’s consulting business, attorneys wanted to interview some of the biggest contributors to his business, including current caucus members, he said.
Some agreed to cooperate, including voluntarily handing over financial reports and bank statements. Others declined to participate in the investigation, even when attorneys issued subpoenas, Moore said.
Three Freedom Caucus members — Chairman Jordan Pace, R-Goose Creek; Rep. Jay Kilmartin, R-Irmo; and Rep. Stephen Frank, R-Greenville — either did not respond to requests for interviews with attorneys or failed to follow through with scheduled meetings, Moore said.
When reached by the SC Daily Gazette, Frank, Kilmartin and Pace all asked if they could respond later.
When attorneys sat down with the members’ attorneys, they refused to answer questions, saying they did not believe their clients had to respond to hired counsel, an assertion the hired lawyers did not believe to be correct, Moore said.
The refusal to cooperate likely postponed the investigation’s results by at least a month, coming at what Moore said was a “significant” cost to taxpayers, though he didn’t say how much.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-14-at-7.25.45-PM.png,,,2025-10-14 20:57:50.817594

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of North Dakota lawmakers this week began sifting through an ocean of recommendations for how to spend a $500 million federal rural health care grant as the state races to meet a Nov. 5 application deadline.
The state will have a number of complex decisions to make — including how to weigh the public’s priorities against the kinds of initiatives encouraged by the federal government, a top human services official told legislators Tuesday.
Congress created the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program this summer as part of its 10-year budget reconciliation law. Members of Congress pitched the program as a means to offset losses rural states will suffer from federal cuts to Medicaid approved elsewhere in the bill.
The money can be used for areas including behavioral health, workforce, infrastructure development and disease prevention.
North Dakota must submit budgets for how it plans to use its share of the funds to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by Nov. 5.

While every state will get at least $500 million from the program, they’re eligible for more money, too.
The federal government will award supplemental funding based on certain state demographics, like the size of North Dakota’s rural population and the percentage of health services that go uncompensated because no payment is received by a patient or insurer, said Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the Department of Health and Human Services. She said North Dakota doesn’t score very high under this criteria compared to other states, though.
“Going into the scoring for supplemental funding, we’re starting from behind,” Aker told lawmakers on Tuesday.
The federal government is also awarding additional money based on the quality of states’ proposals. For example, if North Dakota demonstrates in its application that the initiatives it starts through the grant are sustainable and will continue even after federal funding runs out, the state may get more funding, Aker said.
Some complicating factors are that the state can’t use the money to build or purchase buildings, or to replace funding for programs already approved by the Legislature, among other restrictions. 
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services has spent the last few months working on the state’s application, including by gathering public input and by researching how the state can maximize its funding award. Those efforts included issuing a survey, conducting public listening sessions and consulting with tribal leaders, Aker said.

The public’s top priorities are expanding workforce recruitment and retention, health care access and chronic disease prevention, said Aker.
Many North Dakotans said they lack basic emergency services or health care facilities in their towns.
 “Lost my father when he was 57 due to heart attack and it took the ambulance 45 minutes to arrive to assist, but it was too late,” said one survey response highlighted by the agency.
One way the grant could address this is by funding a program to put at least one first responder in all 1,800 townships in the state, Aker said.
North Dakota lawmakers eye special session in January or February for federal rural health funding

Rep. Jayme Davis, a Rolette Democrat and member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, said the state has no shortage of good recommendations for how to use the money. She highlighted expanding opportunities for health care education at North Dakota’s tribal colleges and investing in mobile health clinics and medical detox centers as particularly of interest.
It will be hard to decide how to divvy up the funds, Davis noted.
“The more we add, the thinner the money stretches,” she said.
The federal government has also indicated it will award more money to states with certain policies, like those that restrict the use of food stamps for non-nutritious foods. Aker said Health and Human Services is working on putting such a restriction in place.
The federal funding is expected to be awarded to states by the end of the year. Lawmakers anticipate convening in January or February for a special session to authorize the state to spend the grant money.
Because the Department of Health and Human Services already hosted listening sessions, the committee did not take public comment on Tuesday.
The 33-member committee will meet Wednesday to continue discussing the application. 
Chair Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said on Wednesday the committee will consider whether or not to ask Legislative Council to draft policy bills that could improve the state’s application score.
He said another potential action item is considering a motion to submit formal application recommendations to the Department of Health and Human Services. The committee has set aside Oct. 21 for an additional meeting if needed.

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Gov. Spencer Cox announced his new Utah Supreme Court Justice pick to replace outgoing Associate Chief Justice John Peace on the bench. Third District Judge John Nielsen now awaits confirmation from the Utah Senate to join the high court. 
Cox said that after reviewing dozens of applications, hours of interviews exploring the candidates’ judicial philosophy and temperament, and examining many of their arguments and decisions, he’s confident in his choice.

The governor appointed Nielsen to the 3rd District Court in September 2024 after his work in different private ventures — including a joint firm with former Utah Associate Chief Justice Thomas Lee, Sen. Mike Lee’s brother. Nielsen also worked 11 years as solicitor general in the Utah Attorney General’s Office, and years as an adjunct associate professor at the University of Utah.

Before taking the district court judgeship, Nielsen and Lee’s law firm was hired by then-Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes to represent the state against a lawsuit challenging Utah’s transgender students sports ban, according to KUTV, a contract that became effective hours after Lee retired from the Utah Supreme Court and days after Nielsen resigned from the Attorney General’s Office.
“When you read anything written by Judge Nielsen, whether as a judge or as an attorney in the private sector, what we will soon find is that he is absolutely brilliant,” Cox said in a news conference at the state Capitol. “He’s one of the smartest people that I’ve ever interviewed.”
Chief Justice Matthew Durrant praised the state’s rigorous selection process, arguing that Pearce, who’s retiring on Dec. 1, is evidence of how good the system is. Nielsen is also “a strong testament” to the strength of the judicial selection process, Durrant added.

“I have been on the Supreme Court for 25 years now. For a good chunk of those years, I had a chance to see John Nielsen regularly argue before our court,” Durrant said. “And in those 25 years, I have never seen a better oral and written advocate. His writing has always been impeccable, honest, to the point.”
Nielsen said his judicial philosophy is “textualist” and “originalist,” saying that essentially means “trying to ensure that your interpretation fits with the intent of the law. In the case of statute, textualism, the will of the Legislature. In the case of the Constitution, the will of the people.”
That was an important factor in Cox’s selection, he said. 
“There’s a right way and a less appropriate way to decide cases and to interpret those laws,” Cox said. “And I feel very strongly that a textualist and originalist approach is the only way to anchor our system in a way that doesn’t lead to eventual chaos. Judges are not supposed to write laws or make up laws. That is the role of the legislative branch.”
Also, Cox said, now that the state is growing, district judges have had to take on larger workloads with little time. It’s something that Nielsen has proven to be able to do, Cox said.
During the 2025 legislative session, some lawmakers criticized the Utah Supreme Court as “woefully unproductive,” pointing to the number of opinions issued in 2023 and 2022 in comparison to other states. A director of communications for the Utah State Courts disputed that representation, arguing that “comparing volumes of published opinions between states is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Different courts have different structures and publish different things.”
Former Utah House Majority Leader Jefferson Moss said he was looking to expand the five-member Utah Supreme Court over “growing caseloads, delays, and evolving legal complexities in Utah’s highest court.”
Moss opened a bill file but, with little time left in the session, the proposal ultimately was never discussed
Cox said that’s something he has been thinking about lately because of the growing caseload in the state courts. 
“It’s not because of our court members. It’s just because of the sheer caseload,” Cox said. “And so I think it’s worth exploring how we get them additional resources that they might need.”

Green resigned this week after those indictments, the office's first, were tossed out. (Screenshot from Attorney General's Office video)The Maryland attorney general’s office is looking for a new leader for its police oversight unit, after its top two staffers resigned, the office confirmed Tuesday.
The office posted a job opening Tuesday for a new division chief at the Independent Investigations Division, the unit that handles all deaths involving law enforcement in Maryland — and which recently gained the authority to prosecute police officers.
The staffing changes come after the division’s first set of officer indictments were tossed out last month by an Anne Arundel County Circuit Court judge.
IID Chief Allison Green and deputy chief Renee Martel Joy “have resigned and will remain with the Office through the end of this week,” according to a statement from Jennifer Donelan, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office. She said Jonathan Smith, chief of the office’s Civil Rights Division, will serve as IID interim leader “while a robust search for new leadership is underway.”
Asked whether the outcome of the Anne Arundel County case contributed to the staff shakeup, Donelan said the office “does not comment on personnel matters.”
The job posting says the attorney general is “seeking an exceptional attorney to lead one of its most consequential and high-profile divisions: the Independent Investigations Division.”
“This is a rare opportunity to shape the future of public safety and accountability in Maryland,” it says. The posting seeks candidates with at least 10 years of experience in criminal prosecutions or defense, and offers a salary range of $135,418 to $191,453.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The role requires a skilled criminal trial lawyer and leader who brings vision and integrity to the work — someone who can implement and refine best practices in the handling of these complex and sensitive cases,” the posting states.
The new director will oversee an office that was created by the General Assembly in 2021 to evaluate and publish reports about all instances in which a person dies during an interaction with Maryland law enforcement officers.
But the Independent Investigations Division only gained the authority to prosecute officers it investigated in 2023; before that, it was up to local jurisdictions whether or not to charge officers involved in a death.
The first charges filed by IID with that new authority came in December 2024, when Anne Arundel County Police Cpl. Eddie Vasquez and Cpl. Kieran Schnell were indicted for a high-speed chase a year earlier that ended in a fatal crash.
In December 2023, Vasquez and Schnell, in separate cruisers, chased a vehicle with its headlights off traveling 92 mph on Fort Smallwood Road, which has a 35 mph speed limit. The chase went on for 2 miles and reached speeds of 109 mph before Meziah Johnson’s car hit a utility pole, killing his passenger, Damione Gardner, 22.
Johnson survived. Now 25, he has since pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter, drug possession and theft up to $25,000.
According to the indictment, neither Vasquez nor Schnell activated emergency lights or sirens, or their body-worn cameras, or contacted a supervisor. The pair “made factual misrepresentations and material omissions to [their] supervisors about the circumstances of the crash and concealed the occurrence,” prosecutors said. Vasquez and Schnell, who respectively had five and six years of service with the department, were charged with misconduct in office.
But during a hearing in September, Anne Arundel County Circuit Judge Stacy McCormack said the state failed to reach the burden of proof necessary for the charges against the two officers to move forward.
McCormack also said that the state failed to prove it followed procedures to keep “compelled statements” — made by the officers during an internal affairs investigation — separate from the attorneys prosecuting the case. Under the law, prosecutors cannot see those “compelled statements” or use them in trial, due to officers’ rights protecting them from self-incrimination during questioning by their employer.
“The burden is an affirmative one,” McCormack said. “The AG must demonstrate that its evidence is not tainted by any direct or indirect exposures to the compelled testimony.”
“I think it’s very important to note that I understand that this is a serious case involving an accident where an individual lost his life,” McCormack said, before dismissing the charges.
At the time of the officers’ indictment, Anne Arundel County Police Chief Amal E. Awad said her department had investigated the incident and was “not aware of any conduct demonstrated by our officers that rises to the level of a violation of criminal law.” Once the charges were dismissed by McCormack, the department said that both Vasquez and Schnell were reinstated “to full-duty status” on the force.
“These are good officers,” Vasquez’s attorney Andrew Jezic said after the ruling. “Their main focus was getting these two guys out of the car and into the hands of the emergency personnel. This ruling could not have benefited finer, more dedicated officers and extremely nice young men.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Annapolis mayoral candidates Jared Littmann and Bob O’Shea agreed that the city should ensure equal opportunities are provided for all Annapolitans — at a forum focused strictly on questions about the city’s LGBTQ+ community, that was the easy part.
It was when they talked about how to get there that the answers got interesting.
While Littman, the Democrat, was quick to agree with about any question, O’Shea, the Republican, occasionally framed his answers in terms of the city budget, since a main theme of his campaign has been the need to reduce city spending.
The hourlong debate was sponsored by the Caucus of African American Leaders exactly three weeks before Election Day, at the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center. The winner of the Nov. 4 general election will succeed current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who has served two terms and is prohibited from running again.
A question on whether either candidate would commit to appointing an LGBTQ+ liaison in the mayor’s office was typical of the evening. O’Shea, citing the budget, said he would “need to look into it.”
“I will 100% meet with the community to discuss it,” O’Shea said. “Would I support having somebody that can be a touchstone in regards to where the community is? Yes, I do. But what I do need to do is figure out a way it’s efficient for the city and also is acceptable to the community, if that makes sense.”
Littmann said there should be a liaison, and if there is not one now, he would bring one on board.
“To be clear, this isn’t necessarily a full-time person that is doing this exclusively. Lots of people in the mayor’s office wear multiple hats, and that would continue,” Littmann said.

“But we absolutely should have someone designated in the mayor’s office, so that any employee feels like they have an issue to raise, they know who to go to in a safe space where they won’t have any penalty or harm brought against them for raising these issues,” he said.
Part of the question is based on a Human Rights Campaign Foundation municipal equality index scorecard last year that knocked the city for its failure to have a liaison in the mayor’s office. The city also got a zero on the scorecard for not providing “Transgender-Inclusive Healthcare Benefits” for transgender employees. However, the city did establish a LGBTQ liaison program in 2018 in the police department.
Overall, the city wound up getting a score of 95 out of 100 on the report.  Littmann said the fact that the annual Pride Parade — which is coming up this Saturday — is the city’s biggest parade is evidence of its acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.
Another question asked which position the candidates “would not be willing to compromise” to support LGBTQ+ residents against a federal executive order. One of the first orders President Donald Trump (R) issued on Jan. 20, the first day of second term in office, limited federal policy to two sexes, male and female, as a step toward doing away with “gender ideology extremism.”
“Executive orders that violate those [city] laws will be challenged in court,” Littmann said. “My job as mayor is to protect Annapolitans to enforce the laws that exist. Executive orders that violate those laws are not lawful orders.”
O’Shea said the laws coming from the federal government are hard to interpret, but “are laws that have to be abided by.”
“So what do we need to do? We need to enlighten them [residents] to make them understand is what you’re talking about correct,” he said.
“I will totally support the citizens and the residents of Annapolis, and I will do everything I can to make it so the people that are here know what the laws are and that we can figure out ways to help them,” O’Shea said.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)In the wake of recent bomb threats against New Mexico lawmakers, two Democratic state legislators asked state ethics officials to weigh in on whether lawmakers and political candidates are allowed to use campaign funds for “security expenses.”
The short answer, according to the New Mexico Ethics Commission, is yes. In an advisory opinion released Tuesday, the agency said candidates seeking public office can use campaign funds on security and, once elected, state legislators can as well, as long as in both cases the expenses were incurred as a direct result of campaign activity or holding public office.
New Mexico state Sen. Heather Berghmans (Albuquerque) and House Majority Leader Reena Szczepanski of Santa Fe—the latter one of the targets of the recent bomb threats—sought the opinion jointly.
“We wanted the extra clarification to know that if a legislator does feel the need to enhance security for their own houses or their personal situations, or if we need security at any events we’re holding, that we have the funds to pay for that type of enhancement in today’s political climate,” Berghmans told Source NM in a phone interview.
Szczepanski, who did not return messages to Source, was unavailable Tuesday to speak about the opinion, according to a spokesperson for New Mexico House Democrats.
The nine-page State Ethics Commission opinion rests on an analysis that began by considering state campaign laws and Secretary of State’s campaign regulations “to determine whether certain expenditures are expressly permitted or prohibited,” a statement provided to Source by the agency notes.
“Here, as with other expenditures the Commission has considered, ‘security expenses’ are not identified specifically as either. The Commission determined therefore that a candidate or legislator is not prohibited from using campaign funds for security expenses in the circumstances where the expenses are reasonably attributable to a campaign or, for legislators, to the performance of legislative duties, provided that the candidate or legislator would not have otherwise incurred the same security expenses even in the absence of the campaign or legislative office.”
The statement notes that the Commission also considered “comparable federal provisions that distinguish between legitimate campaign or legislative expenses and personal use” in its analysis.
As such, the opinion concludes that under those criteria, candidates and state lawmakers can use campaign funds for security purposes—ranging from hardware such as alarm systems to cybersecurity software to professional security personnel.
If candidates or lawmakers already have a security system in place prior to the campaign or holding office, paying for those with campaign funds would not be allowed, according to the opinion.
The opinion only applies to candidates and elected state legislators and not other public officials, which follows the same criteria as the state Campaign Reporting Act, which permits the use of campaign funds for “expenditures of the campaign” and “expenditures of legislators that are reasonably related to performing the duties of the office held.” The opinion notes that “this distinction is a policy decision made by the Legislature and arises perhaps because legislators receive no compensation beyond per diem and mileage whereas other public officeholders receive salaries.”
Berghmans said the inquiry about whether security costs were permissible was driven in part by recent threats against Szczepanski and Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, both of whom received emailed bomb threats on Sept. 11. While no explosives were found, the threats remain under investigation by local and national authorities.
The bomb threats, two of which came from an email account called “maga_terrorist,” followed a spate of political violence this year, including the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the assassination Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota Democratic lawmaker, and her husband.
Berghmans said that despite recent political violence, she believes New Mexico’s senators cultivate an atmosphere of “disagreeing without being super disagreeable,” pointing to recent bipartisan efforts to diffuse tension during the October two-day special session.
“I have never felt afraid to be running for public office or to be serving in it, but I know that’s changing for people, which is really unfortunate, in the United States,” Berghmans said. “Every step we can take additionally to make sure people feel safe and supported is what’s important.”
The Vote Mama Lobby, a national political action committee seeking to put more Democratic women with children into office, noted New Mexico is the 15th state to approve using campaign funds for security expenses. The PAC has previously endorsed both Berghmans and Szczepanski.
Vote Mama Lobby officials celebrated the opinion, calling it a “bipartisan acknowledgement of rising threats against public officials,” in a statement.
“Political violence is a direct threat to our democracy, and campaign funds for security is an important tool to counteract this growing problem. No one should ever have to choose between their safety and running for office,” CEO Liuba Grechen Shirley said in a statement.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Some foods such as soda and candy may soon be prohibited purchases in North Dakota through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, officials said Tuesday.
The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services plans to seek permission from the federal government to prohibit certain foods from being purchased with SNAP benefits. The proposal was mentioned Tuesday to a legislative committee but details are still being developed.
The move is part of an effort to secure more federal funding through the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. While states are guaranteed at least $500 million from the program, they can get more money if they enact certain policies the federal government favors.
States with pending or approved SNAP waivers that limit non-nutritious food purchases will be considered more competitive applicants, Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, told lawmakers. 
The agency plans to apply for the waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ahead of the Nov. 5 application deadline for the rural health funding.
“We’re working out the definitions so that the retail community can have a smooth transition, but we’re eliminating things that cause chronic disease, so candy and soda,” said Pat Traynor, interim Health and Human Services commissioner.
North Dakota legislative leaders expect special session for federal rural health care dollars

Traynor said the earliest the changes could affect North Dakota SNAP recipients is next year, and the new changes would take months to implement.
North Dakota had about 57,000 SNAP recipients in May, according to USDA data.
At least 12 states have received federal approval to restrict SNAP recipients from using their benefits to buy foods such as soda and candy, Stateline reported. Some states have restricted only soda, while others have included energy drinks, prepared desserts and other sugary drinks. The trend is related to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to “make America healthy again.”
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R-Hazelton, remarked during Tuesday’s legislative committee meeting that the government’s definition of what food is and isn’t healthy seems to differ over time.
“What if they ever classified beef as non-nutritious, or something to that effect?” he asked. “When they base the money on non-nutritious, that’s kind of a moving target.”
Aker said the state has control over how it defines non-nutritious food under the waiver.
A dozen states win approval to restrict soda, candy for SNAP recipients

Emily O’Brien, deputy commissioner for Health and Human Services, said the department is still working out which soda and candy products will be included in the waiver.
“We’re fine-tuning what the definitions look like,” O’Brien said. “We want to have buy-in, too, from our partners on implementation.”
John Dyste, president of the North Dakota Grocers Association, said he’s been in contact with state officials about the SNAP waiver and plans to meet with the department.
Dyste said he does not think prohibiting candy and soda from SNAP purchases would be difficult for grocery stores to implement, though may be more challenging for smaller stores without a point-of-sale system.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, said eliminating soda and candy from the SNAP program is a “fine idea,” and hoped it would give North Dakota’s application for the Rural Health Transformation Program a boost.
She also said she wants to be certain the state’s rural grocery stores are able to make the changes effectively without burdening their businesses.
“If the points of sale all have to be changed and it’s going to change the operations of the benefits, then they’ll get pushback for doing it,” Hogan said.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Attorney General Austin Knudsen has approved a second ballot initiative seeking to enshrine nonpartisan judicial elections into the Montana Constitution but has rewritten the language of the initiative, despite a lawsuit challenging a similar rewrite just weeks ago. 
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is one of two committees bringing ballot initiatives forward for the 2026 election related to judicial elections, submitting two propositions to voters. 
Both groups seek to keep judicial races in the state nonpartisan, as they have been required by state law since 1935. During the 2025 Legislature, Republican lawmakers made multiple attempts to make the state’s judicial elections into a partisan affair, saying they believe courts are already politicized and they want judges to disclose any affiliations. However, those attempts saw bipartisan opposition on nearly every proposed bill, except one allowing political parties to donate to judicial campaigns. 
Two initiatives, CI-132, by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, and CI-131, brought by Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, are close to identical, but MFIJ’s applies to district and state supreme court judges, while the MNC initiative broadly applies to all judicial races in the state, including future courts. 
When MFIJ’s initiative was approved by the Attorney General’s office in late September, it was also rewritten. 
The two groups filed a joint lawsuit with the Montana Supreme Court alleging that the rewritten statement is “misleading and prejudicial” and violates Montana statute.
Last week, Knudsen approved MNC’s petition as legally sufficient, but also rewrote the initiative to include the same language challenged in the lawsuit.  
“The Attorney General rewrote a simple, straightforward ballot statement simply because he doesn’t like the policy, attempting to prevent Montanans from having a fair chance to weigh in on how they want their judges elected,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said when the first lawsuit was filed. “The rewritten statement is deceptive and misleading to voters and a dangerous precedent to set for the ballot measure process in Montana.”
Butler told the Daily Montanan the same sentiment applies here, as the altered initiatives contain the same language. 
Representatives from Knudsen’s office did not respond to questions about the rewritten ballot initiatives on Tuesday. 
The original ballot statement submitted by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts states the following: 
“(The initiative) amends the Montana constitution to require that judicial elections remain nonpartisan.”
The rewrite changes the wording and adds the following: 
“(The initiative…) amends Article VII of the Montana Constitution to create a new Section 12 that mandates all judicial elections be nonpartisan. A nonpartisan election prohibits labeling candidates on the ballot according to the political party the candidate aligns with including labels like Independent.”
The line explaining a nonpartisan election was also inserted into CI-131, from the Fair and Impartial Judges committee. 
“We felt that they flipped the language on its head,” Butler said. “Whereas our initiative exists to protect the status quo, the current state of nonpartisanship, which we feel is the most transparent and right way to run an election, the new language is making it seem like the initiative exists to conceal bias, which is not our intent.”
In the lawsuit, attorneys for both committees said that Knudsen’s office is intentionally meddling with the wording in order to create confusion among voters. 
“The rewritten statement prejudicially and falsely tells voters to presume that judicial candidates are partisan actors aligned with a political party, and that voting for the initiative will have the effect of concealing this information,” the lawsuit said. “This is exactly the kind of argument — not description — that belongs in the ‘opponent arguments’ section of the Voter Information Pamphlet, not the ballot statement itself.”
The second initiative submitted by MNC, would require that judicial elections in Montana remain nonpartisan and includes additional language to extend that requirement to new courts created by the legislature. However, this proposal did not pass muster by Knudsen and was denied as legally insufficient last week. 
Butler said that Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts will file lawsuits with the Supreme Court in both cases, challenging the ballot rewrite of CI-132, and the attorney general’s finding of legal insufficiency on the other proposed initiative.
Butler said there is a precedent for the latter suit. 
Knudsen’s decision was based on a rule that ballot initiatives must involve a “single subject,” but Butler said extending a nonpartisan requirement in judicial elections to future courts falls within the single subject bounds. 
“We’re confident both of our initiatives are constitutionally sound,” Butler said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-10-14 19:57:58.883072

(Illustration by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The chairman and vice chairman of the Kansas Young Republicans took part in encrypted chats with political peers laced with violent, racist and antisemitic rhetoric and blended with references to white supremacy and suppression of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
On Tuesday, the chairman of the Kansas Republican Party said the Politico article disclosing the commentary prompted immediate deactivation of the Kansas Young Republicans organization.
Politico, a digital news company specializing in coverage of U.S. politics, reported Kansas Young Republicans chair Alex Dwyer and vice chair William Hendrix took part in the Telegram group chat.
In 2,900 pages of chat text, Hendrix praised the Missouri Young Republicans because leaders in that state didn’t like LGBTQ+ people. He repeatedly used racial slurs to refer to Black people, including words such as “n–ga” and “n–guh.” In a July conversation in the thread about African-Americans, he said, “Bro is at a chicken restaurant ordering his food. Would he like some watermelon and Kool-Aid with that?”
He was fired from a communications job in the office of Attorney General Kris Kobach as Politico prepared its report on Hendrix’s role in the chat.
“The comments in the chat are inexcusable,” Kobach said. “As soon as the office learned of those messages, Will Hendrix’s employment was terminated.”
In the chat threads, Dwyer and others delved into discussions of how GOP operatives could tarnish a political candidate by linking the individual to white supremacists. The idea was dismissed, Politico said, because the plan could backfire in a place such as Kansas where “Young Republicans could end up becoming attracted to that opponent.” Subsequently, a person in the chat asked others to guess what room number they had a hotel.
Dwyer responded: “1488.” That figure is a form of shorthand among white supremacists when making reference to their beliefs. It refers to the 14 words of text in the slogan, “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The “88” stands for “Heil Hitler,” with the H marking the eighth letter of the alphabet.
At another juncture, Dwyer touched on controversy involving release of government files on Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have sought public release of files to either exonerate or incriminate President Donald Trump or other prominent individuals.
“Trumps too busy burning the Epstein files,” Dwyer wrote on Telegram.
Before Politico’s disclosure of the Young Republicans’ commentary, Dwyer and Hendrix were photographed at a campaign event with Senate President Ty Masterson, the Andover Republican who is a 2026 candidate for governor. A social media post of the picture, taken at Masterson’s campaign announcement event, shows both of them holding signs touting Masterson’s campaign for governor.

Politico reports Dwyer and Hendrix took part in a private Telegram chat with other state GOP leaders touting racist, violent and antisemitic ideas such as “I love Hitler” and “They love the watermelon people.” (Submitted)
The Masterson campaign released a statement after the Senate president landed in Washington, D.C., for meetings Wednesday with White House officials. In that statement, Masterson blamed political opponents for “shopping around a photo, with deceitful intentions, in efforts to disparage” him.
“I categorically deny any association with William Hendrix or Alex Dwyer, as neither is current, nor has ever been, on staff or volunteered for my campaign for governor,” Masterson said. “Anyone suggesting otherwise is either lying or misinformed.”
In addition, Masterson said, he was guided by deep Christian faith and possessed a record of condemning hateful and violent rhetoric.
“I am personally disgusted by the comments attributed to individuals in the article, as such behavior is utterly counter to Christ’s message that life is valuable and we are all equal in God’s eyes, and my unwavering commitment to these values has not changed,” the statement said.
A collection of Kansas Republicans and a Democratic candidate for governor denounced contents of this trove of Telegram messages logged under “RESTOREYR WAR ROOM,” or Restore Young Republicans.
The communications chronicled by Politico covered a period between January and August, and involved state Republican leaders in Kansas, Vermont, Arizona and New York. Included in the thousands of comments was this insight: “If we ever had a leak on this chat, we will be cooked.”
“The viewpoints expressed in this chat are not representative of Kansans. Period,” said former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor. “Our state was founded on the belief that all of us are created equal under God — and anyone who mocks those principles dishonors the very spirit of Kansas.”
Vicki Schmidt, the state’s insurance commissioner and a Republican candidate for governor, said Dwyer and Hendrix should formally resign from their Young Republicans positions because “their actions are disgusting and disgraceful and they tarnish the reputation of Kansas nationally.”
Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat also running for governor, said she was disgusted by messages shared by Kansas GOP political operatives that promoted overt racism, extremism, antisemitism and sexual violence. She said the extremist language was encouraged from the top down by politicians who seek to divide voters rather than bring them together.
“Let’s be clear: These aren’t kids joking around,” Holscher said. “These are 20- and 30-something adults with leadership roles in the Republican Party. The chair of the Kansas Young Republicans, who participated in these messages, is nearly 30 years old. Unfortunately, this type of rhetoric is not isolated. For too long in Kansas, the Republican Party has been dominated by extremists who see no room for moderation or bipartisanship, let alone unity or mutual respect.”
Danedri Herbert, chair of the Kansas Republican Party, said the organization’s leadership was disgusted by comments by young Kansas Republicans contained in the Politico story. In March, Herbert was elected state party chair. She is Black.
“Their comments do not reflect the beliefs of Republicans and certainly not of Kansas Republicans at large,” she said. “Republicans believe that all people are created in the image of God.”
She said the state party platform stated: “We welcome Kansans of every ethnicity into our party as we work together to preserve our heritage of political equality, religious freedom and strong moral values. We strive to eliminate racism and we condemn all racist acts and groups.”
Michael Austin, chief executive of the Kansas Black Republican Council, said the organization unequivocally rebuked the behavior and language revealed in Politico’s report.
“Such conduct is not merely offensive. It is a betrayal of the very principles upon which our party was founded: the defense of liberty, the abolition of slavery and the belief in the inherent worth and dignity of every human being,” Austin said. “Let there be no confusion. These few individuals do not represent Kansas, nor do they reflect the values of Kansas Republicans.”
He said all Republicans should in this moment “uphold the standard of integrity, moral courage and respect that has long defined our party’s proud history.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA140850-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 19:57:58.883072

(Photo via Getty Images)An Iowa State University professor’s research, born from tragedies witnessed during Hurricane Katrina, has opened up possibilities as to how the mind captures and stores memories of trauma, especially at a young age.
Carl Weems, an ISU professor of human development and family studies, has published a report detailing a new developmental theory relating to traumatic childhood memories. It states that just because someone’s reporting on a traumatic event might change over time, it doesn’t mean the memories themselves are false.
“I think the model kind of opens up our point of view to really try to dig at it,” Weems said.

Studying tragedy and trauma
Weems has spent his career studying emotional development, traumatic stress and the relationship between the two. He said what brought him to the topic of memory and the supposed liabilities that come with it was a natural disaster he and thousands of other New Orleans residents faced in 2005 — Hurricane Katrina.
The researcher said he spoke with kids more than a year after the hurricane swept through about what they went through and any symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Their responses matched up fairly well with ones given in follow-up interviews six months later. However, when he spoke with those same kids after Hurricane Gustav hit the city in 2008, Weems found that their PTSD symptoms had actually decreased after the second hurricane came through.
“The most surprising thing happened, because I thought the prevailing thing is, if you have multiple bad things happen to you, you get worse, right? But we found that for the sample, their PTSD symptoms went down,” Weems said. “I was dumbfounded for almost a year trying to figure out how to explain this.”

What he found was that participants who had “relatively good” experiences with Gustav reported less negatively about what they went through during Katrina, and those who had a harder time with the second hurricane were more steady in their reports of the first.
Another study was also an influence on his work, Weems said. That research showed that more than 100 out of around 600 people who had experienced “court-identified maltreatment” around the age of 6 did not report having such experiences as adults around the age of 29 when asked.
Bringing together the main ideas from his own and others’ research, Weems said his paper is a “meta review” of these interesting findings that presents a theory of how they could occur.
The continuum of memory
The “prevailing notion” of traumatic memories assumes that if something traumatic happened to someone when they were young, such as sexual abuse, they will either remember it or not. Weems said that is a more black-and-white theory than the one he proposed in his paper.
Weems’s theory maintains that while there can be a simple yes-or-no answer to whether someone has experienced a traumatic event, the memories and perception of that event can exist on a continuum, with multiple factors able to impact it.
How much time has passed since the initial report, other events occurring between the two reports, and how strong the memory was at the time it was first reported can all change how someone perceives their memories of trauma, the report stated. These different factors can lead to some people reporting consistently, others first reporting trauma then later perceiving the event as not traumatic, or reporting trauma then not remembering it at all. Someone could also initially report not having experienced trauma, but report trauma later on.
Weems said he tries to lay out in the paper the possibility of someone recovering a memory after a long time, as the current thought is that if something like sexual abuse happened to someone, “you’re not just going to forget that and then suddenly remember it 20 years later.”
In addition to opening up possibilities for how memory can operate, Weems said there is also an important message in the paper to the professionals who work with traumatized individuals to follow up on the questions they asked when first assessing a client and to not just focus on the symptoms.
“It’s something that evolves over time, and depending on the context, someone might reveal an important — clinically important or therapeutically important — piece of information, depending on when you ask them,” Weems said. “It’s something that if you’re going to ask people about because you’re wanting to help those kinds of people, then you shouldn’t just assess them once.”

He said the Trump administration’s many legal assaults on immigrants have led to widespread fear. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
Over the last few months, Albuquerque-based immigration attorney Mark Moreno has seen the impact of President Donald Trump administration’s immigration crackdown up close: 
Two of his clients deported themselves to Chile after 23 years in America. Two others from Venezuela no longer take their child to school. The rest of his 100 or so clients constantly ask him whether they should continue to show up to immigration appointments or go out in public. 
“Interrupting a child’s education because of all of the increased immigration enforcement —it’s inhumane,” he said during a recent interview at his Albuquerque office.  “It’s a sad thing that we’re seeing, that people are just afraid.”
In the last 10 months, he said, Trump’s mass deportation push has greatly disrupted the course of daily life. For example, seemingly minor federal immigration form changes caused cascading impacts on clients’ cases; the federal Homeland Security agency rendered long-standing protections for young people void; and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are detaining and deporting immigrants after their cases are dismissed.
Immigrant advocates: NM ICE detention ban should have been on special session agenda

All that change represents a paradigm shift, Moreno said, one that underscores the state’s need to take action at the upcoming legislative session.
 Namely, he called on lawmakers to pass laws banning immigrant detention here and requiring local law enforcement to review U Visa applications from immigrants who are victims of or witness to crime. 
The new landscape also coincides with a new name last month for Moreno’s employer, previously known as the Santa Fe Dreamers Project and now doing business as Contigo Immigrant Justice. 
Moreno told Source New Mexico in a recent interview that the name change better reflects the group’s mission, which is no longer confined to Santa Fe or advocacy for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as “Dreamers.”
“I feel like as an organization, we completely outgrew that, because we have clients in Texas, clients in Oklahoma,” he said. “I think the mission has pretty much remained the same: It’s providing care for our immigrant community and just helping them with any form of legal status that they can obtain.”
Changes to laws for younger immigrants have hit particularly hard, he said. Before Trump’s second term, people aged 21 and younger could expect deferred deportation action as a court evaluated their claims of abuse and neglect to receive Special Immigrant Juvenile status.
These days, some of his clients who allege abuse or neglect by one or both parents no longer receive deferred deportation so their cases are being considered at the same time that the federal government is initiating deportation proceedings against them, he said. 
“There’s this misconception that ICE enforcement is basically going after people who have committed crimes,” he said. “People aren’t really seeing that they’re not just targeting people who have committed crimes. They’re going after children as young as, you name it, whatever age, and the impact that it’s having on people, like, we don’t know.”
The federal chaos is all the more reason why the group is pressuring New Mexico state lawmakers to fight back.

The upcoming legislative session
Miles Tokunow, the group’s executive director, told Source, that he is trying to build support for the upcoming 30-day session for bills that could counteract the federal uncertainty.
He said he was disappointed lawmakers didn’t include a ban on immigration detention on the agenda for the special session. He will urge lawmakers come January to pass the bill, which would prohibit counties or other local governments from contracting with ICE to hold detainees here. Three ICE detention centers exist in the state. 
And he said he is organizing support for a bill like  Senate Bill 177 for the upcoming 30-day session 
That bill, sponsored by Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque), would require state law enforcement agencies to act on applications for U Visas, which provide deportation protection to crime victims and witnesses who provide material support to prosecutors. 
Currently, if local law enforcement officials certify through specific forms an immigrant has been helpful to law enforcement or government officials in investigating or prosecuting a crime, the immigrant can receive a U Visa that provides some deportation protections while they help prosecutors. But no state law exists to require local law enforcement to act on those applications, and there is no standardized way they are supposed to evaluate applications, Tokunow said.
Emails provide new details on how NM lawmakers’ ICE lockup visit went off the rails

A bill like SB177 would create a “standard operating procedure for local law enforcement to be able to follow to make sure that survivors of violent crimes, who come to law enforcement agencies for support, that they do get the certifying part of being able to qualify for a U Visa,” Tokunow said. 
The bill only passed a single Senate committee during the legislative session earlier this year. 
Moreno said, as recently as last month, Santa Fe police refused to act on a U Visa application he submitted on a client’s behalf. He sought a meeting with officials and never heard back, he said, until a week later:
“I got a letter in the mail from the police department, basically saying, ‘Hey, we saw this. We’re not signing. Have a great day,’ he said. “And that’s basically all that we can do at this moment, because it’s discretionary as to whether they sign or not.”
Santa Fe Police Chief Paul Joye did not respond to Source’s request for more information Tuesday about the case. Moreno declined to say much about it, too, on behalf of his client, though he did say the client was a crime victim and that he attached a police report that should have made the case cut and dry. 
Tokunow said cases like Moreno’s client show why standards are needed across New Mexico. 
“I know that public safety is a really big issue right now, and this is really one of the ways that we can support an agenda towards a safer community,” he said. “If there’s a large swath of folks who feel like they can’t go to law enforcement, that’s a big problem, right?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1000-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 18:57:31.436809

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana has launched an online portal for businesses that generate waste tires and collect fees for the state to recycle them.
Auto dealers, tire shops and others who sell cars or tires can now submit their monthly reports and fee payments through a secure digital portal on the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality website, according to a news release the agency released Tuesday.
Whenever someone buys new tires or a new vehicle with tires, a charge is added in the form of a waste tire cleanup and recycling fee. The fee ranges from $2.25 per tire for standard sized wheels on passenger vehicles and pickup trucks, $5 for medium truck tires and $10 for off-road tires.  All tire dealers and new car dealers in Louisiana are required by law to collect the fees from their customers at the point of sale and then forward them to the state Treasury at the end of every month. 
Using the portal carries its own convenience fee of $2.50 per payment, and credit card transactions carry an additional 2.5% fee. 
LDEQ officials said the portal saw strong participation in September, its first full month in use. Of 2,060 notices successfully sent to waste tire generators, 483 users submitted their reports through the portal, the agency said.
“The response from users in the first month has been extremely positive,” LDEQ Undersecretary Theresa Delafosse said in the release. “This system is secure, efficient and user-friendly — exactly the kind of innovation that helps both our stakeholders and our staff work smarter.” 
For fiscal year 2024-25, the state collected $13.3 million in waste tire fees. The state uses the money to recycle used tires, an effort that poses technological and environmental challenges because of the complex designs of modern tires with layers of rubber, plastic, fabric and metal. Shredding tires releases chemicals and microplastics that are harmful to the environment and pose health risks to humans, according to LDEQ. Additionally, the presence of steel belts in tires complicates the recycling process, requiring specialized equipment to separate the layers. 
Earlier this year, LDEQ began offering $20,000 grants to local governments to help with tire recycling and tackling the widespread problem of illegal tire dumping. In September, the pilot program awarded the grants to six local governments: the parishes of Iberville, Lafourche, Ouachita and Terrebonne and the cities of Gretna and West Monroe.

The judge overseeing that case scheduled a Wednesday hearing to listen to arguments before deciding whether to grant a temporary restraining order. Back pay in questionThe Trump administration has made several moves during the shutdown that are not typically taken during prolonged funding lapses.Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought have indicated they may not provide back pay to furloughed federal workers after the shutdown ends, which is required by a 2019 law. And they have sought to cancel funding approved by Congress for projects in sections of the country that vote for Democrats. The Pentagon is also reprogramming money to provide pay for active duty military members this week, despite Congress not taking action on that issue.The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the size of government during the shutdown are widely seen as an effort to pressure Democrats to vote for the stopgap spending bill, but they haven’t had any measurable effect so far. Another failed Senate voteThe Senate deadlocked for an eighth time Tuesday evening on the House-passed funding bill that would last through Nov. 21.

Those federal employees work at the departments of Education and Interior, as well as the National Science Foundation. “This will be the last paycheck that these federal workers receive until Democrats grow a spine and reopen the federal government,” she said. Last week, 700,000 civilian federal workers received about 70% of their usual paycheck, due to the shutdown. Those employees work for the Executive Office of the President, Health and Human Services, Department of Veterans Affairs, civilians at the Defense Department, NASA, General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management, among others.Active duty military members were set to miss their first paycheck Wednesday until the Pentagon shifted $8 billion in research funds to pay the troops on time. U.S. Capitol Police Labor Committee Chairman Gus Papathanasiou released a statement Tuesday that the thousands of officers who protect members of Congress missed a full paycheck Friday. “The longer the shutdown drags on, the harder it becomes for my officers,” Papathanasiou wrote. “Banks and landlords do not give my officers a pass because we are in a shutdown — they still expect to be paid. “Unfortunately, Congress and the Administration are not in active negotiations, and everyone is waiting for the other side to blink.

(Courtesy of Cathy Brechtelsbauer)Protesters put 4,321 paper dolls on display Tuesday at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre, representing the number of children affected by the state’s funding reduction for a program benefiting low-income families.
Beth Davis, one of 264 people who helped decorate the paper dolls, put herself through college in the 1980s as a young, single mother raising her daughter with the help of Aid for Dependent Children, a precursor to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. She completed her degree and led a statewide nonprofit, Dakota Resources, for years.
“I was a good investment, and most of the women who are taking care of these kids and doing the best they can are a good investment,” Davis said.
The Department of Social Services reduced TANF benefits by 10% during the summer, affecting families’ September benefits and beyond. Recipients were expected to lose anywhere from $32 to $136 a month in benefits, depending on the size of their family. The average household was expected to lose $51 a month. The department has not yet released a monthly TANF data report since the benefit reduction took effect.
The state will save about $1.5 million annually. It distributed $15.3 million in TANF benefits last fiscal year.

The move is part of a larger plan to gradually reduce benefits each year to the minimum state contribution needed to receive federal funding. That’s about a 35% reduction, or $180 less per month for the average household, according to department officials. The average household’s monthly benefit payment last year was $518.06.
TANF is a federal-state program most commonly used to provide financial assistance to low-income families with children, on the condition that the caregiver searches or trains for a job. 
The protest group got permission from the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration to place the paper doll display around part of the Capitol building. Some paper dolls were decorated with Halloween costumes — like tigers or mummies — while others wore NFL team shirts, colored by children and adults.
Organizer Cathy Brechtelsbauer wants lawmakers to reinstate the funding and set a cost of living adjustment going forward. The display caught the attention of out-of-state visitors to the building, but Brechtelsbauer said she doesn’t know if it caught Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s attention. 
“We’re hoping the governor’s response will be, ‘That shouldn’t have happened. I’ll make sure these kids get the assistance for their basic needs they deserve and need,’” Brechtelsbauer said.
Rhoden was at a rural health care conference Tuesday in Sioux Falls. He told the media that the cuts are “sacrifices” caused in part by federal cuts to address the country’s “deficit problem.”
“We’re being as vigilant as we can at making these cuts, as appropriate as possible, and we’re always open to input as far as how we can do better,” Rhoden said. “But this is the hand we’re dealt and we’re doing the best we can to make sure that we’re acting in the most appropriate way, making the most appropriate cuts.”

While some federal funding for the state is being reduced, Sioux Falls Democratic Rep. Erik Muckey said the TANF cuts made by Rhoden’s administration “had nothing to do with the feds.” The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made cuts to programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, did not impact TANF.
“The decision made by the Department of Social Services went against the will of the Legislature with what we budgeted,” Muckey said.
Muckey tried unsuccessfully to persuade lawmakers on the legislative Rules Review Committee to reject the cuts. Muckey said he and other legislators on the budget committee believed a $5.3 million state funding cut would be replaced with unspent TANF funds from previous years. 
Davis, who helped color the paper dolls but wasn’t able to attend the event on Tuesday, said that although there might be cuts to address state budget needs — due to federal changes or tight revenues — the state should find that money in other places rather than taking it away from low-income families.
“If the state Legislature can’t figure out another place, then we’re in deep trouble,” Davis said. “We don’t balance a budget on the backs of poor women and children.”
The display was up for Tuesday only, but Brechtelsbauer said a few paper dolls were left at the Capitol for Rhoden.

It’s the third hire with ties to Balint that Pieciak has made since the start of the last election cycle — and comes as he is widely rumored to be mulling a run for governor.
David Scherr, who has served as Balint’s state director, will take a new job as deputy state treasurer on Nov. 3, according to a press release from Pieciak’s office. Gavin Boyles, the previous deputy treasurer, has already stepped down from the role.
Scherr has served as Balint’s state director since Balint first won office in 2022. In the role, he leads the congressional office’s outreach and constituent services. Before that, he served as general counsel for the state Cannabis Control Board and worked in the Vermont Attorney General’s Office. He also ran twice, unsuccessfully, for state Senate.
The other former Balint staffers have been with Pieciak since at least last year. 
Peter Trombley, who worked on Balint’s 2022 campaign and in her office in 2023, later ran Pieciak’s 2024 campaign and is now a “special advisor” to the treasurer.
Meanwhile, Pieciak has been working with Natalie Silver — one of the state’s best known Democratic strategists and Balint’s 2022 campaign manager — since 2023, he said in an interview Tuesday. Silver took on a more formal role as Pieciak’s political adviser, overseeing his campaign work, following his 2024 win, the treasurer said. 
Pieciak said Scherr’s hiring was not related to his future plans for office. He declined to say Tuesday whether he would seek the treasurer’s job, or a different office, in 2026.
“He’s just a really strong leader, really strong strategic advisor. I think he is the person that can best serve our office,” the treasurer said, adding that by hiring Scherr, he is “just focused on, how do we build a good team and serve Vermonters the best?”
“Right now, that’s my focus — on the treasurer’s office and the work that we’re doing as an elected leader to stand up against this administration,” Pieciak said, referring to President Donald Trump.
Republican Gov. Phil Scott has not said publicly, either, whether he will seek another term in office in 2026. Scott has made a habit in years past of not announcing his reelection plans until the state Legislature adjourns for the summer — typically in May — during an election year, so any such announcement is likely months away.
At the same time, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark said in August that she plans to run in next year’s election, though has “not officially decided what office I’m running for.” She declined to say at the time which offices she was considering. 
Vermont’s other statewide Democratic leaders — Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas and Auditor Doug Hoffer — have said they aren’t seeking higher office next year, as has Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who plans to run for his post again.
Both Pieciak and Clark are sitting on substantial campaign cash, according to their latest filings with the state, which detail fundraising and spending through the end of June. Pieciak had about $184,000 on hand, the filings show, while Clark had about $98,000. Copeland Hanzas, by comparison, had about $12,000 on hand as of late June.
As attorney general, Clark has filed more than two dozen lawsuits, together with other states, against the Trump administration since the start of his second term. She has perhaps a more natural avenue, in the courts, to push back against many of Trump’s actions — but Pieciak, for his part, has made public pushes against Trump, too. The president remains deeply unpopular in Vermont, with 72% of respondents to a University of New Hampshire poll in August saying they disapprove of his handling of the job. 
Earlier this month, Pieciak joined his counterparts in five other states challenging the inclusion of Trump’s media company in a major stock index. He also pointed Tuesday to how, earlier this year, he helped start a legal defense fund — outside of his official capacity — for noncitizen Vermonters targeted for removal proceedings by federal immigration authorities.Meanwhile, the treasurer has also taken aim at Trump in recent campaign fundraising emails, branded with “Mike Pieciak” and “Treasurer” at the top. Last month, for instance, he used one message to decry the pressure the Trump administration put on ABC to temporarily kick the late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel off the airwaves. 
Since January, Gov. Scott has, broadly, urged state leaders to be less confrontational in what he’s said is an effort to protect Vermont’s existing federal funding and benefits. While Scott has rejected two requests from the White House to deploy Vermont’s national guard, he also faced sharp criticism — including from Pieciak — over a decision to share sensitive data with the Trump administration on thousands of people who receive federal nutritional benefits.
Pieciak seemed to take aim at the idea of a cautious approach in a campaign email last week, comparing leaders who have “given in” to pressure from Trump to those who haven’t. 
“People like Minnesota Governor Tim Walz — and even Vermont’s own, Senator Bernie Sanders — have modeled the kind of resistance we need in this moment. And what has happened to them? Nothing,” Pieciak wrote. “It’s clear: The only response right now to this administration is to fight back tooth and nail at every opportunity. There’s no other choice.”
“That’s the exact kind of leadership we need in Vermont right now,” he added. “If you’re with me, will you pitch in any amount to fuel my work?”

The latest victim is Cayus Stevens, who died as a result of wounds he suffered in Heidelberg, the third fatality from that shooting. Friends and community members on social media identified him as a graduate from the Heidelberg High School Class of 2018. 
A Friday shooting in the Delta city of Leland claimed the lives of six people in what is the deadliest mass shooting in the country this year. Shootings were also reported after a South Delta High School football game in Anguilla in Sharkey County on Friday and at two university homecomings on Saturday, resulting in one death at Alcorn State University. 
“This kind of senseless violence has no place in Heidelberg or anywhere in Mississippi,” Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said in a statement.
The other victims killed in the Heidelberg shooting were another graduate, Mikea McCray, 28, of Laurel, and Chris Newell, 35, of Laurel.
White extended his condolences to the families of the victims and asked the public to keep them in their thoughts and prayers. He also thanked a coordinated response and assistance from local and state law enforcement. 
Four have been arrested and charged in the Heidelberg shooting.
Tylar Goodloe, 18, is charged with two counts of capital murder and possession of a weapon on educational property. A judge set his bond at $2 million cash.  
The others arrested are Damarin Starks, 19, charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with physical evidence; Jadarius Quartez Page, 19, charged with accessory after the fact; and Jabari Deshaun Collins, 19, charged with possession of a deadly weapon on educational property.
White said the investigation continues and the police department will do everything in its power to receive justice for the victims and their families. 
This week, the FBI Jackson office announced five people are in custody and charged in the Leland shooting: Morgan Lattimore, 25, capital murder; Teviyon L. Powell, 29, capital murder; William Bryant, 29, capital murder; Terrogernal S. Martin, 33, capital murder; and Latoya A. Powell, 44, attempted murder. 
It was not immediately clear if those arrested have attorneys. An FBI spokesperson said additional arrests are pending. 
The suspects arrested Monday had first appearance hearings in Washington County, the justice court clerk’s office confirmed, but bond information was not immediately available. 
Martin’s bond was set at $1 million cash, the FBI confirmed, but a spokesperson did not immediately confirm in which court they appeared. 
The Washington County coroner identified the Leland victims as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr., 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34.
Less than an hour away, another shooting happened Friday night outside a football game in Anguilla. In a statement, Sharkey County Sheriff Herbert Ceaser said one person was shot and taken to a local hospital. 
Ceaser said two people have been arrested in the shooting but did not identify them. The sheriff said violence will not be tolerated. 
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim’s family during this incredibly difficult time,” Ceasar said in the statement. “We ask the community to come together in support and remain positive as the investigation continues.”
Brekyra Fisher, 29, of Vicksburg, died at Alcorn State. The university said Fisher was not a student.

(Photo courtesy Micah 6:8 Mission)SULPHUR – When Cindy Robertson bought her home in the Portie Town neighborhood, the first thing she did was put a box out front and stock it with free food for those in need. The box was the genesis of her organization Micah 6:8 Mission, a reference to a scriptural exhortation to “serve justice, love mercy, walk humbly.”
After Hurricane Laura, her mission expanded.
“We all talk about, ‘it was before the storm.’ We know what storm we’re talking about. It was for Southwest Louisiana what Katrina was for New Orleans. Fifty percent of our buildings or homes were either lost or damaged,” she explains. A blue tarp is still on her neighbor’s roof.
Robertson began working for the Episcopal Diocese of Western Louisiana as a disaster coordinator, which is how she connected to the newly formed Disaster Justice Network. DJN is a volunteer network formed in response to the overwhelming need for recovery after the string of storms that walloped Southwest Louisiana in 2020 and 2021, including Hurricane Laura.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It began with grassroots weekly meetings of disaster response specialists, community organizers, faith leaders, researchers and academics working on recovery as a way to share resources and maximize impact.
They set up community water testing, air quality testing and small-house alternative housing, all after Laura.
“People who are in academia are beginning to realize that there’s a wealth of knowledge that is available from community organizers and community organizations and community members. We have knowledge, you know. We may be poor, but we’re not ignorant,” she says.
Her own ministry grew to include environmental justice, and used resources from the Disaster Justice Network to increase disaster recovery aid in the area.
She also began connecting to communities outside of metropolitan Lake Charles.
That’s how she met the Rev. James Harris of Evergreen Baptist Church in DeQuincy. Together, they set up a tool library, shared DJN pamphlets on technical disaster preparedness (think, taping roof seams, resilient rebuilding and mold removal), and connected the dots between his congregation’s resources and those in need in the area.
Working from the ground up, she found disaster victims who fell through the cracks of the federal disaster response system, often getting less aid.
For instance, many residents lack clear title to their inherited family homes. Without that documentation, they can’t qualify for FEMA aid. Roberston connected one such woman, who lived near Harris’ church in DeQuincy, with the minister’s team, who put on a new, more resilient roof — a repair she couldn’t otherwise afford.
“There are so many people in our communities that fall just below the income limits or don’t have this one piece of paper,” says Robertson. “Every time we have a climate disaster the least of the least have less and less. And that shouldn’t be. We should step up as church, as community, and help the least of the least.”
Roberston points to how incredibly well positioned churches are to lead us through the environmental challenges of our area.
“Churches should be a place where people can come after a disaster. Every church should have a solar panel set up on its roofs so they can provide comfort, light, cooling, or heat,” she says. “Every denomination has a mission fund. There’s mission work right in your own backyard.”
Robertson’s food box is now surrounded by a garden for neighbors to harvest from. She also hosts regular meetings for community members and teens, so her community can withstand and recover from future environmental and economic challenges.
“And there’s still disaster work that needs to be done,” she says, looking at the blue tarp across the street.

Gov. Phil Scott called for state Sen. Sam Douglass to resign on Tuesday after reporting by Politico revealed remarks he made in a leaked national Young Republicans group chat. Scott, a Republican, said the comments in the group chat  — which reportedly included derogatory language and slurs — were “disgusting and unacceptable.”
Republican leaders of both chambers of the Vermont Legislature also swiftly echoed Scott’s statement, calling the comments “unacceptable and deeply disturbing.” The statement signed by Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, and House Minority Leader Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney, and the two assistant leaders, Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, and Rep. Casey Toof, R-St. Albans Town, concluded saying, “It is time for Sen. Douglass to step away from his position as a Vermont Senator and resign.”
In a June exchange between former New York State Young Republicans co-chair Bobby Walker and chair Peter Giunta, Walker mentioned a mutual friend who had dated an “obese Indian woman,” according to the report. Giunta replied that the woman was not Indian, to which Douglass responded: “She just didn’t bathe often.”
After Douglass made a comment about a Jewish colleague potentially making a procedural mistake, his wife and national Young Republicans committee member Brianna Douglass responded, stating, “you’re giving nationals to (sic) much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”
Samuel and Brianna Douglass did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Following the release of the chats, Vermont political leaders on both sides of the aisle have swiftly moved to denounce Douglass’ remarks and call for his resignation.
“The vile, racist, bigoted, and antisemitic dialogue that has been reported is deeply disturbing,” Scott wrote in a Tuesday statement. “Those involved should resign from their roles immediately and leave the Republican party — including Vermont State Senator Sam Douglass.”

The Republican legislative leaders also wrote that the remarks reported by Politico “cannot be excused and are inconsistent with Vermont values and what Vermont Republicans stand for.”
Lt. Gov. John Rodgers said Tuesday that the reported language used by Douglass and other Young Republicans members was disturbing, and “would lead any decent person to either call them out or at least leave the chat.” Rodgers said Douglass’ resignation would be a good start to address the situation.
“It is unfortunate that national politics seems to have normalized this type of aggressive discourse,” Rodgers said. “It’s not OK — coming from either party, coming from any person — and we need to figure out how to get past it and get back to dialogue.”
Democrats and advocates add their voices
Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, echoed the call for Douglass to resign in a statement. Baruth wrote that the reported racist and antisemitic comments from Samuel Douglass and Young Republicans group leaders is reflective of the “ugliness and the hateful bigotry of Trumpism.”
“It’s also critical to note that a single resignation will not eliminate the disturbing rhetoric permeating this country,” Baruth wrote. “The Vermont GOP must address and reject the largely covert network of hatred that binds them to racist and white nationalist elements nationwide.”
Hudson Ranney, communications director for the Vermont Young Democrats, said the group would also like to see Douglass to step down and apologize for the “deeply offensive and prejudiced comments, including derogatory stereotypes about Indigenous women and antisemitic remarks about his Jewish colleagues.”
Ranney wrote that every citizen deserves respect from their representatives, which Douglass failed to uphold. 
“Baseless hatred is not a problem for others to deal with. As this incident shows, bigotry is inside our own house. It is a stain that we all must confront,” Ranney wrote.
The Vermont Young Republicans Vice Chair and Deputy Vice Chair did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, wrote in a statement Tuesday that Douglass owes an explanation and more to his constituents and questioned whether Douglass could be trusted to serve in public office. 
“To know that an elected official from Vermont took part in this long-running chat that included the repeated use of incredibly violent, racist, and antisemitic rhetoric is sickening,” Burns wrote.
Mia Schultz, a commissioner of the Vermont Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Rutland Area NAACP president, said the state needs leaders not to perpetuate prejudice but instead display integrity, empathy and accountability, even in close circles. 
“It’s a moment to remember that racism and antisemitism are not relics of the past,” Schultz said. “They’re living in our reality right now, and they appear in whispers and jokes and these digital faces as we find time and time again. And the harm is real, and it’s the responsibility of all of us to confront it, that includes the people in power.”

It's a rare event in California history in part because sheriffs are elected officials.,"In summary
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted to remove Sheriff Christina Corpus after allegations of nepotism in her office. It’s a rare event in California history in part because sheriffs are elected officials.


For the first time in California history, a county sheriff has been removed from office. 
The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to remove Sheriff Christina Corpus from office today, nearly a year after a damning report from a retired county judge found that she likely violated the county’s policy on nepotism and conflicting relationships. 
Removing her wasn’t as simple as firing someone. It took a successful San Mateo County ballot measure that asked voters to choose whether to amend the county charter to grant the board that power.
“Today is the end of a tragic, destructive and grossly expensive chapter in San Mateo County history,” said Supervisor Jackie Speier, a former member of Congress. “I had high hopes for Sheriff Corpus. I voted for her, I held a town hall with her on crime prevention. She had great ideas to modernize the office. 
“So it’s tragic to see her time as sheriff come down to this.”
Corpus still has 14 days to appeal her removal. San Mateo County Attorney John Nibbelin said the county’s undersheriff will serve as sheriff. 
Corpus, appearing in a blue suit at the board meeting, argued adamantly against her removal. She said she was elected as a reformer, and the changes she tried to push through the sheriff’s office were met with first resistance, then outright hostility, when the old guard in power in San Mateo County began working to undermine her.  
“I have sacrificed my peace, my marriage, for this job,” Corpus said. “If I lose my position today, I will walk out with my head held very high. I never bowed to intimidation. 
“You may remove me from office but you will not erase the truth.” 
Corpus’ legal team, which now includes a one-time member of President Barack Obama’s cabinet, made a half-hour presentation arguing against the legality of her removal. 
“Culture change is hard,” said Tom Perez, who was labor secretary under Obama and former chair of the Democratic National Committee. “From Day One, there were folks who didn’t want her to succeed.” 
The county of San Mateo, one of the wealthiest in the country, has been paying Corpus’ legal bills. If she is removed in two weeks, she will be responsible for her legal costs from that point. 
Last week, retired Superior Court Judge James Emerson found cause to remove Corpus after a two-week trial that included a cascade of allegations portraying a chaotic picture of her two-plus years in office. 
Emerson found that Corpus had “a close personal relationship outside the boundaries of a professional working relationship” with a subordinate, unlawfully ordered the arrest of the president of the sheriff’s deputies’ union and retaliated against a captain who refused to conduct the union president’s arrest because he believed it violated state law.
If Corpus is not removed, she will return to a unique six-year term afforded to elected members of law enforcement in 2022 when the state moved county sheriff and district attorney races to the presidential election year calendar. 
About 25 people spoke during the board’s public comment period. Some came to praise Corpus, others to bury her, none more so than the daughter of the sheriff’s deputies’ union president, whom Corpus ordered arrested last year – something Judge Emerson found was retaliatory. 
The sheriff’s office alleged that the union president, Carlos Tapia, was doing union business on company time and falsified the record of his working hours. But an investigation by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office found no reason to charge Tapia, determining that the errors on his time cards were clerical and concluding that Tapia “should not have been arrested.
A captain in the sheriff’s office resigned rather than arrest Tapia, and Tapia alleged in a lawsuit filed against the county that Corpus demanded his arrest as retaliation against him for complaining about her leadership.  
Vanessa Lemus-Tapia, Tapia’s daughter, said at the meeting that Corpus was incorrectly claiming credit for reducing crime in San Mateo County when the rate for most major crimes statewide has fallen. 
“That was not her doing,” Lemus-Tapia said, before addressing Corpus directly. “Stop fighting this. Restore trust, dignity and integrity to this department.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/012323-Christina-Corpus-San-Mateo-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 18:57:31.436809

(Photo by Alex Edelman/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Hate crime ordinances in municipalities across South Carolina would likely be struck down as overstepping their legal authority, according to an analysis by the state attorney general’s office, which on Tuesday appeared unlikely to affect lawmakers’ debate over a state crime.
The nonbinding legal opinion concludes the ordinances may violate both the state constitution’s ban on local governments creating criminal law and — depending on what they criminalize — the U.S. Constitution’s free speech rights under the First Amendment.
“The use of hatred to intimidate others is repulsive and has no place in society,” Solicitor General Robert Cook wrote, stressing he doesn’t want to undermine local governments’ ability to “condemn racial, religious, or other forms of hatred. We condemn these as well and fully support Home Rule.”
However, he continued, “criminal hate crime ordinances have been rendered ‘off limits’ by our State Constitution and this form of criminal behavior may be addressed only by the General Assembly.”
Regardless, he notes, the existing local rules remain fully in place “unless and until a court decides otherwise.”
The opinion, dated Oct. 10, was sought by Greenwood’s city attorney, after a resident called on City Council during a public meeting in June to pass its own ordinance. Attorney James Padgett’s concerns were largely confirmed in the opinion.
“Whether we can do something or not, this is really an issue that needs to be taken up by our Legislature,” Mayor Brandon Smith, a former state Municipal Association board member, told the SC Daily Gazette.
South Carolina is among just two states without a specific hate crime law. (Wyoming is the other.)
As attempts to pass a law repeatedly failed in the Legislature, two dozen towns and cities, as well as two counties, have passed local rules making it unlawful to intimidate someone because of who they are, to include their race, religion, gender identity or disability. Penalties vary. Possibilities include community service, participation in an anti-bigotry education program, a $500 fine, and up to 30 days in jail.
Such a “patchwork” statewide is what the state constitution sought to avoid, Cook wrote.
House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford disagreed with that analysis.
“He’s saying cities and counties can’t come up with their own crimes because they can’t exceed state law. Well, there’s no state law on it,” said the Columbia Democrat.
Both the capital city and surrounding Richland County have passed hate crime ordinances. Rutherford, an attorney, said local governments could respond to a legal challenge by simply removing the criminal penalty.
“Cities should look to address as much as possible hate in South Carolina and take a stand,” he told the SC Daily Gazette. “It needs to be punished when people act on their hate.”
Violence motivated by hate is unfortunately becoming increasingly common, he said, and government should step in to tell people that won’t be tolerated.
“We can’t allow that because when people feel they can do that, that’s when society goes off the rails,” Rutherford said.
His caucus will push again for legislation next year, he said, while acknowledging approval hinges on the Senate.
Since 2021, the House has twice passed legislation that would add penalties for people convicted of committing a crime due to their victim’s race, gender or sexual orientation. But those proposals never got a vote on the Senate floor, with GOP opponents saying proving hate involves prosecuting thoughts, and violent crimes already carry stiff penalties.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said Tuesday he agrees that only the Legislature can set criminal law. He also agrees there’s been an alarming increase in violence fueled by anger and hatred. But he still opposes creating a state hate crime.
The answer, he said, should be criminal laws that punish severely regardless of the victim’s identity.
“It shouldn’t depend on what city you live in. If the law’s insufficient, let’s address the law,” said the Edgefield Republican. “I think it’s culturally destructive policy to enshrine in the law that some people are more important than others, and we’re going to treat people differently.”
He’s not budged by criticism that South Carolina is nearly alone in its lack of a hate crime, he said, noting the existence of a hate crime in other states clearly isn’t dissuading violent, hate-fueled crime.
“Look at how well they’ve worked,” he said about other states’ laws. “It hasn’t done anything to protect those victims that it’s designed to protect.”
He contends the punishment for violent crime is often already more severe in South Carolina than in Democrat-led states with a hate crime statute. In cases of murder, punishment can include life without the possibility of parole or death: “We don’t need a hate crime to get you there,” he said of death row.
Senate rules allow a single senator to block legislation, at least temporarily. While opposed to hate crime bills, Massey has not been among GOP senators to officially object to them and block debate. An objection can be overridden by a vote that puts a bill on special debate status. But so far, hate crime proposals have lacked majority support among the Senate’s dominating Republicans for Massey to call for a public vote.
Sen. Tom Davis, who supports hate crime legislation, said he’ll try again next year to persuade his GOP colleagues. He points to the state’s death penalty statute in hopes of changing their mind.
In South Carolina, killers can be sentenced to death only after they’re convicted of murder, and the crime must involve at least one factor on a list of “aggravating circumstances,” such as happening during a burglary or kidnapping, or the victim being a child.
Davis, R-Beaufort, likens that list to the enhanced penalties allowed by a hate crime law.
The bill last passed by the House in 2023 would have added up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine to the sentence of a hate-motivated violent crime.
“We’re not talking about making thoughts a crime or speech a crime or making a new felony,” he told the Gazette. “Certain crimes are more heinous than others, and we already recognize that.”
While he understands local officials’ frustration in passing their own hate crime ordinances, Davis said he nonetheless agrees with the attorney general’s opinion.
“I think it’s a matter that needs some debate,” Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters at the Statehouse on Tuesday.
His concern is that passing a hate crime law would give law enforcement the power to conduct expansive searches of people’s homes and possessions to prove their motivation came from a place of hate, he said.
“We have so many laws now that cover A to Z, with penalties that can be very severe,” McMaster said. “The judges and magistrates, I believe, are the answer. If they use those laws that we already have and implement them fully and carefully, then that would be the way to keep the lid on things.”
The governor stopped short of saying existing local ordinances should be challenged in court. If someone wants a ruling to throw them out, they’re welcome to try, he said.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Environmental groups penned a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency urging the federal agency to maintain its previously rescinded ruling that seven segments of Iowa rivers were impaired due to nitrate concentrations. 
The environmental groups said EPA’s decision to delist these segments was “inconsistent” with the law, failed to hold polluters accountable and would lead to increased regulatory costs for water treatment in Iowa. 
The decision from EPA followed a summer with near-record high nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers near Des Moines and the first-ever lawn watering ban from Central Iowa Water Works on account of the high nitrate concentrations, coupled with summer water demand. 
Dani Replogle, staff attorney for the environmental group Food & Water Watch, called the EPA decision “baseless” and said it “does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health.” 
“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination,” Replogle said in a statement. “Iowans need more clean water protections — not less.”

Background 
EPA ruled in January that the Iowa Department of Natural Resources needed to add seven river segments to its 2024 list of impaired water segments. This decision, which EPA said was due to the high levels of nitrate and “nitrate plus nitrite,” another form of combined nitrogen similar to nitrate, in the segments, was rescinded by EPA in July.
EPA said in their letter changing the decision that it is seeking additional information from DNR to determine “whether  ‘good cause’ exists to not include the seven referenced waters.”
The original decision was opposed by DNR, with DNR’s executive director Kayla Lyon arguing the agency was holding Iowa’s department to “a very high standard.” DNR argued the designation would yield higher costs and greater regulatory oversight associated with the designation. 
The impaired segments, on the Cedar, Des Moines, Raccoon, Iowa and South Skunk rivers, serve as drinking water sources for several municipalities including Des Moines, Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. 
EPA holds that concentrations of nitrate and nitrite above 10 milligrams per liter in drinking water can lead to shortness of breath, blue-baby syndrome or even death in infants under the age of 6 months. Other research indicates long-term exposure to nitrate in drinking water is linked to certain types of cancer. 
According to the EPA’s letter from July, announcing the recission of the impaired water segments, DNR did not list the segments in its impaired list because it applied standards for nitrate that “solely protect against chronic effects” while EPA applied standards that apply to both chronic and acute effects of nitrate. 
Per EPA’s letter, this information was made clear in May 2025 when DNR submitted additional information to EPA explaining why the segments do not need an impairment listing. 
Iowa Environmental Council, Environmental Law & Policy Center and Food & Water Watch, the groups that penned the letter to EPA, also obtained records, via a public information request, on communications between DNR and EPA. Per the records request, the documents submitted were DNR’s 2001 water quality standards document and EPA’s subsequent approval of the standards. 
The groups allege these documents, being more than 20 years old, were already submitted to EPA. The environmental groups allege any additional information, including explanation from DNR, occurred in an “undocumented oral conversation” which was referenced in an obtained email. 
The environmental groups, in their letter, argue these actions were “outside the process contemplated” in the Clean Water Act, which allows for a change to impaired water lists when EPA requests additional documents, and for public comment. 
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for Iowa Environmental Council said the decision “lacks transparency” and was “based on outdated” information. 
“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” Schmidt said in a statement.
An EPA spokesperson said in a statement that DNR’s impaired waters list for 2024 made use of data from 2020-2022.
“IDNR is in the process of compiling and assessing water quality data from 2022-2024 and is expected to public notice its draft 2026 list early next year, which will include an assessment of these same seven water segments,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Concurrently, EPA will be working with IDNR to understand and resolve the issues forming the basis for EPA’s reconsideration of its 2024 decision.”
The spokesperson said it is working with DNR in the “spirit of cooperative federalism” and using “the latest information” to ensure water quality standards are “followed and upheld.”
“EPA has been tracking the levels of nitrate and is ensuring that all of the information and data collected by the cities, universities, and other groups is provided to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) for evaluation,” the spokesperson said.
Acute vs chronic
DNR argued its application of nitrate parameters pertained to chronic effects, which is why the department chose not to list the seven segments. The environmental groups argued the nitrate standard used does not apply solely to chronic effects. 
The letter from environmental groups argued a symptom like blue-baby syndrome is an acute, rather than chronic, health outcome and is prevented by the EPA via the maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs, adopted under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The letter alleges the cited 2001 water quality standards from DNR incorporated these MCLs “as the water quality standard.” 
A spokesperson for DNR declined to comment on the environmental groups’ letter and their position against the department’s reasoning.
In public comments to EPA’s original action, DNR director Lyon said the federal agency’s decision was incorrect because nitrate is not a “toxic pollutant.” The letter countered this argument by saying EPA’s toxic pollutant list outdated. 
The letter said “overlooking the acute consequences” of high nitrate is inconsistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Environmental groups also cited Iowa Code for water quality standards and argued the “narrative” standards for surface water prohibit “toxic pollutants in toxic amounts.” 
The referenced state standards note that substances toxic to humans, or “detrimental to treatment process” must have limited concentrations in surface water. 
Water treatment facilities are responsible for keeping contaminants, like nitrate, within legal limits for drinking water. In Des Moines, where the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers were both elevated above 10 mg/L for nearly 70 days this summer, water treatment facilities were forced to run costly nitrate removal systems for more than 110 days this summer. 
Environmental groups via the letter, said removing the segments from the impaired list “fails to address the causes” of pollution and “unfairly burdens” water treatment facilities. 
Leadership from Des Moines Water Works echoed this sentiment following EPA’s delisting decision. They said in a news release that the decision did not align with financial and operational realities the utility faced in providing clean drinking water to the city. 
Once a water segment is listed as impaired, EPA and DNR develop water quality improvement plans, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load or TMDLs, that require reductions to the known pollutant. 
“Drinking water issues across the state, from western Iowa to the waters removed from the list by EPA, demonstrate the necessity for further action to address pollution in drinking water sources,” the letter said. 
Iowa Environmental Council Water Program Director Colleen Fowle said EPA’s decision holds that the waterways in question meet safe drinking water standards, which she said is an “unjustified and dangerous” claim. 
“Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense,” Fowle said in the statement. “EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.” 
The environmental groups called for EPA to restore the impaired waters designation and consider their stated concerns as the agency reevaluates Iowa’s impaired waters list.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in The Valley News on Oct. 14, 2025.
BRADFORD — A recent string of gasoline thefts have hit residents and businesses in the Upper Valley.
In mid-September, employees at Route 5 Auto in Bradford discovered holes drilled into the plastic gas tanks of four vehicles and their fuel stolen, owner Mike Gherardi said.
When employees arrived at the shop on Lower Plain the morning of Sept. 15, “we could smell gas,” Gherardi said. At first, an employee suspected the fumes were coming from a Chevrolet El Camino that he was working on.
“After I was outside for a while, I was like, ‘It’s way too pungent’,” Gherardi recounted. He started crawling under vehicles parked in the lot and “saw the holes drilled in the gas tanks.” Three of the vehicles that were targeted were pickup trucks and one was a car.

“Luckily some of the vehicles were old enough that I didn’t have to replace the tank, I was able to repair them,” Gherardi said. If he had to replace them entirely, the cost could rise to a couple thousand dollars, he added.
Gherardi contacted the Bradford Police Department, which is investigating the incident, according to a police news release issued Sept. 18. Police Chief Russell Robinson could not be reached by deadline.
Gherardi’s business wasn’t the only one hit.
Wells River Chevrolet, located on Railroad Street, also had gas stolen from vehicles parked on its lot in September.
The Hartford Police Department had one report of possible gasoline theft within the last month at the Wilder Park and Ride, Lt. William Furnari said.
On Oct. 6, a Topsham resident reported that gas was stolen from a vehicle on Powder Spring Road. Vermont State Police’s St. Johnsbury Barracks are investigating the incident.

Ted Cooper, senior sales consultant at Wells River Chevrolet, said the fuel thefts have been happening on and off for a couple of years. He could not recall similar thefts previously taking place during his more than 12 years working at the dealership.
“Now we try to put everything inside we can, but obviously we can’t put our entire inventory inside,” Cooper said. Over the past couple of years, Wells River Chevrolet has spent about $15,000 replacing fuel systems of vehicles with damaged tanks, he said.
The most recent thefts, which affected a few pickup trucks, occurred in mid-September. Employees discovered them after noticing a large puddle of gas spreading over the pavement under a truck, Cooper said.
A security camera picked up footage of a suspicious vehicle at the business in the early morning hours, but it was too blurry to make out an exact vehicle model or license plate number.
“We are in the process of greatly enhancing our video surveillance equipment and it’s going to be much harder to evade because there are cameras now mounted in relatively invisible places and at lower angles in order to be able to see things like plate numbers, faces, etc.,” Cooper said.
In the nine years he has owned Route 5 Auto, Gherardi said he has had vehicles broken into and even stolen, but gas thefts are new.
“It’s dangerous,” Gherardi said about the thefts, adding that gasoline had run out of the vehicles and into the road. “What if someone is driving down the road and decides to toss a cigarette out?”
Even though the gas tanks are plastic, the drill used to get the gas could still have created a spark, Gherardi said. “It wouldn’t take much for it to blow up.”
He is also puzzled by the crime in general because of the cost of gas. The average cost of a gallon of gas in Orange County is $3.17 per gallon, according to AAA.
“I think it’s crazy,” Gherardi said. “I just wouldn’t think it’s worth it.”

Donny Lambeth (R- Forsyth) speaks at the Joint Legislative Meeting on Medicaid Tuesday October 14, 2025. (Photo by Galen Bacharier)North Carolina Republican lawmakers on Tuesday criticized state health officials for moving ahead with Medicaid provider rate cuts lawmakers say were unnecessary.
“I’m still very upset about the rate cut,” said Sen. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Medicaid. “They have the power to hold off on those rate cuts, and in the 12 years I’ve been here, we have never cut rates. If we were short on Medicaid, we filled that with new money later in the year.”
The comments came during an oversight meeting where state officials defended 3% to 10% provider payment cuts that took effect Oct. 1. The reductions are intended to offset a $368 million budget shortfall caused by rising costs. 
Medicaid spending is growing faster than the state economy, driven by increasing behavioral health needs and rising prescription drug prices. Pharmacy spending alone has climbed 8.6% annually, DHHS Chief Strategy Officer Julia Lerche told lawmakers.
“This is not the direction the department wanted to go,” Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for NC Medicaid told the Committee. “If the General Assembly appropriates the funding needed to run the program, we have designed our response to be reversible, and we are committed to reversing those provider rate cuts as soon as practically possible.”
Lambeth said DHHS should have consulted legislators before implementing the reductions. “We shouldn’t be sitting here in October getting the answer from them on how they decided to make those cuts,” he said. “We should have had that discussion back in July or August.”
“Unfortunately, we don’t operate with the budget we wish we had,” Ludlam responded. “We operate with the budget we do have, and we’ve had to act like a business and reduce costs in order to manage the budget that was appropriated.”
Lambeth also criticized how the cuts were distributed, saying smaller programs such as autism therapy providers were hit harder than large hospital systems. “To decide they’re going to cut a little group like autism by $70,000, when big hospitals could probably absorb that, is just not fair and equitable in my opinion,” Lambeth said.
Rep. Donna White (R-Johnston) called the move “very shocking and very hurtful,” warning that agencies serving people with disabilities and chronic illnesses might be forced to turn patients away or close.
“We can do better than this, and we can start today,” White said. “When we look at agencies possibly having to close down, or having to not admit the sickest and most fragile in our communities — this is very hurtful.”
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein has blamed Republican legislators for not allocating enough money to maintain Medicaid rates. The stopgap budget passed in July fell about $319 million short of what the program needed to cover its costs, according to the administration. DHHS warned lawmakers in August that the cuts would be made unless the legislature approved additional funding.
The Senate and House passed their respective Medicaid funding bills last month, but they remain at odds. Senate leaders wanted to include money for a new children’s hospital and money for rural hospitals, while House Republicans were pushing for a “clean bill” without the extra money. So, to date, no additional money has been appropriated to the program. 
Medicaid leaders said they waited as long as they could for more funding, but had to move ahead with cuts October 1.
Since Medicaid expansion launched, about 685,000 additional residents have enrolled. The program now covers one in four North Carolinians and two in five children, funded mostly by federal dollars.
Meanwhile the cuts are rippling across providers. Agencies serving people with developmental disabilities are absorbing 8% reductions, while some dental practices say Medicaid now reimburses only about 35% of actual costs. A survey by the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians and the Pediatric Society found 44% of practices may limit Medicaid patients and nearly 10% may stop accepting them altogether, NC Newsline has reported.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3900-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 18:57:31.436809

Florida has more to lose than any other state if Congress doesn’t extend enhanced premium tax credits for so-called Obamacare coverage.
That was the message a trio of Democratic members of Congress delivered Tuesday on Day 14 of the government shutdown. At the center of the shutdown is a partisan battle over extending the tax credits to lower the costs of health care coverage. 
The credits expire at the end of the year. Democrats are holding up government funding to pressure Republicans into extending them. While Republicans have said they are open to talks, they insist Democrats vote to continue government operations until late November.

“If Trump and Republicans continue to refuse to negotiate our way out of this health care coverage crisis, it’s going to be absolutely brutal, disproportionately for Florida,” said U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Weston.
Florida leads the nation in the number of people who purchase insurance through the federal exchange (healthcare.gov), which was established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), sometimes called Obamacare. 
U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data from March show that of the 4.7 million Florida residents with an Obamacare plan in 2025, 4.6 million receive the tax credits.
Obamacare enrollment for 2026, meanwhile, is set to begin next month.
“If these credits expire, millions of people will — and thousands of people that we represent,  really, hundreds of  thousands — will face double, triple, or quadruple price hikes in their [health insurance] premiums. That’s not exaggeration or hyperbole. We’ve seen the notices,” said Wasserman Schultz, whose district includes 209,000 Obamacare enrollees, 203,000 of whom receive the tax credits. 
“We’ve talked to insurance companies and we know that that’s what’s coming,” she added. “And you all know what that really means. Families will be forced to drop coverage, chronic diseases will go undiagnosed, ERs will be flooded.”
Joining Wasserman Schultz in a Zoom meeting were U.S. Reps. Darren Soto and Maxwell Frost, who said the loss of the enhanced premiums plus Florida’s decision to not expand Medicaid to low-income childless adults will prove devastating.
Soto said his congressional district has the second highest Obamacare enrollment (271,000) in the nation.
U.S. Rep. Darren Soto via U.S. House.
“And there’s a good reason for that. We have a lot of folks working for small businesses. We have a lot of folks who are independent contractors, and they don’t have access to affordable, employer-based health care, so they’ve gone on the exchange, and the fact that Florida didn’t expand Medicaid only made it more desperate for folks to have to use the ACA exchange,” Soto said.
He added: “Remember when Donald Trump ran on lowering costs? Well, now he’s running away from lowering costs with this key negotiation.”
Advanced premium tax credits have been available since passage of the Affordable Care Act. During COVID, Congress agreed to make the premium tax credits more generous. Those enhanced credits lower out-of-pocket costs for the coverage and allow people who earn more money to qualify for the subsidies.
Only Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas (all of which have lower Obamacare enrollment) have lower average monthly premiums.

While the battle over the tax credits has been partisan, conservatives including Associated Industries of Florida President and CEO Brewster Bevis, Florida Hospital Association President and CEO Mary Mayhew, President and CEO of Florida Association of Community Health Centers Jonathan Chapman, and President and CEO of the Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Julio Fuentes aligned under the Florida Conservatives for Affordable Health Care moniker and came out in support of their continuation over the summer.
“I have been around this debate over health care coverage for decades and, while the politics of the ACA have been heated over the years, there should be a unified political voice in support of the federal marketplace and the premiums assistance in Florida,”  Mayhew said during a press conference this summer.
U.S. Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody both oppose extending the tax credits. Moody’s position could hurt her election bid next year, a public opinion survey conducted by the Tyson Group shows.

Scott, the multimillionaire former health care executive who launched his political career opposing Obamacare, doubled down on his opposition to the longstanding federal health care law last week on Fox News’ The Sunday Briefing.
Working class hero
For his part, Frost said the argument is an extension of the battle this summer over the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” and that he was “proud” that Democrats are “standing strong” on the issue.
“We are the party of the working class, we’re the party of working people, and we don’t want people’s health care costs to go up anywhere from 50% to 300%. We don’t want millions of people in this country losing their health care, because we believe health care is a human right for every single person in this country, and that’s what we’re fighting for,” he said.
Frost said his office has asked constituents to share videos of themselves talking about the looming health insurance premium increases they face. His office, he said, has been posting them online.
One “heartbreaking” story he described involved a woman who said her monthly premiums were about to double.
Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
“She’s having to cut from her grocery trips. She had to cancel a trip to go see her parents that she hasn’t seen in a long, long time. And a lot of people are considering having to change their housing situation because the rent is too damn high,” Frost said. 
“We have to remember that Donald Trump is throwing us into this healthcare crisis while he’s also thrown us into a grocery store crisis, while he’s also thrown us into a housing crisis, even worse than it ever was before. Everything is so much more expensive.”
With wages stagnant and costs of living increasing, Frost said, “working people just need a break, and taking away their health care — it’s one of the most inhumane things a person can do.”










He spent a bunch of our government money to campaign against Amendment 4 last year. Why is he spending no government money to make sure people know that their health care is about to go up by an insane amount because of Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress?”

Silence
Meanwhile, state political leaders to date have been silent on the issue.
The three Democrats were critical of Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworski and Gov. Ron DeSantis for not warning state residents about the increases.
“Absolutely,” Soto said when asked whether the governor and insurance commissioner should be making people aware.
“They can’t hide these numbers. Obviously, people want to know, and they should know, and there’s a duty to tell them ahead of time.”
Frost said DeSantis and Yaworski are motivated by political considerations.
“The governor knows that in about a year, he’s going to become pretty irrelevant on the national stage, and he’s trying to find relevancy. He doesn’t want to rub Trump the wrong way. And so instead of looking out for Floridians and what’s best for the people he’s supposed to lead and represent, he’s going to keep his mouth shut and continue to play partisan games,” Frost said. 
OIR presentation
Meanwhile, OIR Deputy Commissioner for Life and Health Alexis Bakofsy updated the House Health Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee Tuesday afternoon, including news that a statewide average 34% increase in premiums will take effect Jan. 1.
An OIR slide presentation shows the state expects Obamacare enrollment to “drop significantly during 2026 Open Enrollment with the expiration of enhanced subsidies & Federal Rule implementation.” OIR has a demographic breakout but Bakofsy said she didn’t have the information available with her.
She did tell committee members that 95% of Obamacare enrollees live in a county with at least four carriers. Monroe County is the only area in the state with only one health insurer offering a Obamacare plan through the exchange, the result of Aetna exiting the market (in Florida and nationally.)
Bakofsy repeatedly said Florida consumers should shop, given the changes that are occurring.
“When I say ‘shop’ I mean understand how you’re going to be impacted both on the exchange but also what are your options off exchange. Every consumer is going to be different to the extent that we can provide you with resources so that they can go. I would hate for someone to come to Dec. 15 and realize that the plan that they had, the plan they want to keep, is no longer available.”
Bakofsy also told members that the OIR plans to collect data on enrollment and claims starting next year to ensure the office can effectively track participation in the market.
The OIR had not publicized the steep rate increases, a fact that Bakofsy acknowledged and which irked committee member and state Rep. Robin Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston.
Bartleman said many residents haven’t even received notice from insurance companies warning them of the rate increases (Florida law requires the notice to go out 45 day in advance. Bakofsy said that gives the carriers until mid-November to send the notices).
“So, what? What is your plan? Because everyone this committee, we’re going to be left holding that ball, and we had nothing to do with this. But you work for the state. You work for the governor. What are you going to do, because it’s not just low-income people or minority people. I can give you the numbers of every person in this community and how many people in your district aren’t going to be able to afford health care insurance. What can you do to help us, help Floridians get this information out?”

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has lined up a popular Providence-based clamshack and seafood wholesaler as the anchor tenant for the former Chase Marina beneath the Sakonnet River Bridge in Tiverton.
The State Properties Committee on Tuesday unanimously gave preliminary approval for a 10-year lease for Dune Brothers LLC to occupy the building at 169 Riverside Drive. A copy of the agreement was not immediately made available. The building is two stories on its west end and one story on the east end.
The DEM acquired the building from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation in 2021 in order to redevelop the property as part of a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to grow the state’s blue economy. The building previously served as a privately owned marina and kayak shop.
Established in 2017 by spouses Nicholas and Monica Gillespie, Dune Brothers originally operated seasonal clam shacks near downtown Providence and across the Seekonk River in East Providence. The business has since expanded to a sit down location and market in Providence’s Fox Point neighborhood, along with a wholesale market in Warwick.
The Gillespies did not immediately respond to request for comment Tuesday.
Dan Costa, DEM’s port manager, told the State Properties Committee the redeveloped marina site would be home to a new market and restaurant.
The 0.26-acre site on which the building sits includes an attached marina with room for up to 19 berths for commercial fishing vessels, Costa said. Docking space is still being engineered, he added.
“This land lease is going to be a complement to that marina facility,” Costa said. “I believe this is a wonderful opportunity for the DEM to preserve our working waterfront and further the state’s mission in supporting the commercial fishing community.”
In addition to Dune Brothers, the DEM would have a satellite office within the building for the agency’s divisions of Coastal Resources, Emerging Fisheries, and Law Enforcement.
“We have no presence in the East Bay to continue furthering our missions,” Costa said. “It’s going to be a great benefit.”
The state solicited bids from prospective tenants between April and July of 2025, DEM spokesperson Kim Keough said. Dune Brothers submitted one of only two responses.
Troy Langknecht, the chief of program development for DEM’s Natural Resources Bureau, told the committee that the proposed deal calls on Dune Brothers to pay $14.50 per square foot — totaling $82,230 per year.
But just when the business can start occupying the space is unclear. Langknecht told officials that the 5,671 square-foot former seafood processing facility still requires “significant improvements.”
As of Tuesday, a few desks, a filing cabinet, and a sign left over from the building’s time as a staging ground during the 2018 demolition of the old Sakonnet River Bridge were visible inside the one-story portion of the building fronting Riverside Drive.
“It is in pretty good shape, but definitely not ready for any kind of business,” Langknecht said.
The state will offer Dune Brothers a rent abatement of approximately $58,710 each year over the 10-year term, she said. The total of $587,096 is the estimated cost to correct deferred maintenance of the building. After the capital improvement deduction, the annual rental fee will be $23,520.
DEM officials hope to have a lease in place early 2026, Keough said in an email to Rhode Island Current.

Hanscom Field located between Bedford, Lexington and Concord by adding 17 new hangars. The publicly-owned airfield holds the most private jets in New England.""","ACTIVISTS OPPOSING the Hanscom Airfield expansion proposal are calling recent recommendations to utilize sustainable aviation fuels “a disingenuous greenwashing campaign” as lawmakers leading on the issue maintained that the governor and Massport must put a stop to the plan. 
The Massachusetts Port Authority proposal, which has faced years of opposition, would expand the Lawrence G. Hanscom Field located between Bedford, Lexington and Concord by adding 17 new hangars. The publicly-owned airfield holds the most private jets in New England, and an October 2023 report found private jets from the field accounted for an estimated 106,676 tons of carbon emissions over an 18-month period. 
Activists on Tuesday aired concerns about increased carbon emissions from private jets that serve the wealthy. They drew attention to a Massachusetts Sustainable Aviation Fuel Workgroup report, which recommended that the state advance the implementation of SAF, a type of jet fuel made from renewable sources. 
The working group report suggests that SAF has “the potential to dramatically reduce life cycle aviation emissions … and avoid indirect impacts on forests and croplands.” It also recommends creating a Massachusetts and New England Regional SAF Hub “to secure buy-in from key stakeholders, facilitate information sharing, and identify priority short- and long-term initiatives that build SAF momentum.”
But a new report from the D.C.-based think tank Institute for Policy Studies claims that utilizing SAF in this project or others will not help Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is not a “feasible” way to reduce emissions at scale. 
“SAF won’t help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change. It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment,” Chuck Collins, co-author of the think tank’s report, said Tuesday.
“Hypothetical future use of SAF should not serve as a green light for expanding aviation. We find that SAF solutions provide minimal or negative greenhouse gas reductions,” the report says. It calls studying SAF “logical” but suggests “proposals to drive production or consumption of SAF through economic policy or subsidies do not make financial sense, as SAF currently and for the foreseeable future increases GHG emissions.”
Massport maintains that the renewable fuel “represents one of the most immediate and effective tools available today to reduce aviation’s climate impact and enable emission reductions without compromising reliability or safety.”
The agency is “committed to reducing aviation-related emissions and promoting more sustainable practices across all our facilities, including Hanscom Field,” Massport said in a statement to the News Service. “We understand there are a range of opinions, and we’re committed to continuing the conversation with our neighbors to find the right balance between environmental goals, airport operations, and economic growth.”
Lincoln resident Alex Chatfield criticized the focus on SAF in the midst of opposition to the Hanscom project. 
“If Massport thinks that we will be distracted by the supposedly bright, shiny object of SAFs and accept the North Airfield project, because someday, a few decades from now, some highly expensive and still environmentally damaging but differently produced fuel is being sold there, they have badly underestimated our determination to stop this project,” Chatfield said.
Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper in 2024 rejected a draft environmental impact report filed by Runway Realty Ventures and North Airfield Ventures to expand the Hanscom airfield. The developers are expected to submit a supplemental draft environmental impact report to address environmental and community impacts and concerns by the end of the year, Chatfield said. 
“There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate. This is it. This is the inflection point for Massport,” Sen. Michael Barrett said during a State House briefing. 
“The same in some ways is true for the Legislature and executive branch, also. It is going to be very, very difficult for your elected officials to make the case that we prioritize fighting climate [change] if this particular deal goes down,” Barrett continued. 
Activists on Tuesday delivered another letter to Healey calling on her to put a stop to the project, after conservation and historic preservation groups delivered a different letter and petition to her in April.
Barrett recalled the decision of former Gov. Frank Sargent in the 1970s to reject the Inner Belt project, which Barrett said would have decimated neighborhoods in Somerville, Cambridge and Boston.
“Sargent took a look at that seeming inevitability and said, ‘Not on my watch – that is a bad decision. I’m thinking about the future, and I can see that this would get it wrong,'” Barrett said. “So we’re asking our current governor, who’s done so much good work on other issues, to appreciate that there is a precedent for her saying just, ‘No, not on my watch.'”
A petition created by the Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere group, which calls on Healey to stop the expansion plans, has more than 14,500 signatures. 
“It’s a matter of political will,” Rep. Carmine Gentile said. “Massachusetts has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. How can we take that goal seriously if we greenlight projects like this? We can’t,” Gentile said. “How can we tell working families to switch to electric cars, to insulate their homes, take the T while letting the ultra rich burn jet fuel to [take] quick flights to the Caribbean? That would be a moral failure.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Barrett-Michael-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 17:57:31.064755

Justices plan to hear the case starting at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 5. The court also plans to hear oral arguments in six unrelated cases.
In Attorney General v. Eli Lilly and Company, Nessel sought to investigate the drug manufacturer to determine if its pricing practices for insulin violated the Michigan Consumer Protection Act.
‘You can’t win a case you never file’ 

Nessel petitioned the Ingham Circuit Court for civil investigative subpoenas under the act, but, in a separate complaint filed with the court, she also filed a motion for a declaratory judgment. The motion asked a judge to preliminarily hold that her investigation was not barred by the act’s exemptions for conduct already authorized by a regulatory agency, the state or federal government.
The attorney general noted in her motion that the state viewed Nessel’s interpretation of the act as out of step with the Michigan Supreme Court’s decisions in Smith v. Globe Life Insurance Company and Liss v. Lewiston-Richards Inc. Nessel asserted that both of those cases were wrongly decided.
Eli Lilly said that was a poor read of the act, and asked the circuit court to dismiss the case. The court agreed with Eli Lilly, a decision that Nessel appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals.
Michigan AG argues for reversal of rulings that prevent insulin pricing investigation

Nessel also attempted to bypass the appellate court and take the case straight to the high court. Justices rejected that attempt and placed the case back before the Court of Appeals.
The appellate court affirmed the circuit court’s decision to dismiss the case in an unpublished opinion, which means the opinion was not binding on the lower courts or necessarily instructive to the Michigan Supreme Court.
Back before the high court, Nessel is asking the justices to determine whether she has a claim that can be adjudicated in state court, and whether she needs to do so under the auspices of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act for the case to move forward.
The court has also been asked to determine whether the precedential cases in Smith and Liss were correctly decided, and if not, whether they should be retained under the doctrine of stare decisis, a maxim holding that decisions in precedential cases are settled law and are the guidestar for similar unsettled cases.

When the Boston Foundation’s Latino Equity Fund released “The ROI of ESOL,” documenting the economic returns of English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) education for immigrant workers, the plan was to catalyze immediate policy action. Unfortunately, we released it in February 2020, just weeks before COVID shut down the world and policymakers shifted to a different set of emergency priorities. 
But when we revisited workforce development for immigrant workers alongside a powerful coalition of organizations last fall, the timing couldn’t have been better. Labor shortages across industries had employers desperately seeking skilled workers. The state’s Fair Share Amendment had created new revenue streams for transportation and education. 
Federal threats to immigrant services inspired advocates and lawmakers to step up at the state level. Gov. Healey’s signature on the $10 million vocational ESOL appropriation this June demonstrated how strategic coalitions can capitalize on policy windows when they finally open. For policymakers nationwide grappling with immigrant workforce integration, the Massachusetts experience offers crucial lessons about both patience and preparation. 
The Commonwealth’s demographics have long illustrated the need for ESOL investments. For decades, Massachusetts has experienced an increase in its foreign-born workforce, but despite a proud history, an abundance of trusted ESOL providers, and a deeper commitment to state funding than many other states, our ESOL efforts have not matched the scale of the need. Waitlists continue to grow, job trainers have struggled to provide proper English curricula, and available ESOL training hasn’t always met the needs of foreign language-speaking job seekers.  
That’s not to say there haven’t been wins. The economic disruptions of the pandemic triggered interest in new investments in programs to reskill workers. Working in partnership with the Workforce Solutions Group and JVS Boston, we successfully persuaded the Baker administration to invest millions in ARPA funding to expand ESOL programs in colleges and workplaces.  
More recently, we collaborated with the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action (JALSA) and others on advocating for improved services for immigrants in state shelters, while other partners, such as MIRA and the African Bridge Network, have successfully advocated for legislation that makes it easier for foreign-trained physicians to practice in Massachusetts, providing warranted opportunities for professionals who can help meet the local need for health care providers. 
Meanwhile, a broader coalition was forming. Beginning in the fall of 2023, at the urging of groups including Caribbean Youth Club and English for New Bostonians, SkillWorks and the Boston Foundation began convening representatives from more than 40 immigrant support groups and job training programs to find common ground on an immigrant worker agenda. Conversations quickly centered on the need for better coordination and funding across state systems supporting immigrants, with a particular focus on ESOL for employment. 
Under the banner of the English for a Strong Economy (ESE) coalition, we developed a sophisticated policy framework connecting vocational English training directly to career pathway programming. Through numerous meetings, we developed proposed legislation to enhance system coordination and agreed to advocate for necessary increases in ESOL funding.  
Coalition members combined rigorous research with strategic advocacy. Research published by the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, Eastern Bank Foundation, Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, and MassINC built upon the original “ROI of ESOL” report to make a macro-level case for change. We then rallied around the MassINC report to frame our requests. New qualitative research from the African Bridge Network and the Latino Equity Fund added depth, capturing stories of the barriers that block skilled workers from career advancement.  
Partners are continuing to lean in, recently highlighted by Eastern Bank Foundation’s $10 million commitment to workforce ESOL, and the attention on the issue is increasing private donor interest in supporting ESOL providers. 
In short, rigorous research combined with strategic advocacy created a virtuous cycle, sparking government investment that in turn catalyzed philanthropic resources and increased interest in ongoing advocacy.  
Continuing that cycle is vital. Currently, even with expanded funding, workers face a maze of disconnected programs across community colleges, workforce agencies, and community organizations. Employers struggle to identify which programs align with their industry needs. Our advocacy wins won’t provide full value until we create more seamless pathways that enable workers to transition from basic ESOL to vocational English through industry-specific training and employer-connected job placement. 
This means developing shared best practices for vocational ESOL curricula, creating common assessments and measurements that support progress in language and job training, expanding access to wrap-around support for participants, and recognizing that the path to a job will look different for different immigrants. It will require technology infrastructure that allows workers to access services across multiple agencies, organizations, and data systems and enables employers to easily identify workers with both English language proficiency and job-relevant skills. 
Bringing these pieces together may well be more challenging than finding funding. It requires policy frameworks that incentivize collaboration over competition, funding mechanisms that reward system-wide outcomes rather than individual organizational metrics, and regulatory approaches that standardize quality while allowing programmatic flexibility. 
We have the interest, but we need the will. The question for fiscal year 2026 and beyond isn’t whether to invest more in ESOL—it’s whether Massachusetts will seize this moment to build the comprehensive system that can truly serve workers and employers at scale. The foundation is built. The system design work begins now.

The request from the university comes on the heels of the General Assembly passing a law earlier this year to allow public universities to offer more professional and advanced degree programs. That legislation, which had bipartisan support, allows public universities to seek approval to start professional programs such as medicine or architecture and to offer doctor of philosophy degrees. 
KSU is asking to begin offering Ph.D. programs in agroecology and sustainability and aquaculture/aquatic science under the university’s land grant umbrella. KSU, located in Frankfort, is the state’s only public historically Black college or university. 
University officials appearing before the Interim Joint Committee on Education on Tuesday reiterated throughout their presentation that offering the programs would be at no cost to the state and the university plans to generate revenue for the programs from federal and other funding sources. 
Among questions asked by lawmakers during the meeting, Republican Senate Floor Leader Max Wise, of Campbellsville, asked the KSU officials how many of the university’s graduate students would be retained by the new doctoral programs and if students could be recruited from other universities. 
KSU President Koffi Akakpo said the graduate aquaculture program has around 25 students who are about to graduate and most of them could be retained by KSU if it had a Ph.D. program. The university had more than 40 students graduating from graduate programs in agriculture in the spring. 
Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, asked how the programs could help improve the financial stability of KSU moving forward. In recent years, and before Akakpo was named president, the university has dealt with a number of controversies, including misused funds under a former administration. The legislature in 2022 put the university under a management improvement plan and provided $23 million to help it recover from a budget hole.
“It’s going to generate more revenue to the university,” Akakpo said. “As I said, we have the scholarship, but we have to give it to students to bring that money, to keep that money. If we don’t give it to students, we cannot keep that money.”
Marcus Bernard, the dean of the College of Agriculture, Health, and Natural Resources at KSU, told lawmakers that the creation of the two Ph.D. programs would provide a path for the university to reach “R2 status,” or a high research activity classification from the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.
Andrew Ray, the chair of the School of Aquaculture and Aquatic Science, said the programs would “lead to a much higher skilled workforce in these two critical areas” and allow the university to retain students. Maheteme Gebremedhin, the chair of the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources, echoed that in his remarks, saying that year after year, KSU trains master’s level students and they leave Kentucky to apply to doctoral programs elsewhere. 
“There is a compelling case to make in terms of the economic viability of the program. Highly skilled workforces are the cornerstone of Kentucky agriculture, and we want to capitalize on that,” Gebremedhin said. 
Federal officials are also interested in this topic. Ray noted that Republican President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year calling for the United States to be more competitive in the seafood market. The executive order directs Trump administration officials to “develop and implement an America First Seafood Strategy” that increases production and exports of U.S. fishery and aquaculture products and domestic processing capacity. 
Ray said “wild fisheries simply cannot supply” the demand for such products, but it’s something academics want to work on.
“I think we have a really unique opportunity here to work on this and to address this issue. We have an amazing program here,” he said. “It’s got the roots, it’s got the bones already built, and I’m ready to lead it, and the Ph.D. program will really help establish our leadership in this area.”

Officials with the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District are replacing and upgrading the Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam, which is located just east of Barber Park – a popular destination where thousands of people begin their float of the Boise River each summer. 
Little called the dam “a powerhouse in the Treasure Valley” and said the dam project will ensure farmers will continue to receive irrigation water they depend on.
“This project in particular will be a modernization into the 21st century, but it also has a safety and a fish aspect to it,” Little said. “So this is not just a pure irrigation project. It really checks all the boxes for what’s important in Idaho.”
Some of the funding for the $20 million dam project comes from $30 million that Little and the Idaho Legislature set aside during the 2025 legislative session for water infrastructure projects. 
To help pay for the project, the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District received approximately $10.7 million in funding from the Idaho Water Resource Board, which was part of the $30 million for water infrastructure projects. The Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District also received an approximately $4.7 million Bureau of Reclamation Watersmart Grant for the Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam project. 
 Dam project aims to distribute irrigation water throughout the Treasure Valley

The purpose of the Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam is to raise the water level, allowing water to be diverted from the Boise River into the Ridenbaugh Canal, where it is delivered to farms and lawns across the Treasure Valley for irrigation.

The existing Ridenbaugh Diversion Dam, which dates to the 1930s, has reached the end of its life, officials said. 
“We’re hopeful that our new facility will enable us to distribute irrigation water through the valley for another 100 years,” Donald Barksdale, president of the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District, said at the groundbreaking ceremony. 
Operating the existing dam and raising the water level requires a crew of three people to install and remove a series of 20-foot long boards by hand, even in stormy weather or when the dam’s walkway is iced over. 
Crews will replace that dam structure with a new automated system that includes gates and an 80-foot weir that will extend from the crest gate to the north river bank.

Crews will also install a screen to prevent adult fish from entering the Ridenbaugh Canal, officials said. 
During a press conference Tuesday, Greg Curtis, water superintendent for the Nampa and Meridian Irrigation District, said the cost of the project will not exceed $20.7 million and crews hope to finish it by spring of 2027. 
Construction work will be performed in the winter months to avoid the busy summer river floating season at Barber Park, Curtis said. Work begins on one side of the river immediately, and will continue until March or April, when work will stop before the floating season and the old boards will be put back in the dam. 
Construction work will then resume on the other side of the river next October, after river floating ends, and continue until completion, which is expected before the summer of 2027.

Ford/Maryland Matters)Jessica Weinberg enjoyed her job as a social scientist with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, helping communicate to the public the importance of medical devices such as pacemakers, brain implants and contact lenses.
But then Weinberg and her colleagues got word on April 1 they would be fired, the day she and her colleagues call “the April Fool’s Day public health massacre.”
“What has happened is a travesty, not just for me, my family and my community, but for the public health of the nation,” Weinberg said Tuesday.
“I am here speaking out, despite being taught for my entire 14-year career as a fed never to speak publicly,” she said. “I’m here balancing the need to spend time searching for jobs and providing for my family with the need to speak out about the travesty that has occurred and continues to unfold in this country.”

Speakers had particularly harsh words for OMB Director Russell Vought, who ordered the job cuts, as well as a fresh round of layoffs that began Friday, 10 days into the shutdown.
While several at the rally held up signs supporting workers, others held signs targeting Vought, including one with his face and the phrase, “Put them in trauma” — a reference to comments Vought reportedly made to describe his goal for the treatment of federal workers.
“Mr. Vought, you just heard about the trauma you are causing. Shame!” said Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), as he pointed toward OMB, as others started to chant, “Shame!”
Hoyer was one of seven Maryland legislators joined by four Virginia colleagues, including Sen. Mark Warner, who came to show their support for federal workers and criticize the administration.
“These experts [federal workers], the ones to ensure that America’s exceptionalism in so many cases, depends on our powers and research and science and medicine. These are the people who have been targeted by this administration and targeted by the very sinister Russell Vought,” said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.).
“We are not here by accident,” Alsobrooks said. “It was completely foreseeable that we would be here in this moment because it was always the plan of the Republican Party and the plan of Russell Vought.”
The White House referred questions Tuesday to OMB, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But while Democratic lawmakers have blamed the government shutdown on the Republicans who control Congress and the White House, Vice President J.D. Vance said Sunday on “Meet the Press” that the shutdown — and the subsequent layoffs — are the fault of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other congressional Democrats. He said the administration has been forced to “lay off some federal workers in the midst of this shutdown to preserve the essential benefits to the American people that the government does provide.”
“We don’t want to be laying off federal workers, but the Democrats have shut down the government. They have forced us to choose between American citizens and federal bureaucrats. We are choosing the critical services that benefit our American citizens.”

Vance’s comments come even though President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to slash the size of government and the Office of Personnel Management issued a memo on Trump’s first day in office directing agengy heads to identify probationary workers who “can be terminiated … without triggering appeal rights.”
Meanwhile, Trump this weekend directed the Pentagon to redirect research funds to pay active-duty troops during the government shutdown. The troops would have missed their first paycheck Wednesday, but the Defense Department said it would use $8 billion in “unobligated” research funds to make payroll.
House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who is keeping the House out until the Senate passes a budget, praised the president for “again showing strong leadership, has stepped up to ensure that our troops are going to be paid on Oct. 15.”
It remains unclear if the Trump administration has the legal authority to transfer the funds without congressional approval. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said Tuesday that it does not, that federal law states money appropriated for a certain agency must go directly to that agency.
“If it’s mandatory for a particular purpose, it’s got to serve that purpose,” Raskin said. “So they [the administration] shouldn’t start impounding, redirecting, rechanneling money in order to cover up for their own negligence. They should come back to work and reopen the federal government with us.”

A new report found Wisconsin gun deaths have increased since 2002.

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I want to keep sending a message to legislators that this violence is an epidemic, and something has to be done,” said Blanks, who volunteers with the advocacy group Moms Demand Action. “It’s not acceptable that we keep having so many lives cut short by gun violence.”
Firearms claimed the lives of 762 Wisconsinites in 2023, according to a report from the Wisconsin Anti-Violence Effort (WAVE) Educational Fund and the Violence Policy Center. This included suicides, homicides and other firearm deaths. 
The total number marks a decline from the 830 deaths reported for 2022 and the 793 deaths reported for 2021. The report also says that rates of overall suicide and firearm suicide in Wisconsin are similar to national rates, while homicide and firearm homicide rates are lower in Wisconsin than in the nation. 
However, overall rates of firearm suicides and firearm homicides have increased in Wisconsin since 2002. Since 2020, firearm deaths have reportedly outpaced motor vehicle deaths in Wisconsin. 
“One death from gun violence is too many,” Nick Matuszewski, associate executive director of the WAVE Educational Fund, said in a statement. “But 762 deaths is a disgrace and an urgent call to take the kind of actions that have been proven to save lives.” 
The 762 deaths include 502 firearm suicides and 236 firearm homicides. The report includes findings related to sex, age, race and ethnicity and rural and urban areas. 
WAVE reports that in 2023, suicides took up a larger percentage of firearms deaths in rural Wisconsin (88.5%) than in urban Wisconsin (58.2%). 
According to the report, guns were used in 54.6% of suicides and 83.1% of homicides in Wisconsin.
Black residents of Wisconsin were 40 times more likely to die by firearm homicide than white residents. The report states that an annual study by the Violence Policy Center found that Wisconsin had the fourth highest rate of Black homicide victimization in the nation in 2023. 
In 2023, 8,441 firearms were recovered in Wisconsin and traced, according to WAVE, most of which were handguns. The report found that 84.9% of firearms recovered in Wisconsin originated in the state.
The study was released the day before the Emergency Gun Violence Summit, which will take place Wednesday in Milwaukee.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-14 21:26:18+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT could bond $390M for UConn Health, including Waterbury Hospital purchase",Katy Golvala and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/14/ct-hospital-uconn-prospect-medical-waterbury/,The $390 million in funding would cover the $13 million acquisition of Waterbury Hospital from Prospect Medical Holdings.,"Connecticut plans to borrow $390 million to expand the footprint of its own struggling flagship medical institution, the University of Connecticut Health Center, while simultaneously ridding the state of hospitals under private equity ownership.
According to communications obtained this week by The Connecticut Mirror, the debt would be added to the “UConn 2000” bonding package, the state’s financing program for capital projects at its flagship university. 
The $390 million in borrowed funds would cover the $13 million acquisition of Waterbury Hospital from Prospect Medical Holdings, a now-bankrupt hospital operator that was formerly backed by private equity investment. The funding would also pay for “other future clinical partnerships,” according to the communication.
Last month, CT Mirror confirmed that UConn Health is also in talks to purchase Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam. It is not clear from the communications whether any of the additional funding would be used to pay for the acquisition of those two hospitals.
A significant portion of the funding would go toward investments in “IT, equipment, deferred maintenance and working capital,” the communication said. Waterbury Hospital, in particular, would need a major influx of capital funding to upgrade its systems, which are still recovering from a crippling cyberattack in 2023.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Prospect Medical Holdings.
UConn Health spokesperson Jennifer Walker deferred comment to the governor’s office. 
The nearly $400 million proposal does not address the hospital provider taxes Prospect owes the state, or its unpaid municipal taxes in Manchester and Waterbury.
As of last month, the Lamont administration was considering forgiving Prospect’s tax liabilities to the state as part of the deal for UConn Health to acquire Waterbury Hospital, according to several legislators who were briefed on the potential deal.
Prospect and its subsidiaries owe the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services as much as $100 million in “taxes or penalties,” according to court filings. However, state officials declined multiple requests to confirm Prospect’s total tax liability to the state.
The legislature would have to approve both the bonding and the tax forgiveness, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed. Ritter said the legislature would likely approve waiving Prospect’s tax bill.
“If we want to support UConn Health’s taking over the hospital then we will have to if it’s part of the deal,” Ritter said. “Otherwise you have to consider the alternatives — that the hospital could potentially close or some other private equity firm could come in and buy it.”
State Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, a physician at one of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals and a fervent critic of private equity in health care, said he agreed it would be the right move for the state, even though he doesn’t want to see Prospect “make money off the taxpayers.”
“I do think providing high-quality care to the people of Waterbury and beyond is absolutely essential,” said Anwar, who serves as co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee.
During a meeting in September, members of Gov. Lamont’s administration and leadership from the University of Connecticut presented a plan to legislators regarding UConn Health’s acquisition of Waterbury, Day Kimball and Bristol hospitals. Part of that plan included forgiving Prospect’s outstanding taxes to the state. However, several legislators in attendance said they have not heard an update regarding tax forgiveness since then.
The UConn expansion is part of a broader strategy to make the institution more competitive with other academic medical centers in the market. State officials also hope it will improve the financial stability of the institution, which has generated cash flow losses averaging $140 million per year between 2020 and 2023, according to a report released last year.
Prospect isn’t the only health system with unpaid taxes. Day Kimball owes the state roughly $41 million, according to a Sept. 4 DRS report, which means the state may have to grapple with that debt as well. Bristol Health owes less than $14,000 in taxes, according to the same report. 
In reference to the outstanding taxes, Day Kimball CEO Kyle Kramer said the hospital is “working together” with state officials toward “a long-term solution” and has been making payments.
Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas.
In September, Hartford HealthCare bid $86.1 million to purchase the other two Prospect-owned hospitals in Connecticut — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General. Additional bidders may submit offers through Oct. 16. A sale hearing, where the bankruptcy court judge will approve the preferred offer, is scheduled for Oct. 24. 
Yale New Haven Health was originally slated to purchase all three facilities in a $435 million deal reached in 2022. But the transaction became mired in legal disputes, with both health systems suing each other over the true value of the hospitals. The parties recently settled, with Yale New Haven agreeing to pay Prospect $45 million to exit the deal and end all pending litigation.
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. In a statement the same day, UConn Health CEO Andrew Agwunobi said UConn Health would submit the bid “in the coming week.” However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 14.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_20180220_103221.jpg,,,2025-10-14 17:57:31.064755
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-14 21:25:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Witness testifies he gave Kosta Diamantis thousands in cash,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/14/witness-testifies-he-gave-kosta-diamantis-thousands-in-cash/,Sal Monarca testified that he handed over cash bribes to Kosta Diamantis at a Dunkin' Donuts and in the Capital Grille's bathroom.,"Jurors listened to a third construction contractor testify on Tuesday about how he paid multiple bribes to Konstantinos Diamantis, a former state deputy budget director, in order to secure work on Connecticut school construction projects.
Sal Monarca, the former president of Acranom Masonry, was one of the first people on the witness stand during the second week of Diamantis’ ongoing criminal trial.
He explained to the jury in detail how he paid cash bribes to Diamantis in order to gain the former public official’s help in securing several school building contracts in Hartford and Tolland.
Federal prosecutors had Monarca explain to the jury how he wrote checks to himself out of his company’s bank account and how he would immediately cash those checks in order to secretly give tens of thousands of dollars to Diamantis.
Prosecutors also pushed Monarca to describe the various meeting locations where the two men would exchange the money.
Monarca told the jurors that he slipped Diamantis some of the bribes in a newspaper at a Dunkin’ Donuts. He said he handed over other envelopes of cash at Diamantis’ home in Farmington. And, as prosecutors alluded in their opening arguments, he described one exchange that took place in the bathroom of the Capital Grille in Hartford.
Prosecutors also showed Monarca several texts in which he, Diamantis and Acranom’s Vice President John Duffy discussed some of the encounters in Hartford. And they asked what it meant when the messages said that Diamantis wanted to meet up. 
“You had to pay,” Monarca said. 
“John would tell me where to meet him, and I’d go pay him,” he added. 
Norm Pattis, Diamantis’ attorney, attempted to pick apart pieces of Monarca’s testimony, as he did with the other witnesses in the trial last week.
Pattis suggested during questioning that the payments Monarca made to Diamantis might be for legal work, since Diamantis is an attorney. He also asked whether the payments were compensation for Diamantis introducing Monarca to D’Amato Construction, which is one of the largest construction firms in the state.
Meanwhile, prosecutors leaned heavily on the mountain of direct evidence that has been introduced during the trial to show that Monarca paid Diamantis so that Acranom would win multimillion-dollar construction contracts.
On one such project in Tolland, Monarca said, he and Duffy added $70,000 to their offer to build part of the Birch Grove Elementary school in order to factor in the expected payments for Diamantis.
And he explained how a feud broke out when he didn’t immediately pay that amount to Diamantis, who oversaw the budgets for school construction projects all over the state.
To drive home the point, prosecutors replayed a voicemail in which Diamantis referenced the Birch Grove project and complained Monarca had not held up his end of the deal. 
Diamantis sat motionless at the defense table as the voicemail was played for the second time during the trial. 

(Contains graphic language)
Pattis questioned Monarca about why he lied to federal investigators about the payments to Diamantis when he was first questioned. He also asked Monarca about about whether he could recall the exact dates that he delivered money to Diamantis.
All of it was meant to raise jurors’ doubts about Monarca’s testimony.
But Monarca repeatedly told Pattis and the prosecutors that he paid Diamantis in cash.
“I don’t know the dates, but if the texts said that, I paid him,” Monarca said. “I know I went to the bank multiple times and delivered it myself.”
Prosecutors used the next witness to shore up Monarca’s testimony.
Eric Wethje, a federal agent with the Internal Revenue Service, testified about the alleged lies that Diamantis told to federal investigators when he was interviewed in 2023.
He also walked the jury through the bank records that prosecutors say trace the money that flowed from Acranom to Diamantis.
During the investigation, Wethje created a list of occasions in which Monarca took cash out of Acranom’s account, and he detailed the times that Diamantis deposited cash into his private checking account shortly afterward.
Pattis pointed out issues with the summary of those transactions, however.
In several instances, Pattis noted, Diamantis actually deposited more cash into his account than Monarca allegedly paid him. 
Wethje agreed and said that Pattis’ math was correct. But he said that is because Diamantis’ frequently deposited large sums of cash into his bank account between 2018 and 2021 when he was running the school construction program. 
He said those types of transactions were “voluminous.” And he told Pattis that Diamantis was depositing that type of money despite only claiming his salary from the state of Connecticut on his taxes.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/monarca-1024x784.jpg,,,2025-10-14 17:57:31.064755

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the agreement with the Middle Eastern country on Friday for a facility to host Qatari troops at the base located just under 50 miles southeast of Boise. The plan had been in the works for years, including an agreement with Qatar to purchase F-15QA aircraft from the U.S. made in 2017, the Associated Press reported. 
Friday’s announcement received mixed responses from Idaho elected officials. 
A group of ultra-conservative Republicans in the Idaho Legislature, who call themselves the Gang of Eight, wrote a letter to Idaho’s congressional delegation on Sunday with concerns about the announcement and several questions about its implementation.

The group, including state Sen. Christy Zito, a Republican who lives in and represents Mountain Home, expressed concern about “Islamic terrorism” and the “lack of consultation with Idaho’s state leadership.” 
“In the interest of informing our constituents, promoting government transparency, and collaboration between federal and state legislators, we respectfully request answers to the following questions,” the letter said.  
The questions included those about funding, screening and vetting of trainees, and similar agreements with other nations, such as the existing training program with Singapore at the Mountain Home base. 
State Rep. Faye Thompson of McCall also represents the legislative district that houses the Mountain Home base and signed the letter. Joining Zito and Thompson were state Sens. Glenneda Zuiderveld of Twin Falls and Josh Kohl of Twin Falls, as well as state Reps. Lucas Cayler of Caldwell, Kent Marmon of Caldwell, Clint Hostetler of Twin Falls, and David Leavitt of Twin Falls.

  Idaho governor, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee haven’t publicly commented on agreement

Republican U.S. Senator for Idaho Jim Risch, who chairs the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, had not publicly commented on the decision as of Tuesday afternoon. Idaho Gov. Brad Little also had not released a statement or response to the announcement. 
Risch and Little’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Idaho U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson wrote on the social media platform X that he supported the deal. 
“Fantastic news for Mountain Home Air Force Base as (Hegseth) just announced the Pentagon has agreed to host Qatari F-15 fighter jets and pilots here in Idaho,” Simpson wrote Friday. “This development is beneficial for training, enhances our partnership with America’s allies, and strengthens national security.”

Idaho U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo said in an emailed statement to the Sun, “As I await further details about the agreement, I will continue working with Air Force and Mountain Home base leadership to ensure they have the support necessary to fulfill goals of global military readiness that keep Idahoans and Americans safe and protect our long-term national security interests.”
Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher also could not be reached for comment.
 Idaho Democrats, Risch challenger push back on Mountain Home Air Force Base agreement 

Democrats in Idaho criticized the announcement. 
“Trump accepted a $400 million luxury jet from Qatar, then his regime quietly approved building a Qatari military installation right here in Idaho,” the Idaho Democratic Party posted Friday on X.  “He sold out our security and used our state as part of the payoff.” 
The plans for the training facility and sale of the fighter jets to Qatar predated Qatar’s gift of the jumbo jet to President Donald Trump. The Air Force announced the agreement for training in 2020. 
Idaho Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terri Pickens called on Little to pause the deal in an emailed statement. 
“This isn’t just a foreign-relations issue — it’s a direct threat to Idaho’s sovereignty, our security, and the rights of Idahoans,” Pickens wrote. “Letting outsiders use our military infrastructure poses serious security and intelligence risks. Governor Little must tell the president to put a pause on this deal before it goes any further.”
Todd Achilles, an independent candidate challenging Risch for his U.S. Senate seat, wrote in a statement to the press, “I have one question for Senator Risch…Were you in on this?”

The domain “kevinbergerforcongress.com” was created Tuesday, drawing online attention from the North Carolina political world as Berger and the General Assembly prepare for a mid-decade redistricting push. The identity of the person who registered the site is not available to the public.
The domain change was first flagged by Carolina Forward, a left-leaning group, on social media; a cross-check of the domain name on ICANN, a nonprofit tool that tracks online registration data, confirms that it was created Tuesday.

Kevin Berger serves as a Rockingham County commissioner. His father, Phil, has been the N.C. Senate President Pro Tem since 2011. Kevin’s brother, Phil Jr., serves on the N.C. Supreme Court. Phil Jr. ran for Congress in 2014, losing a primary to former U.S. Rep. Mark Walker.
NC Newsline contacted Kevin Berger Tuesday to ask if he had registered the domain and whether he was planning to run for Congress. Berger said he was unaware of the domain name registration, but did not provide a direct answer about a potential candidacy.
“I am not familiar with what you are talking about,” Berger said by text message. “I would encourage you to reach out to whomever contacted you to find out about the domain name.”
When asked again whether he would run for Congress, he responded, “I support Virginia Foxx.”

Foxx, 82, currently represents the county in Washington. But with another round of redistricting on the horizon, Rockingham County could fall within the bounds of a new or significantly altered district.
Asked whether his answer would change if he found himself residing in a new district with an open seat, Berger responded, “I have no reason to believe that would occur.”
Berger, who chairs the county board, won one of three open seats on the board in November, earning 24.2% of the vote.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)White House Border Czar Tom Homan visited Indiana on Tuesday to tout successes under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — and urge Hoosier lawmakers to pass a bill they killed earlier this year.
“We’re going to send a message to the whole world. It’s not okay to enter this country illegally. It’s a crime,” he said. He spoke as part of a “Fairness for Hoosiers” event at the Statehouse.
Republican lawmakers and other attendees cheered and clapped throughout Homan’s 20-minute speech, while a small group of Westside Indianapolis residents protested the visit.
“Hoosier hospitality for every nationality!” they called from across the Statehouse, on the other side of a security line that only attendees, state employees and reporters could cross. Initially the event was set to be held in the public atrium but it was moved at the last minute to the House Chamber, and public and media weren’t allowed inside. It was livestreamed for Hoosiers.

Homan, who was acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first administration, said the president gave him three tasks after winning back the White House.
“One, secure the border. Two, run the largest deportation operation this country’s seen. Three, find over 300,000 missing children,” Homan recounted.
Border crossings have dropped from more than 10,000 daily to less than 100 last Friday, he said — and all were detained or deported.
Deportations have ticked up to nearly 550,000 since Trump re-took office in late January, per Homan. Another 1.6 million people have self-deported.
The search for unaccompanied child migrants is ongoing.

Homan accused former President Joe Biden’s administration of “allow(ing) half a million children to be trafficked” across the border and of “releas(ing) them to unvetted sponsors.”
Republicans have claimed that upwards of 300,000 children were “lost” beginning last summer, after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a report showing that ICE didn’t serve notices to appear in court to 291,000 children and that another 32,000 were notified but failed to show up for immigration court hearings. The data is from October 2018 to September 2023.
“I told the president, out of the three things you gave me, this is the hardest,” Homan said. “And why is that? Because we can find you. We can find me. We have a digital footprint. You own a home, you got a car, you got credit cards, you pay utility bills.
“How do we find a child? Well, we have to count on the paperwork of the sponsor. If that paperwork wasn’t vetted and done right, that’s almost useless too. So we’re out there every day looking for these children,” he continued.
Homan said almost 24,000 have been “rescued,” adding, “We’re not going to stop until we run every lead down.”
Immigration bill revived
Homan was the final — and highest-profile — speaker to push lawmakers into passing a controversial, previously unsuccessful immigration bill.
Attorney General Todd Rokita and Gov. Mike Braun — along with lobbyist and former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf — also plugged it.
“The FAIRNESS Act is the next step to protecting Hoosiers communities. It will further strengthen immigration enforcement and give (Rokita) the tools to protect our citizens. Indiana is not a sanctuary state,” Braun posted on social media.
House Bill 1531 would have required all levels of Hoosier government to comply with federal detainer requests. ICE often asks local police and others to keep “potentially dangerous aliens” behind bars for 48 hours longer so it can take them into custody.
If Rokita had labeled a government entity as noncompliant, Braun could’ve withheld state funding and grants for up to a year.

“The fact of the matter is, there is no country, and therefore no Indiana, if we don’t have a defined border, one language and a common culture,” Rokita said. 
The legislation also would’ve banned employers from “knowingly or intentionally” recruiting, hiring or employing people not allowed to work in the U.S. Violators could’ve had their operating authorizations suspended.
“This is critical to protect our workers and end the magnet that draws illegal immigration to our factories and communities,” Rokita said. “It’s pro-business, it’s pro-worker, and it’s pro-Hoosier legislation.”
The bill passed the House on a 64-26 vote, but died after the Senate Judiciary Committee declined to hold a hearing. Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, leads the committee.
Rokita called her out by name, telling the audience, “That decision set us back at least a full year. We can’t afford further delays.”
Author Rep. J.D. Prescott, R-Union City, plans to reintroduce the legislation, now named the FAIRNESS Act: Fostering and Advancing Immigration Reforms Necessary to Ensure Safety and Security. The next regular legislative session begins in January.
“Hopefully that becomes law, folks,” Homan said.
“If you would, please help President Trump,” he added. “I think it’s a great bill.”

His fellow Republicans selected him unanimously, lauding him as “Diamond Jim,” although these public announcements are purely ceremonial — future House speakers and Senate presidents are chosen years ahead of time.
“This moment is not about me. It is about the institution we serve, the legacy we inherit, and the future we are called to build together,” Boyd said from the rostrum. “My vision is a Florida that remains the beacon of freedom and opportunity for our nation.”
He continued, listing his priorities as future Senate President.
“We will defend the taxpayer and ensure every dollar is used wisely. We will break down barriers for job creators and innovators. We will protect the rights of parents and strengthen our schools. We will stand firmly with law enforcement to keep our communities safe. We will conserve Florida’s natural beauty so that it endures for generations,” he said. “These are not just policies, they are commitments.”
The celebration came one week after the Florida House announced that Rep. Sam Garrison, a Fleming Island Republican, would be its next speaker. Garrison will take over from sitting Speaker Danny Perez, who’s dominated headlines for asserting the House’s independence from the executive branch.
Boyd, who works in insurance and investment, was elected to the Senate in 2020 after serving in the House from 2010 to 2018. He is Florida State University graduate whose grandfather and uncle served in the Legislature as representatives of Manatee County. Unlike Boyd, they both served as Democrats.
During his time in the Legislature, Boyd sponsored a strict crackdown on retail theft — heartily signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 — and tougher penalties for Floridians who falsely report crime. He’s sponsored multiple bills dealing with property insurance.

(Photo courtesy of University of Northern Iowa)A University of Northern Iowa professor is suing the university, alleging administrators waged a coordinated campaign to falsely “frame” her for disability discrimination while subjecting her to gender-based discrimination.
In a newly filed federal lawsuit filed against UNI, Mary Catherine DeSoto, an author and a tenured professor at the school, states that her “life and career have been defined by sustained political activism and public advocacy, including raising concerns about administrative spending, resource allocation, and institutional waste.”
She alleges those positions have, at various times during her 24 years at the school, placed her “in sharp conflict with university administration.”
The lawsuit alleges that after “disturbing incidents in 2012,” regarded by some as “severe retaliation” her for activism, DeSoto felt compelled to enter an informal agreement with the university and curtail her criticism of wasteful spending.
In 2023, she resumed her advocacy when she agreed to serve on UNI’s budget committee and gave a presentation addressing what the lawsuit characterizes as “administrative bloat and threats to course offerings,” the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, UNI officials responded to the presentation by initiating a “renewed campaign of retaliation marked not only by defamatory attacks on her professionalism but also by grave procedural violations — including denial of her right to appeal, undisclosed ex parte communications with decision-makers, and the deliberate exclusion of exculpatory evidence from investigative reports.”
The lawsuit claims these “procedural abuses” were compounded by UNI’s “longstanding failure to address DeSoto’s Title IX complaints of discriminatory harassment by an administrator” at the school. The school then showed “unwavering institutional support” for the accused harasser, adding that this “entrenched pattern of institutional misconduct” inflicted profound harm on DeSoto’s career and well-being.
In addition to UNI itself, the lawsuit names as defendants UNI President Mark Nook; Provost and Executive President for Academic Affairs Jose Herrera; Dean of the College of Social & Behavioral Science Brenda Bass; Associate Provost Amy Nielsen; Adam Butler, the head of the Department of Psychology and DeSoto’s supervisor; Ann Bilder, legal counsel for UNI; Title IX Officer Leah Gutknecht; Assistant Dean of Students Tiffany Dodd; Deputy Title IX Coordinator Kaylee Michelsen; Brenda White, an investigator for UNI; and Kara Hughes, a senior “solutions specialist” at Grand River Solutions.
The university has yet to file a response to the allegations, and a university spokesperson on Tuesday declined to comment on the matter.
Lawsuit alleges ‘yelling rants’ by department head
DeSoto alleges that from 2010 through 2013, while serving as president of UNI’s United Faculty organization, she regularly voiced concerns that budget cuts were necessitated by excessive spending on administration and were degrading course offerings and damaging the overall education experience of UNI students.
According to the lawsuit, her activism led to news coverage and presentations to the Iowa Legislature on “wasteful spending,” after which UNI’s faculty issued a vote of no confidence against the school’s then-president, Benjamin Allen.
The lawsuit claims Allen then issued a public statement falsely accusing DeSoto of being anti-military, which led to her receiving hundreds of hate emails and fielding death threats. “For a period, DeSoto required university-provided security escorts to and from classes for her personal safety,” the lawsuit alleges. “Her car was vandalized, and the words ‘USA’ carved into the paint.”
In 2013, DeSoto advised the UNI administration she was formally backing away from her activism and criticism of the budget and she opted not to seek reelection as president of the United Faculty, according to the lawsuit.
Beginning in December 2016 and continuing through September of 2024, the lawsuit claims, DeSoto repeatedly sought assistance from the school’s Office of Civil Rights Compliance regarding Butler, her supervisor.
The lawsuit claims Butler openly criticized DeSoto for her then-recent marital separation and lectured her about her personal life, asserting that her place was at home with her husband who also worked at the school. “Butler’s harassment and lecturing continued after DeSoto eventually got divorced,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Butler typically “saved his yelling rants for female employees of the Psychology Department. On the rare occasion that he raised his voice at a male employee he would always quickly apologize.”
In 2017, DeSoto allegedly asked that her concerns about Butler be handled by UNI through a formal complaint process, but the school redirected her to a more informal process that didn’t involve a UNI investigation. According to the lawsuit, no formal investigation occurred until November 2024.
In 2023, the lawsuit claims, the school was facing potential budget shortfalls that would sharply reduce class offerings for students and so DeSoto provided a presentation on UNI’s budget to the faculty leadership.
“This presentation pointed out that UNI had cut faculty numbers by 34% since 2012 while the number of administration employees had actually increased by 6%,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that UNI leaders, who were monitoring her activity, then embarked on a “campaign of illegal conduct, all designed to drive DeSoto out of the university.”
DeSoto accused of discrimination
The lawsuit alleges the school’s leaders hatched a plan “to falsely frame DeSoto for disability discrimination with the intent to ultimately have DeSoto removed from the university.” According to the lawsuit, the discrimination allegation was based on a false assertion that DeSoto disliked students with disabilities and did not want to accommodate their needs with regard to testing.
The defendants, the lawsuit alleges, manipulated and misled a student “into thinking that a disability discrimination complaint was her only avenue to improve her grade” in DeSoto’s class.
The lawsuit alleges that while some of the specific allegations related to the charge of discrimination were either dismissed or resolved with a finding of “not guilty,” the evidence presented by the school disregarded facts in DeSoto’s favor.
After DeSoto complained about what she perceived as the “biased” nature of the investigation, the university hired Grand River Solutions to act as the decision-maker on the discrimination complaint.
In November 2024, UNI issued a decision finding DeSoto discriminated against the student. DeSoto appealed, and in January 2025, the school’s hired appeal officer vacated the decision and remanded the case back to Hughes, the decision-maker. The lawsuit claims Hughes then “made essentially same decision” as she had in November 2024.
In August 2025, with DeSoto’s second appeal still pending, UNI allegedly issued her “a letter of reprimand with major sanctions” that included a fine of $6,230, a requirement for mandatory training, a ban on serving on student committees, and restrictions on her internal communications.
The lawsuit claims the cumulative effect of UNI’s handling of the discrimination case and DeSoto’s complaints about Butler was “to shield Butler from scrutiny while subjecting DeSoto to a procedurally rigged process — harassing her, chilling her protected activity, and weaponizing the very procedures meant to ensure impartiality.”
According to the lawsuit, DeSoto is currently on medical leave due to severe work-related stress and her attempts to return to the workplace “have triggered overwhelming feelings of dread, avoidance, and physiological panic reactions.”
The lawsuit, originally filed in state court and moved this week to federal court, seeks damages for alleged violations of the federal Civil Rights Act, the Iowa Civil Rights Act, DeSoto’s First Amendment rights, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The lawsuit also seeks damages for an alleged breach of contract by UNI and for intentional infliction of emotional distress by Butler.

Ned Lamont to testify in the Kosta Diamantis trial, saying his testimony wouldn't be relevant.","A U.S. District Court judge ruled Tuesday that Gov. Ned Lamont does not have to testify in the ongoing criminal trial of Konstantinos Diamantis.
Diamantis’ attorney, Norm Pattis, filed a motion in early October seeking to add Lamont to the witness list.
Lamont was served a subpoena last week, and Attorney General William Tong’s office hired attorneys from the Hartford law firm Shipman and Goodwin to handle the matter.
They were prepared to file a motion to quash the subpoena as early as today, but Judge Stefon Underhill ruled from the bench that Lamont’s testimony wasn’t relevant to the charges against Diamantis.
Underhill held the hearing outside the presence of the jury. 
The judge asked Pattis to explain why the governor’s testimony would be relevant in the bribery and extortion case against Diamantis. 
Pattis explained that Lamont instructed Diamantis to bring school projects in on time and on budget. And he said those orders were what caused Diamantis to be so aggressive on the school projects. 
Throughout the trial, several witnesses testified about how aggressive and abrasive Diamantis was in the school construction field. One witness, Jack Butkus, said his team referred to Diamantis as “Napoleon.” And another witness called him “an arrogant prick.” 
But after Pattis was done explaining that rationale for calling the governor, the prosecution objected to Lamont being hauled into court and placed on the stand. 
The judge quickly agreed with the prosecution and ruled that Lamont’s testimony would not be relevant. In rendering that decision, Underhill pointed out that Diamantis is on trial for soliciting and accepting bribes, not being personally aggressive toward people. 
As court ended, Pattis said he didn’t understand the judge’s ruling and said it would likely be an appealable issue if the trial does not go Diamantis’ way.
Diamantis, the former the head of the Connecticut Office of School Construction Grants and Review, was charged last year with 22 federal counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. They alleged that he set up a pay-to-play scheme within Connecticut’s school construction office.
Federal prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case in the next few days, and Pattis had listed Lamont as a potential defense witness. 
During last week’s cross-examination of John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom Masonry, which won a number of school construction projects, Pattis asked Duffy if he was aware that Lamont and Diamantis had had private meetings during COVID during which the governor told Kosta to “get the school construction projects done quickly, anyway he could and to use Connecticut laborers.” 
Duffy testified he wasn’t aware of those meetings. Outside the courtroom, Pattis said he will ask Diamantis about those meetings with Lamont when Diamantis testifies later this week.
During his first term, Lamont promoted Diamantis to the position of deputy director of the state’s Office of Policy and Management. Diamantis held both positions during the COVID crisis.
But Lamont later fired Diamantis from that job in October 2021, after investigators subpoenaed the state for a long list of records related to Diamantis and several public building projects he oversaw.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_084-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

Two years after he moved to Vermont to lead Northfield’s police department, Chief Pierre Gomez has submitted his resignation, effective Nov. 1.
Gomez said he emailed his letter of resignation to the select board and the town manager Tuesday, just after noon.
Ongoing racial discrimination from some people and “their attempt to undermine the department since I was hired in 2023” are among reasons for Gomez leaving, he said in an interview.

He said he is unable to comment further “due to pending litigation.”
Select Board member Merry Shernock confirmed she heard from the chief Tuesday after he submitted the letter.
“This saddens me very much, but I have been sad about this for quite some time,” said Shernock, who has been the most vocal among board members in supporting Gomez at public meetings this year.   
“I was on the committee that hired Mr. Gomez and we had such high hopes. I think he did as well,” she wrote in an email Tuesday.
Northfield Town Manager Jeff Schulz and other members of the board did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Gomez, 58, was hired in September 2023 as chief of police in the Washington County town of about 5,900 — home to Norwich University — after former chief of police John Helfant retired amid controversy in May 2023. 
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont — he identifies as a Black Latino — Gomez has reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town.
Northfield residents packed a select board meeting in April to support him after Lynn Doney, a disgraced former selectman who worked as a deputy sheriff and EMT in Washington County, made a racist remark regarding Gomez wearing a hoodie on duty instead of wearing his uniform, “so he looks like a police chief and not a gangster off the street that’s just driving our cruisers around,” he said.
Doney was interrupted by selectboard member Shernock, who said she didn’t think Gomez looked like a gangster and that police officers don’t always have to be in uniform.
More than a dozen residents wore hoodies to a subsequent select board meeting in solidarity with Gomez, who was also present and wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt in the back of the room. 
In September, while on duty, Gomez was accosted by a resident – later identified as Gary Allen Smith – who, he said, “ranted and raved” at him using racist terms.
Originally from Pittsburg, Gomez moved to Vermont with more than two decades of experience after retiring as a detective in Philadelphia.
His decision to leave comes during Hispanic Heritage Month and after another leader of color in policing — Etan Nasreddin-Longo — was removed from the Vermont State Police’s Fair and Impartial Policing Committee last month. 
Gomez said he hopes to go back to Philadelphia in January, “where they celebrate diversity.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado sued three Trump immigration officials over arrests of immigrants in Colorado they say violate federal law.
The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court for Colorado, was brought on behalf of four people who were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including a 19-year-old University of Utah student, Caroline Dias Goncalves, who spent 15 days in the ICE detention center in Aurora after a traffic stop.
It alleges that immigration officials are arresting and detaining people without determining probable cause or flight risk — and making assumptions about their citizenship status based on accent and skin color — in order to meet the Trump administration’s high demand for arrests. The lawsuit asks a judge to stop that action.

“They are scrambling to fill arbitrary quotas set by the Administration, causing chaos and terror in neighborhoods throughout Colorado. This lawsuit seeks to enjoin Defendants’ ongoing pattern and practice of flouting federal law in connection with their mass immigration arrests in Colorado,” the lawsuit says.
The lawsuit was brought by ACLU of Colorado, Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray. It names Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons and Director of ICE’s Denver Field Office Robert Guadian as defendants.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Federal statute requires that federal immigration agents have probable cause to arrest a person they think is in the country illegally and deem the person a flight risk before they can obtain a warrant. The lawsuit alleges that those steps did not happen in the cases of the four detained people.
“Regardless of the color of our skin, the language we speak, or the neighborhoods we live and work in, the law protects us from these types of warrantless arrests,” Kenzo Kawanabe, partner at Olson Grimsley, said in a statement. “Each of us is protected from being rounded up and arrested in mass raids meant to meet arbitrary government quotas.”
ICE agents arrested Goncalves in June after being tipped off by a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who pulled her over for a traffic stop. That deputy had asked her about her immigration status and accent. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a complaint against that deputy for violating a state law that prohibits coordination between local law enforcement and ICE. The deputy resigned.
Refugio Ramirez Ovando, 43, another of the plaintiffs, was arrested on his way to work at a construction concrete company in Grand Junction in May. He was detained for three months, and an ICE agent later admitted they arrested him by mistake in an effort to find someone else.
A 36-year-old asylum seeker identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. was arrested during a February raid at an Aurora apartment complex. J.S.T. was leaving the complex to head to work when he was arrested and he was detained for four weeks.
A 32-year-old man identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. was waiting at a Colorado Springs nightclub to be a designated driver for a friend when he was arrested. He was detained for over six weeks.
The lawsuit describes similar experiences of people in Colorado who have been arrested and detained since Trump took office in January. It seeks class-action status.
“These agents indiscriminately arrested people, including people with pending immigration applications, no criminal history, established residences in the community, steady employment, family in the United States, and other community ties contradicting any purported flight risk. And agents targeted high-density locations like apartment complexes and nightclubs where many Latine people lived or gathered but conducted no individualized analysis about their status or likelihood of escape,” the lawsuit says.

Last week, DeVaughn Ward sent a letter to DOC Commissioner Angel Quiros asking that the department immediately suspend its contract with Bansley Law LLC of Old Saybrook, the firm hired by the state to administer the program. 
According to year-end reports from Bansley Law, the firm conducted only three professional visits and initiated four court cases in 2022-23, although it was contacted by 355 incarcerated people during that time. The following year, 2023-24, the firm held five professional visits and initiated two court cases but was contacted by 471 incarcerated people. 
Attorneys for the firm did not appear in court on behalf of incarcerated clients at any point during those years. 
Ward, the state’s correction ombuds, wrote in the letter to DOC officials that during his visits to prison facilities across the state, he saw almost no signs advertising the legal aid program or any kind of educational materials informing people that the program existed. 
“The extraordinary cost of these services compared to the negligible value it delivers is not merely striking — it is unacceptable,” he wrote. 
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, confirmed in an email last week that Quiros had received the letter. He wrote that the commissioner “is reviewing it with members of the agency’s legal team, and they are in the process of preparing a response.” 
According to the state’s most recent contract with Bansley Law, Connecticut is paying the firm $800,000 annually for services provided through the Inmate Legal Assistance Program, or ILAP. The firm has been contracted to administer the program since at least 2015. 
Walter Bansley IV, the owner of Bansley Law and director of the Inmate Legal Aid Program, told CT Mirror in an email that the program deals only with issues surrounding  “conditions of confinement,” and that the attorneys don’t represent inmates in legal actions or appear in court on their behalf. 
Instead, he said, the program’s role lies in “evaluating the needs and merit of a given claim and guiding [incarcerated individuals] in making and filing a claim.” That means most of the issues incarcerated people contact Bansley lawyers about land outside the terms of the firm’s contract with DOC, he said.
“Examples of this are actions against non-state actors, probate matters, criminal defense cases, etc,” Bansley wrote. “Unfortunately, when inmates have an issue, and we inform them that we cannot help because the issue is OUTSIDE THE SCOPE, they complain that we do not do anything.” 
Judging the firm’s performance based on things like court appearances, case filings and in-person visits “shows that Ombuds does not understand the purpose, intent, and scope of the ILAP program,” Bansley wrote. 
But several formerly incarcerated individuals, advocates and civil rights attorneys who spoke to CT Mirror agreed with Ward’s analysis, saying the Inmate Legal Aid Program was ineffective. 
Hassan Foster, who was incarcerated at Garner Correctional Institution and at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, said he had tried to contact the Inmate Legal Aid Program and that the lawyers had been unhelpful. He tried to file a civil case against a correctional officer, who, he said, punched him in the leg during a strip search, leaving bruises. 
Foster said the program attorney he spoke to told him there was nothing they could do. He said eventually he ended up filing a case with the help of another person who was incarcerated, who walked him through the steps. The case was settled with the state for $1,500.  
“Between a 1 to a 5, if I had to rate [Bansley]? Three,” said Foster, acknowledging that some of the paralegals were helpful and friendly. 
Bryan Jordan, who runs the nonprofit Guided By Purpose Initiative, said he contacted the Inmate Legal Aid Program several times while he was incarcerated regarding medical treatment in the prisons. He said the organization wasn’t responsive, didn’t come to visit him, didn’t explain relevant information and didn’t assist him with filling out forms. Like Foster, Jordan ended up filing his cases on his own. 
Asked about specific cases, Bansley said he was unable to comment without a release form signed by a notary public, citing attorney-client privilege. 
Attorneys who frequently work with incarcerated people also said the firm’s work was inadequate. 
“This program has proven inadequate and is not providing Connecticut individuals with their constitutional rights to access to the courts,” Alex Taubes, a civil rights attorney, said. 
Taubes added that getting access to legal materials has been a struggle for decades in Connecticut prisons, ever since a 1996 U.S. Supreme Court Case, Lewis v. Casey, in which the court ruled that an incarcerated person’s right to access the courts does not include the right to access a law library. 
Ward said in the letter that he had issued two subpoenas requesting documents from Bansley Law related to ILAP, which the firm refused to provide.
Bansley told CT Mirror that the documents Ward requested were either private under attorney-client privilege or “attorney work product,” or available through a Freedom of Information request. 
Ward has filed a motion in state Superior Court requesting that the court force Bansley Law to release the documents. The case is still ongoing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8111-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

Attorney General Nick Brown is proposing legislation, dubbed the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, that would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Other states, including California, Oregon and Illinois, already have similar laws.
The attorney general’s office notes workplace raids are increasing under President Donald Trump. But first, federal immigration agents usually tell employers they want to audit I-9 documents. 
“While the employer is given 72 hours to gather and produce their employees’ I-9 forms, employees often have no idea that their I-9 documents are being sent for review,” spokesperson Mike Faulk said. “This bill would give workers the opportunity to get their documentation in order, speak to an attorney, or make plans with their family if needed.”
Employers fill out I-9 forms for all of their employees. On the forms, workers attest to their legal status or authorization to work in the United States, and must provide documentation to that effect. 
Businesses can use the federal E-Verify system to compare an employee’s I-9 to government data to determine their eligibility to work. Many states require at least some employers to use E-Verify, but Washington isn’t one of them.
The proposed law would protect against raids like one earlier this year at a Bellingham roofing company. 
Immigration officials had reportedly asked Mt. Baker Roofing for I-9 documentation for its workers. Investigators said they found 56 employees had given false information. They used this information to get a judge to sign off on a warrant to search the company’s warehouse. In an early morning raid in April, federal agents arrested 37 people.
In May, agents arrested 17 workers at Eagle Beverage and Accessories Products in Kent, with the help of the Internal Revenue Service. Authorities attributed the arrests to employees presenting fraudulent work documents attesting to their immigration status.
The Biden administration had paused such large-scale workplace raids, and instead focused on holding employers accountable for hiring unauthorized workers. The Trump administration restarted the practice this year.
One of the Trump era’s largest workplace immigration operations came last month, when agents arrested nearly 500 workers, mostly South Korean citizens, at a car plant in Georgia. 
The executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network called Brown’s proposal “an important means of transparency for workers.”
“Immigrant communities who are essential to the economic and cultural vitality of our state are facing enormous threats because of the federal government’s ongoing mass detention and deportation agenda, while also struggling to meet basic needs,” Catalina Velasquez said in a statement.
On the other hand, state Rep. Jim Walsh, the chair of the Washington Republican Party, called it a “clear effort to undermine enforcement of federal immigration law.”
“It’s not clever. It’s not smart,” Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said in a text message Tuesday. “It’s decadent. And it puts the interests of illegal aliens ahead of the rights of American citizens.”
The attorney general’s office and state Department of Labor and Industries would enforce the policy.

Brown outlined his proposal in a Labor Day report last month on his office’s efforts to protect workers, and in a request for funding to Gov. Bob Ferguson. Lawmakers next year will approve a supplemental budget building on the two-year spending plan they passed this year. 
Brown wants about $400,000 to carry out the law if it is passed. Some of that money would go to community organizations like the solidarity network for outreach and education work.

Stephen Bryant, 44, pleaded guilty in 2008 to murder, burglary, arson, and assault and battery with the intent to kill, all during an eight-day crime spree in 2004.
His attorneys argued his mother’s alcohol use while pregnant with him made him incompetent for execution, a claim the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Tuesday.

The state Supreme Court typically issues death warrants on Fridays. If Bryant receives a warrant this Friday, his execution date would be set for Nov. 14. Inmates facing execution have the choice to die by lethal injection, electrocution or firing squad.
Between Oct. 5 and Oct. 13, 2004, during a series of burglaries, Bryant killed three people in Sumter County — Cliff Gainey, Willard Tietjen and Christopher Burgess. Bryant, 23 at the time, shot another person in Richland County, Clinton Brown, who survived.
Bryant received life sentences for killing Gainey and Burgess. Prosecutors pursued the death penalty for Tietjen’s murder.
According to court filings, Bryant killed the 62-year-old while robbing his Sumter home. After shooting Tietjen nine times, Bryant then ransacked his house looking for items to steal before smoking cigarettes and a cigar, then going on the computer.
When Tietjen’s wife and daughter called to check on him, Bryant answered Tietjen’s phone and told them he killed Tietjen.
Law enforcement found cigarette burns on Tietjen’s eyes and several notes, including writing on the wall that read, “victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” according to court filings.
Unless Bryant’s attorneys file another appeal, he will be the seventh inmate executed since the process resumed in September 2024. He is one of 24 people remaining on death row, including one housed in California.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

Civil rights groups say the legislation impedes the rights of young people to register to vote and have their ballots counted when using same-day registration during the early voting period.
Republicans who authored the bill claim it’s necessary to protect election security.
However, attorney Adrianne Spoto with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice said that young voters largely rely on same-day voter registration compared to other age groups, and SB 747 targets this preferred method of voting.
“Essentially, the bill made it so voters who use same-day registration can have their ballots discarded if a single verification mailer sent to them bounces back as undeliverable,” explained Spoto.
A simple postal error out of the voter’s control could easily cause a ballot not to be counted.
Jovita Lee, director of the North Carolina Black Alliance
“This is especially challenging for young voters in college dorms. These dorms often have complex, convoluted systems and addressing standards,” Spoto said during a Tuesday press briefing.
Although a federal judge ruled county boards of elections must reach out to voters before discarding ballots, the notice and cure process has not always proven to be effective, according to the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.
Dr. Jovita Lee, director of the North Carolina Black Alliance (NCBA), said SB 747 disproportionately impacts students attending North Carolina’s 11 historically black colleges and universities.
“Before Senate Bill 747, the Board of Elections would verify the addresses of same-day voters using various means. Now [voters] only get one letter and they may not know that their vote has been cancelled,” said Lee.
Expert analysis offered in a pre-trial brief indicates that young voters under the age of 26 overwhelmingly rely on same-day registration, making up between 30 and 40% of same-day registrants in a given election.
Jennifer Rubin, League of Women Voters of North Carolina
Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Kevin Quinn is also expected to testify that historical elections data from 2010 to 2025 shows young voters were disproportionately more likely to rely on a second verification mailer to save their registration than any other age group, with approximately 20,000 individuals verified by using a second mailer.
The League of Women Voters of North Carolina is also a plaintiff in the federal case.
“When young people learn to vote early in their careers, they stay voters,” explained Jennifer Rubin, president of the League.
The League is concerned that a voter can do everything correctly, only to have their voice and vote canceled out.
Rubin said same-day registration has been one of the best ways to ensure that every eligible voter is able to cast a ballot – benefiting not only young adults and college students who tend to move more often, but also those who have changed their name, or missed the registration deadline.
“Disenfranchising voters over a piece of returned mail undermines trust, fairness and the integrity of our elections,” said Rubin.
Provision blocked in 2024 elections could be in play in ‘26
U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder initially issued an injunction that prevented election officials from using the “undeliverable mail provision” in the  2024 election cycle.
Attorneys for Republican legislative leaders argued the voting rights groups failed to prove the same-day registration policies in 747 caused any specific harm, and that their complaints were “speculative, generalized grievances.”
But Schroeder wrote in that temporary order that “By failing to provide voters with notice and opportunity to be heard, section 163-82.6B(d) creates an unacceptable risk that eligible voters’ ballots will be erroneously removed and not counted.”
In July, Schroeder rejected a motion by lawmakers for summary judgement.
Now the case returns to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina Monday, with an outcome that could have implications for the 2026 midterms.
As the case is being heard in Winston-Salem, Republican legislators will be back at the General Assembly redrawing congressional district maps to give Republicans a further advantage in the U.S. House.
Spoto, the attorney for the Southern Coalition, said the mid-decade redistricting announced just this week speaks to a broader, disappointing trend to cut back on voting rights.
“Whether it’s a matter of shaping the districts in a way that’s designed to harm voters from having their views expressed, things like SB 747, putting up barriers to people having their votes counted fairly–these all speak to problems our legislature is putting into place. It’s the exact opposite of how a democratic system should be operating.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-Voting-votingstickers.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

(Photo by Rob Levine/Minnesota Reformer)President Donald Trump’s trade war is having devastating consequences for soybean farmers, and Gov. Tim Walz joined other national Democratic leaders on a call Tuesday to highlight the story of one Illinois farmer whose business model is under threat from tariffs and international retaliation.
“It’s going to take us years to get these markets back,” Walz said Tuesday, calling on Trump to walk back his tariffs. 
China is the world’s largest consumer of soybeans, and the biggest international buyer of American soy, historically importing around one-quarter of the soybeans grown in the U.S. But in the aftermath of the trade war during Trump’s first term, China has instead become dependent on Brazilian soybeans.
In response to taxes Trump levied on American imports from China, China slapped an extra tax of 20% on American soybeans — giving a major price advantage to Brazil and other countries in the market. 
China typically begins buying American soy in October, but with the tariffs in place, farmers are facing an uncertain outlook. 
The Trump administration is considering a multibillion dollar bailout for American soy farmers, similar to how his administration handled the first trade war.
But soy farmers have insisted that a check won’t make up for the lost marketing opportunities. 
“We don’t want a bailout. We want markets for our crops,” said John Bartman, a corn and soybean farmer in Illinois. 
Bartman is featured in a new Democratic political ad, part of a new ad campaign targeting red districts in the Midwest. 
Tuesday’s press call coincided with Trump’s meeting with Argentina’s President Javier Milei. Trump has promised a $20 billion bailout of Argentina’s economy — which stands to benefit many Trump administration allies — drawing even more ire from the soybean industry and some Republicans. 
Hours after Trump announced the bailout, Argentina sold 20 shiploads of soybeans to China, and leaders opted to waive an export tax that effectively lowered the cost of the beans.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, who sits on the House Committee on Agriculture, said on Tuesday’s call that Democrats should spend more time in rural communities discussing farm economy issues. 
“We also need to send the message to the president that these chaotic tariffs, this reckless approach, this whiplash that people are feeling, is having real consequences,” Davids said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/soybean_harvest_4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

(Via Terran Orbital)While Florida leads the nation in attracting and developing skilled workers, headwinds are approaching, according to Florida Commerce Secretary Alex Kelly.
Florida is now third in the nation in terms of total manufacturing companies, but only 10th in the number of manufacturing employees, at approximately 430,000. Since 2014, Florida has increased manufacturing employment by 23.3% and, in 2022, the average annual wage for manufacturing jobs was more than $74,000, according to the 2023 Florida Manufacturing Report.
Speaking before the House Careers and Workforce Subcommittee on Tuesday, Kelly discussed what he said was a “huge challenge” in getting young people interested in working in a skilled labor environment, saying a high salary isn’t always the driving factor.
Florida Department of Commerce Secretary Alex Kelly (Via his X page)
And he said that more than 50% of Florida’s manufacturing workforce is 45 years or older.
“Which is very disproportionately different than most of our other workforce sectors in Florida,” he said. “So, for all we’re doing, we’re just simply aging our retirements out of our manufacturing sector … faster than people coming into it.”
The nature of the state’s retiring workforce will remain constant until approximately 2035, Kelly said, when it will “arc back in the other direction. But that’s a 10-year challenge for us that will definitely require a lot of policymaking thought.”
That remark prompted state Rep. Rep. Allison Tant, D-Tallahassee, to ask the three members of the business community also appearing before the committee whether they were doing anything specifically to draw younger people into industry, specifically middle-school students, to avoid attrition in the manufacturing workforce before 2035.
Andy Norman, president and CEO of Lakeland’s GMF Steel, said it would take a combination of public and private efforts to encourage young people to enter trades and, specifically, construction management in the case of his company.
“We’re only graduating 250 students a year in the entire state of Florida in construction management out of five [state] universities,” he said, adding that the largest number is coming from the University of Florida, but only between 65 and 70 students.
He noted that as the largest producer of tonnage of structural steel in the state, “we’re having to train every single aspect of it because there’ s no formal training” at either a four-year or a technical institution for the skills required to work at his company.
Eddie Gonzalez Loumiet, chairman of the board at Ruvos, a Tallahassee IT services company, expressed concern about outdated computers in the K-12 school system, but said a real opportunity lies in teaching digital literacy to the parents of those students.
When Rick Scott led Florida as governor from 2011-2019, his administration offered hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives to recruit out-of-state businesses.
Committee Chairwoman Tiffany Esposito, R-Fort Myers, asked Kelly where he was philosophically when it comes to offering tax incentives to recruit businesses to Florida.
Kelly replied that the two biggest drivers for companies considering coming to Florida is the quality of the workforce and the physical location.
“No company is going to go somewhere in the time that we’re in if you don’t have the workforce and the site that can be a great host to that company,” he said.
He added that when a company that begins the conversation about moving to Florida by discussing tax incentives that’s an immediate “red flag” to his staff that perhaps that company isn’t seeking to stay long in the Sunshine State.

He announced Tuesday he was resigning due to health concerns. (Photo courtesy NM Senate GOP)A Republican state senator representing a Southeast New Mexico district announced Tuesday he was resigning immediately from his seat early in his first term, citing recent health concerns.
Sen. Nicolas Paul (R-Alamogordo) represented District 33, which contains parts of Chaves, Lincoln and Otero counties, beginning in January. 
“Serving the people of District 33 has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Paul said in a statement. “I’m deeply grateful to the citizens of Otero, Lincoln and Chaves Counties for their trust and support. Together, we’ve worked hard to make our communities stronger, and I will always remain committed to the success of the district and New Mexico.”
Paul did not respond to Source New Mexico’s phone call, and a Senate GOP spokesperson said Paul would not be commenting further about his departure. 
During the 60-day legislative session, Paul sponsored or co-sponsored 14 pieces of legislation, most of them regarding crime, gambling and border security. Two of the bills related to gambling were pocket-vetoed. One that he co-sponsored with Democrats regarding state support of infrastructure projects became law. 
Paul did not attend the recent special legislative session.

To represent District 33, he won a three-way Republican primary in the 2024 election before running unopposed in the general election.
Because Paul’s district spans three counties, commissions in all three counties will meet soon to send a list of one or more proposed replacements to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has the final say. 
Senate GOP spokesperson Brandon Harris told Source on Tuesday that that process “has already begun,” given the short amount of time between now and the 30-day legislative session that starts on Jan. 20. 
Paul served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Tax, Business and Transportation Committee. He also served on the interim Courts and Criminal Justice Committee, Republican members of which recently toured the state’s biggest immigration detention center in Chaparral.

BRATTLEBORO — Ask administrators at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital about a multimillion-dollar operating budget shortfall and they’ll point to everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs.
“We fully recognize that we are in a very bad financial condition,” one hospital official said at an Aug. 6 budget review hearing. “We need to increase cash and decrease our payables and receivables.”
Vermont health care regulators, for their part, cite a bigger problem: fiscal figures they say don’t add up.

READ MORE

“BMH has not accurately or completely answered many questions,” the state’s Green Mountain Care Board wrote in an Oct. 1 decision on hospital spending. “This missing, incomplete and inaccurate information makes it challenging to understand BMH’s current financial position.”
No one, for example, can pinpoint the exact sum of the shortfall attached to the $119 million annual budget that ended Sept. 30. At a Sept. 3 hearing, the board said hospital filings were projecting a deficit of $2.8 million and, at the same time, reporting a year-to-date loss of $10.8 million.
Regulators, expressing fears that “the hospital may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis,” have told Brattleboro leaders to resubmit “corrected and accurate” budget numbers or risk becoming the first Vermont health care facility to receive outside intervention under a new state law.
As administrators revise their math, the hospital’s more than 500 staffers and 45,000 residents in its service area are questioning both the budget and this month’s unexplained leave of absence of CEO Christopher Dougherty.
Dougherty has referred all inquiries to the hospital’s communications office, which isn’t elaborating “out of respect for Chris’s privacy,” it has emailed corporators. 
The hospital also is limiting comment on its finances, saying only that administrators are cooperating with regulators. But the extent of the challenge can be gleaned from Green Mountain Care Board records, reports and recordings full of red ink.
‘Significant financial challenges’
The hospital, one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers, hasn’t reported a positive operating margin since 2020, according to board figures. But regulators didn’t initially see that as a red flag, as Vermont’s 13 other community hospitals also faced budget problems during the Covid-19 pandemic and a subsequent boom in patients that drove up spending.
Brattleboro, which ranks eighth in the state for net patient revenue, isn’t as large as Burlington’s University of Vermont Medical Center, Rutland Regional Medical Center or Berlin’s Central Vermont Medical Center, all which can offer more profitable subspecialties. On the flip side, Brattleboro’s 61-bed count isn’t small enough to be one of the state’s eight “critical access hospitals” (up to 25 beds in a rural location) that qualify for federal support.
Brattleboro’s financial plight became public in May, when the hospital warned it had four months to find $4 million in reductions and new revenue to balance its budget by Sept. 30.
“Like rural hospitals here in Vermont and across the nation, BMH faces significant financial challenges that have been imposed on us in large measure by both the state and federal governments,” Dougherty wrote in the email to community supporters.
The not-for-profit pointed to its status as the state’s only Medicare dependent hospital, meaning at least 60% of its admissions are Medicare patients age 65 or older. Brattleboro’s Medicare reimbursements for professional services have declined by almost 3% annually, Dougherty wrote. At the same time, the hospital is paying $600,000 a month in Vermont health care provider taxes — charged to facilities statewide — to help fund Medicaid expenditures for people with limited incomes.
“While part of that money comes back to us,” Dougherty wrote of the provider taxes, “the state recently reduced the percentage of annual return to less than 10%.”
‘System inefficiencies’
State regulators see the numbers differently. In last year’s budget decision, they noted that Brattleboro Memorial Hospital’s low Medicare payment-to-cost ratio, clinical productivity data and higher-than-average wait times indicated “system inefficiencies” that could be reduced through better management of expenses.
Hospital administrators went on to launch a hiring freeze and let go of six administrators in hopes of lowering its staff count from 543 last spring to 513 this fall. The hospital also recently won selection to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Rural Community Hospital Demonstration project that helps with financial reimbursements. 
But during the state’s annual budget hearings in August, hospital administrators detailed an even longer list of troubles. Unpaid patient bills had risen as high as $50 million after the arrival of Covid-19 and a 2024 cyberattack on its electronic claims processor. And costs had increased for everything from a self-funded employee health benefit plan to salaries of travel nurses and other contract workers.
As for the future, administrators told the board the hospital could lose nearly $4 million a year if the federal government doesn’t extend a subsidy provided to Medicare-dependent and low-volume facilities. Another $700,000 is at risk annually if the hospital is dropped from a national drug pricing program called 340B that offers financial help. 
Administrators also are unsure about the impact of new U.S. tariffs and a coming switch from the OneCare Vermont accountable care organization, closing at the end of 2025, to another company.
In response, state regulators praised Brattleboro’s high scores in patient satisfaction before pointing out their own problems receiving budget data.
Asked to submit management salaries, for example, the hospital didn’t provide numbers but instead simply noted, “We were just recognized by the Lown Institute as the best hospital in Vermont for pay equity, which they measured using our CEO’s comp in comparison to a median (support) employee.”
‘Survival of the hospital’
After repeatedly requesting other facts and figures to no avail, regulators began to make noise.
“It’s not a surprise to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital that GMCB staff have been consistently concerned about the accuracy of information that’s been submitted,” Mark Hengstler, the regulators’ attorney, said at a recent hearing, underlining the board’s multiple inquiries.
“It is really hard to properly evaluate your budget when we just have discrepancies, inconsistencies and unanswered questions,“ added board member Jessica Holmes, a professor of health economics and public policy at Middlebury College. “I don’t think I’ve ever said that to a hospital in the 10 years that I’ve been doing this.”
According to the hospital, its two staffers charged with helping regulators had been busy addressing the shortfall.
“Our financial condition has really interfered with preparing and submitting the documentation,” Laura Bruno, the chief financial officer, told regulators in August. “I’ve been fully focused on the survival of the hospital.”
The board wasn’t swayed.
“I understand your financial condition and we’re very worried about it, and so we really need to ensure that the data that is submitted is accurate,” Holmes said in response. “Your regulator is asking you questions and it is your obligation to answer.”
The state reiterated that in its Oct. 1 budget ruling.
“Stated as directly as possible, we are deeply concerned about BMH’s solvency,” the board wrote. “We believe that its leadership must make big strides to adjust course.”
Since then, the hospital has announced Dougherty’s leave and the appointment of two new acting co-CEOs, orthopaedic surgeon Elizabeth McLarney and primary care physician Tony Blofson.
“While we do not yet have a budget resubmission date, we take the concerns in the budget order very seriously,” McLarney and Blofson said in a statement to VTDigger. “We are in the process of evaluating the hospital’s overall financial status and are making progress to secure an outside consultant to conduct a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the issues raised.”
“We will be working with the GMCB to address all questions,” the acting co-CEOs added, “and will continue to do so moving forward.”
The state, for its part, said it would review the hospital’s revised budget once submitted — no date has been stipulated — and publicize any follow-up hearings.
“This is an important hospital, one that we feel very strongly needs to be there for the community,” board Chair Owen Foster said at a recent meeting. “Some of the data may not seem that important on the hospital side, but we rely on this to make really important decisions. The data needs to be right.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) PERRY — JBS USA broke ground Tuesday on its “state of the art” sausage making facility and celebrated with city and state leaders a “turning point” for the Perry community. 
The roughly 110-acre site on the southeast side of Perry is slated to be operational a year from now and officials said the plant would add a second shift about six months later, to hit the full 500-job metric. 
JBS officials said Tuesday a portion of the sausage made at the facility will go to JBS’ recently purchased facility in Ankeny that will make ready-to-eat sausage and bacon. 
Rick Foster, president of JBS USA’s prepared foods division, said the Ankeny facility is scheduled to open partially in July and fully open when the Perry plant becomes operational.

JBS announced plans for the plant in May and was awarded a $12 million tax benefit from the Iowa Economic Development Authority board because nearly 60 jobs at the facility will offer salaries of $30 or higher per hour.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig welcomed JBS to the site and said the plant would add “tremendous value” to Iowa’s pork industry. He said the value-added products made at the facility are part of Iowa’s story of “long-term strength” in the agriculture industry. 
“From an Iowa farm to JBS Perry to a plate here in Iowa or around the world, this is how it works,” Naig said. “This is how Iowa communities grow even stronger because of investments like this.” 
The groundbreaking occurred a little more than a year after a Tyson Foods pork processing facility, which employed nearly 1,300 people, closed in town.

Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh said the plant and its associated benefits will bring jobs back to the community and help to boost the existing businesses in town. 
“JBS’ investment will bring a lot of opportunities to town, it will bring good jobs back to Perry so our residents don’t have a commute to work,” Cavanaugh said. “It will help us recover from last year’s setbacks.” 
Wesley Batista-Filho, CEO of JBS USA, said the company decided to build the facility from scratch, rather than converting an existing company, with the hopes that the factory will “be here 100 years from now.” 
Batista-Filho said the facility will produce 130 million pounds of sausage annually. According to Foster, that equates to roughly 200 million pounds of pork processed annually. 
Batista-Filho said the Ankeny facility, which the company announced in August it planned to buy, will help to “ramp up” the production in Perry. 
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn attended the groundbreaking and said the JBS facilities in Iowa are an example of “what good pork spending looks like.” 
“We’re going to keep doing the same thing right in Washington, D.C. to make Perry’s success a model that can be replicated across the country,” Nunn said. 
In July, around 200 employees of a JBS plant in Ottumwa were terminated and had their visas revoked following steps from the Trump administration to change protected status for Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan nationals. JBS officials said Tuesday they did not have an update on the situation in Ottumwa. 
Foster said he is not concerned about the ability to hire workers for the Perry facility, even with ongoing immigration policy changes. 
“We’ve got very good feedback from the Perry community about the workforce and they’re kind of hungry for these jobs to come to the market, so we feel very strongly about the workforce that we’ll be able to put together,” Foster said. 
Rachel Wacker, the executive director for the Greater Dallas County Development Alliance, said the plant opening was “more than an economic milestone” but a “statement” that Perry is a town worth investing in. 
Wacker said through the hardship of shuttered plants, which account for a significant portion of the city’s jobs, the community has remained strong.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)   A nationwide coalition of organizations serving domestic violence survivors in 14 states and the District of Columbia recently notched another victory in its lawsuit to block the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to groups that value diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI.)
A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday granted a preliminary injunction against the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD), halting grant policies directing grantee organizations to eliminate all DEI initiatives in their work or risk losing funding. 
U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose’s ruling favored the plaintiffs in a lawsuit led by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence that included five other Rhode Island-based nonprofits. The plaintiffs had argued the new funding terms would imperil women and transgender youth experiencing homelessness and other populations their organizations serve. 
In court filings, attorneys for both federal agencies countered that the organizations’ only harm from the grant restrictions was financial in nature and therefore should be addressed by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said DuBose’s decision “ensures that vital programs grounded in equity and compassion can continue uninterrupted.” 
“Domestic and sexual violence survivors, LGBTQI+ youth, and unhoused individuals deserve dignity and access to support without restrictions — it’s a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work,” the groups said. 
The other five Rhode Island organizations listed in the lawsuit include House of Hope Community Development Corporation, Community Care Alliance, Foster Forward, the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, and Haus of Codec.
The HHS grant policy, updated in April, prescribes that grantees “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” Such language was stripped from the agency’s grant policy ahead of a July 24 hearing where DuBose temporarily granted relief to the housing and domestic violence relief groups.
HUD grant eligibility documentation online still notes the Trump administration’s goal of “ending radical and wasteful Government DEI programs and preferencing.”
DuBose, a Biden appointee, said the terms imposed by HHS and HUD were “likely unconstitutionally vague” because the agencies “do not clearly identify and define the contours of what is prohibited” when applying for grant funding.
“The phrases ‘promote gender ideology’ and ‘promote elective abortion’ obscure meaning like Russian dolls stacked inside each other,” DuBose wrote. “The plaintiffs stand between a rock and a hard place, and surely such a high stakes dilemma constitutes irreparable harm in the eyes of this court.”
DuBose added that the agencies failed to provide any explanation for the new rules or consider how they would affect vulnerable populations.
“To date, the defendants have failed to achieve even this basic requirement,” she wrote.
DuBose’s injunction orders HHS and HUD to treat their conditions as “null and void” and inform employees of the court’s order within two business days.

An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. Rhode Island Current received an automated response after making an inquiry to HUD stating its public affairs office was “operating in a limited capacity” since the federal government shutdown began Oct. 1.
“Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch,” the email states.
The Rhode Island groups were joined by domestic violence prevention organizations in the District of Columbia and the following states: California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

(Photo via Roku)Roku, the smart TV company, has raised the eyebrows of Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who alleges the company sold children’s consumer data.
Uthmeier’s Office of Parental Rights is taking action against the tech company in the Collier County Circuit Court. Uthmeier opened that office in April in the interest of “putting our money where out mouth is.”
“We believe that Roku has taken, used, shared, and sold the personal, sensitive data of our consumers, namely, our kids, and that they’ve done so in violation of the Florida Digital Bill of Rights and the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act,” Uthmeier said in a video posted to his social media.
Uthmeier said he believes Roku has used and sold data “regarding online preferences and behaviors of kids, videos and images that they might use online, even their location.”
“This is wrong and it violates Florida’s commitment to parental rights,” Uthmeier said.
In a news release, Uthmeier’s office said Roku “collected, sold, and enabled reidentification of sensitive personal data — including viewing habits, voice recordings, and other information from children — without authorization or meaningful notice to Florida families.”
The company didn’t protect parental consent or effectively disclose privacy controls and opt-out tools, the attorney general said.
The AG’s civil enforcement action targets Roku and its Florida subsidiary for violations of the laws mentioned above. He seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief, and measures ensuring Roku provides clearer disclosures and “lawful parental-control mechanisms.”
“Roku knows that some of its users are children but has consciously decided not to implement industry-standard user profiles to identify which of its users are children. Roku buries its head in the sand so that it can continue processing and selling children’s valuable personal and sensitive data,” the attorney general alleges in his 25-page complaint.
Roku forms partnerships with third-party data brokers “in an effort to avoid complying with Florida law,” Uthmeier contends.
One of the data brokers is Kochava, “a data broker with a long history of privacy violations and public scrutiny,” he wrote.
The complaint alleges that Roku does not perform age verification and thus does not comply with the Florida statute, passed in 2023. The Digital Bill of Rights was designed to protect children and others from big tech, the Phoenix reported at the time.
According to Roku’s website, its devices are used by “millions of consumers” and the company cites a 2022 report that found it to be the No. 1 TV streaming platform in United States, Canada, and Mexico by hours streamed.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)A Lewis and Clark County District Court judge found Gov. Greg Gianforte has the authority and responsibility to investigate a complaint filed against Montana Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar — and Molnar has a “duty to cooperate in the investigation.”
In the order, Judge Mike Menahan denied a motion to stop the governor from acting on a complaint filed against Molnar that alleged he was interfering with an internal investigation and should be suspended from elected office.
In Montana, the governor has the authority to suspend a commissioner if the commissioner fails to perform their duties, as described in state law.
Last month, the judge temporarily blocked Gianforte from suspending Molnar, finding the complaint against him was invalid, and that voters in his district would lose representation if he was suspended.
PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder had filed the complaint with Gianforte, but Molnar alleged she did not follow agency policy in requesting the suspension, rendering her complaint unathorized.
Fielder made the complaint as chairperson of an internal Public Service Commission “response team” handling allegations of professional misconduct against Molnar. Fielder could not be immediately reached for comment early Tuesday afternoon.
Allegations against Molnar include that he was interfering with the investigation and engaged in sexual harassment, which included jokes or innuendo.
Molnar has denied interfering with the investigation. He earlier told the Daily Montanan he made a joke that he later was told had sexual innuendo, but he was not aware of any such reference.
PSC spokesperson Alana Lake said Tuesday she could not comment on the status of the investigation. Lake said Molnar had removed her role as the agency’s media contact, and she apologized for the inconvenience.
“I do not believe this (removal) is in line with our policies, so will be challenging this, but I don’t want to overstep until this is solidified,” Lake said in an email.
Molnar said Tuesday he has not been presented with results of the investigation but said he was told roughly one week ago that it would need to be redone. He said the court order appears to give governors the ability to suspend any commissioner based on an unsubstantiated complaint.
“This is a far-, far-, far-reaching case,” Molnar said.
A spokesperson for Gianforte could not be reached early Tuesday afternoon for comment on the status of the complaint to the governor. The Governor’s Office did not take a position on the court case.
In the motion to the court, Molnar alleged Fielder had failed to follow internal policies before filing the complaint, including that she obtain four affirmative votes by commissioners, and therefore, the complaint was invalid.
In the order Friday, Menahan said the court agrees “there are questions whether Fielder acted in violation of internal policy when she sent the complaint” to the governor.
However, the judge also said Molnar’s arguments that Fielder didn’t follow internal policies are not relevant to the governor’s authority to act on the complaint.
He said Montana law is simple and unambiguous.
“The governor has the authority to act when a complaint is presented to him or her,” said the order. “While Molnar argues that the governor’s review and suspension is triggered only upon the filing of a ‘valid’ complaint, the statute contains no such requirement.”
The judge also said the harms that Molnar outlined are either speculative or largely against others — the public. In this case, the judge said Molnar is not representing electors.
And the judge said a prerequisite for a preliminary injunction — in this case, to tie the hands of the governor — is that “the applicant” himself is likely to suffer harm.
The order acknowledged Molnar identified personal injuries too, but the judge said they are, at this point, “entirely speculative.”
“Any harm to Molnar would occur only if, following the governor’s investigation into the allegations in the complaint, he found good cause to suspend Molnar and acted to do so,” the judge wrote.
The judge said the four factors that determine whether a preliminary injunction is warranted all tipped in Fielder’s favor, and Molnar was unlikely to succeed on the merits.
In an email, lawyer Matthew Monforton, representing Molnar, said he and his client were disappointed with the ruling.
Molnar had alleged the attempt to suspend him comes out of his firm stance that NorthWestern Energy should be transparent and the Public Service Commission should not help it operate in the dark.
“Governor Gianforte and the big utilities are one step closer to completely hijacking the PSC from Montana voters,” Monforton said in an email.
PSC spokesperson Lake earlier said the allegations against Molnar are unrelated to NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility.
At a meeting in September, PSC staff had asked commissioners to not rescind the complaint filed with the Governor’s Office. Staff expressed support for Molnar’s experience and commitment but concern over his refusal to participate in the investigation.
Molnar took office in January 2025, but he earlier served on the PSC in 2007 when it denied the sale of NorthWestern to an Australian company, Babcock and Brown Infrastructure, and then saw Babcock and Brown file for bankruptcy.
NorthWestern recently announced a merger with Black Hills Corp, and it also has a major settlement pending with the Public Service Commission.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which ended the legal right to abortion. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s U.S. Senate primary is now teed up as a test for the future of the Democratic Party. 
With Gov. Janet Mills’ official campaign launch Tuesday, the Democratic primary field for Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins’ seat not only got more crowded but is primed for a battle between growing grassroots momentum and the establishment. 
Mills, who was scouted by and launched her campaign with the financial backing of national Democrats, will face a Democratic field of otherwise largely political newcomers. So far, most of the momentum has been building behind Graham Platner, an oysterman and military veteran from Sullivan who was scouted by unions and community groups. 
Platner’s campaign is centered around breaking away from the Democratic establishment. He says he’s running not just to become a senator but to build out a lasting structure for grassroots politics in the Pine Tree State.
“I have held over twenty town halls in every corner of Maine, from Rumford to Madawaska to Portland. Everywhere I hear the same thing: people are ready for change,” Platner said in a statement Tuesday. “They know the system is broken and they know that politicians who have been working in the system for years, like Susan Collins, are not going to fix it.”
He and many of the other Democratic challengers welcomed Mills into the race Tuesday, calling primaries an essential part of the democratic process. One dropped out, while another called Mills’ bid a mistake for the party, echoing an earlier critique made by independent Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed Platner.
“It’s disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run,” Sanders wrote on social media earlier this month. “We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.”
The Senate GOP’s top super PAC made a similar point. In a statement Tuesday, executive director Alex Latcham called the Maine Democratic primary “increasingly toxic.” 
“The only thing Mills has gotten right in her career is praising Senator Susan Collins’ effective and proven leadership,” Latcham wrote. “So while Democrats fight among themselves, Senator Collins will keep doing what she’s always done — delivering for Maine families.”
Collins did not respond to a request for comment about Mills entering the race nor Mills’ critique of Collins in her launch video as someone who has “forgotten their principles” and let bullies like President Donald Trump “have their way.” 
In Collins’ hometown, Platner brings his grassroots pitch to The County

Collins hasn’t officially announced she’s seeking reelection, though she’s told Maine Morning Star she intends to run and has already raised millions to support her campaign. ​​Maine Republicans have rejected the idea of forcing a primary on Collins, though there are two longshot Republican challengers.
A large Democratic primary field has some benefits for both voters and candidates, said Mark Brewer, chair of the political science department at the University of Maine. Voters have a bigger menu of options to choose from, while candidates get campaign experience before the general election, including debates.  
“That can be beneficial, especially, for inexperienced candidates,” Brewer said.
After Mills’ announcement Tuesday, another Democratic candidate Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide, called for debates in all 16 counties. 
“This campaign is about courage, accountability, and who has what it takes to defeat Susan Collins, defend our democracy, and deliver for working families,” Wood said in a statement. “I’m ready to make that case on the debate stage – and in every county across Maine.”
But there are also downsides. It can deplete resources — money, staff — for the general election. But Brewer sees a bigger downside in candidates from the same party beating each other up, exposing flaws that provide general election opponents hints on how to attack that candidate down the line. Research has shown that bitter primaries hurt high-profile candidates’ chances in general elections.
That’s top of mind for Keith Endy of Presque Isle, who attended a town hall Platner hosted in Caribou, Collins’ hometown, earlier this month. 
“I am concerned about that one, just because if she enters the race, you are gonna have basically the entire establishment against Graham,” Endy said of Mills. 
With Mills now officially in the race, Brewer sees the candidate pool essentially shrinking to two or three people. Even if other candidates don’t formally withdraw, he said, “she will take a lot of the oxygen out of the room.” 
So far, only Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, has officially suspended his campaign in light of Mills’ entrance. He also endorsed Mills. 
“I entered this race because I believe Washington needs more leaders who put people before politics and who will fight every day to make life better for Maine families,” Kleban said in a video announcing his campaign suspension. “While our message was right, the timing isn’t. Governor Mills is the right leader for this moment and is in the best position to win.”
No one else has formally withdrawn so far, though little-known Natasha Alcala of Madawaska said she’s considering quitting.
Before Mills’ official announcement, another Democratic candidate, David Evans, ​​an Army veteran and former Pentagon policy writer, entered the race on Oct. 1. He said he will stay in through the primary next June. 
“Janet Mills and I both care deeply about Maine,” Evans said on Tuesday. “I look forward to a primary focused on solutions, not divisions and on delivering real solutions at the national level.”
Tucker Favreau, an Army veteran who works in cybersecurity, said Mills’ decision to enter the race has only energized him to grow his campaign more. While he said Mainers deserve a pool of candidates to choose from in the primary, he thinks Mills’ campaign is a mistake. 
“She could have helped mentor multiple candidates throughout this race and helped Maine Democrats build a deep bench of candidates for multiple future races,” Favreau said. “Instead, she has chosen to run for a position which she would likely only be able to occupy for one term.”
Mills has already pledged to serve only one term in the U.S. Senate if elected, according to an interview with the Boston Globe. When Collins, who is approaching 30 years in Congress, was first elected in 1996, she had pledged to not serve more than two terms.

DemasTwo bills addressing earmark transparency rules, adopted by the Legislature during this year’s budget battle, are moving closer to becoming state law.
Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday adopted changes to House Bill 4420 and Senate Bill 596 before the committee reported both bills to the Senate floor. 
The upper chamber’s bill, if passed, will next move to the House for final consideration and concurrence. Members of the House already passed their portion of the legislation, and Senate passage would position the legislation to move next to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
House Bill 4420 and Senate Bill 596 are tie-barred, so they need to pass and be signed by Whitmer in tandem to become law.
The bipartisan, bicameral effort appears to be on a fast track, however, after the new rules were a key piece of the bargain when lawmakers agreed to a budget deal earlier this month. 
Both bills are based on that framework, which the House adopted as new rules in the early stages of the budget process. The lower chamber dictated that any earmark proposed in its spending plan would have to be made public, with the sponsoring legislator’s name attached, and that only earmarks designated to non-profit organizations would make the final cut. Many of the proposed earmarks, listed on a public website for scrutiny’s sake, did not end up in the final proposal put forward by the House in August.
In the months leading up to final negotiations on the budget, House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) implored his Senate colleagues to do the same. At the same time, state Rep. Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) introduced House Bill 4420 in May. It was passed unanimously in the House on May 4.
The Senate eventually joined the party as earmark transparency for both chambers became part of the negotiations. On the eve of its vote to adopt a conference budget earlier this month, and days after the new fiscal year began, the Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing to disclose its earmarks before they became part of the final package.
With that battle behind them, both chambers appear eager to reform the earmark process and make the new rules set in stone for the entire Legislature. Since the House already passed its version of the proposal, the Senate is now tasked with keeping the momentum.
Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Oct. 8 met to discuss Senate Bill 596 but did not take any action.
Michigan Senate appropriators hold first hearing on new earmark rules in wake of budget fight

On Tuesday, senators held further discussions on their version and also House Bill 4420, featuring testimony from Kunse, its sponsor.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), the committee’s chair, said the adopted changes reflect conversations between the House and Senate – not just in the last budget cycle and directly afterward, but over the course of the past three years.
The new version of Senate Bill 596 gives a clearer definition for earmarks to help compare them against regular government spending. There is also a new disclosure and disbursement process baked into the substitute bill including rules that prohibit earmarks going to for-profit entities and new requirements for eligible non-profit organizations. For the latter, the non-profits slated to receive funding must have a long history in Michigan of stable operations. 
A requirement for posting the proposed earmarks to each chamber’s legislative website are included in the changes, as well as a new mandate for hearings on the earmarks before the are proposed in either chamber’s budget plans.
Similar changes were made to House Bill 4220. Kunse said the proposals are fairly straightforward. The House bill will dictate the form and manner for submitting the earmarks and the Senate bill will focus on the overarching rules related to what is eligible or not.
Some questions from legislators dealt with why for-profit companies were excluded and if there was a deadline to turn in new earmark requests, given that the Legislature has a June 1 statutory deadline – which is not often enforced – for both chambers to pass their spending plans.
Anthony said there were far more transparency mechanisms with non-profits that make the money and the companies easier to track. A representative from Kunse’s office also said the timing piece was still a topic of discussion.
Both bills were ultimately reported and moved to the Senate floor.

Tick found on a dog in Franklin County has implications for animal and human health.,"Kansas health and agriculture officials say Asian longhorned tick — an exotic, invasive species with cattle and human health implications — has been identified for the first time in Kansas. The tick was tested after taken from a dog in Franklin County. (Kansas State University)
TOPEKA — Kansas officials issued a public notice after testing confirmed the invasive Asian longhorned tick was identified in Franklin County and posed an emerging threat to animal and human health.
It was the first known detection in Kansas of the prolific tick, which afflicts wildlife, pets and livestock. The tick is a hazard for cattle as it infects red and white blood cells and causes weakness, fever, loss of appetite or death.
The reddish-brown tick is known to carry a variety of pathogens and has proven efficient at establishing populations in new areas due to its ability to reproduce without mating. In Asia, the tick has transmitted a virus causing human hemorrhagic fever.
“Right now, our concern is mainly for cattle,” said Gregg Hanzlicek, a Kansas State University professor and associate director of the Kansas Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. “But like any tick, people should take precautions: wear long sleeves, use insect repellent and check for ticks after being in grassy or wooded areas.”
He said the report didn’t mean Kansas had a widespread population of the tick, but the public should be aware of the insect and diseases they carry.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said laboratory analysis identified the tick after it was found on a dog in Franklin County.
“We’re still learning about this tick and the ecologic role that it currently plays and may play in the future in terms of disease transmission to humans,” said Erin Petro, KDHE’s public health veterinarian. “While the human health implications are uncertain, this tick has serious implications for animal health.”
The Asian longhorned tick was initially found in 2017 in New Jersey, then spread westward to more than 20 states. Kansas was the most recent documented location.
Kansas animal health commissioner Justin Smith, of the Kansas Department of Agriculture, said the agency had monitored migration of the tick since it was confirmed in neighboring states.
“Now that it has been identified in Kansas, we have been in contact with accredited veterinarians across the state to remind them to be alert for this tick and to ensure they understand the risks,” Smith said.

The Pride Center of Vermont is keeping its support hotline active amid its recent closure, in partnership with the Vermont Network’s Steps to End Domestic Violence.
Operating since 1999, the longtime nonprofit announced a pause in services Friday due to a funding shortfall, and the board issued a call to raise approximately $350,000 needed to restore operations.
In the meantime, the center’s support line remains active and will redirect to the Steps to End Domestic Violence’s hotline, according to Monica Allard, co-chair of the Pride Center’s Board of Directors.

When she heard about the closure Friday, Nicole Kubon, executive director of Steps, said she immediately called the hotline’s director.
“They are one of our sister organizations through the Vermont Network — a statewide coalition that supports domestic and sexual violence survivor organizations,” she said. “I said, ‘What can we do to help?’ And we just made a plan.”
Operating for at least three decades, the StepsVT hotline at 802-658-1996 runs 24/7 and offers victims of domestic violence a free, confidential pathway to resources and referrals. Last year, the organization received about 2,800 calls or about 54 calls each week, according to Kubon.
The SafeSpace Anti-Violence Program at the Pride Center is a confidential phone help line at 802-863-0003 and secure chat online for LGBTQ+ Vermonters, or in Spanish on WhatsApp at 802-860-7812, for those who have experienced violence, abuse, bias, hate and discrimination. Advocates are available for calls or chats between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Fridays, according to the website.
The partnership effectively makes the hotline available 24/7. Both hotlines remain active, Allard said, so it doesn’t matter which number callers use.
Created with grant funding as an independent nonprofit in the early 2000s, SafeSpace merged with the Pride Center in 2007. It currently consists of a full-time director, a full-time advocate and a part-time advocate, according to Allard.
The staff, who were laid off Friday, will be paid in full for time worked, as well as up to two weeks of accrued time off, and receive health benefits until at least the end of the month, the board announced Monday.
“We recognize that this does not provide enough support for some staff and are exploring additional ways to reduce the harm of this sudden crisis,” the board’s latest statement reads. “This includes, but is not limited to, providing free access to financial planning assistance and job search assistance, while simultaneously acknowledging and amplifying staffs’ independent fundraising efforts.”
While the closure of the Pride Center leaves a major hole in services for LGBTQ+ people, Kubon said she is cautiously hopeful that other programs across the state can rally to provide that support.
“We certainly already work with LGBTQ+ survivors, and we’ve had a strong partnership with Pride Center and Safe Space for many years,” she said.
In the meantime, the board is assessing the organization’s finances to figure out what went wrong and to create a plan to move forward. 
“The outpouring of support has given us hope that the Center can be relaunched in the future with stronger accountability, governance and sustainability from the ground up,” the board’s statement reads. It also directs clients to partner organizations such as Vermont Cares, Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, Howard Center Substance Use & Recovery Support, Pathways Mental Health Urgent Care and the LBGTQ+ National Hotline.
 “We expect to have more information in the coming days to share about our partnership with the Vermont Network,” Allard said Monday.

Whitehouse links rising insurance costs to climate change at Raleigh roundtable,Christine Zhu,,,,,https://ncnewsline.com/2025/10/14/us-sen-whitehouse-links-rising-insurance-costs-to-climate-change-in-raleigh-roundtable/,Whitehouse has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.,"U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center in Raleigh on Oct. 14, 2025. (Christine Zhu/NC Newsline) 






	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat representing Rhode Island, held a roundtable in Raleigh on Tuesday to address climate change driving up insurance costs.
Speaking at the Walnut Creek Wetlands Center, Whitehouse joined U.S. Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-02), the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and Partners for Environmental Justice to address concerns from local experts, community leaders and residents.
Whitehouse is in his fourth term in the Senate. He has served as the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works since January 2025.
Whitehouse said his home state of Rhode Island faces some of the same environmental challenges as North Carolina. Rhode Island is subject to rain bursts — sudden amounts of precipitation in a short period of time — that can flood rivers and overwhelm sewage treatment facilities. The Ocean State also has rising sea levels, coastal storms, and erosion.
“Those are familiar topics to you here in North Carolina – upland river flooding from rain bursts and coastal erosion and storms tearing away at your coastal communities,” Whitehouse said.
Flooding, storm water, and storm control are familiar issues to Ross’s constituents in the second congressional district, she said, but they are less common in other parts of the state.
She referenced Hurricane Helene sweeping through western North Carolina last year and sending floodwaters through the mountainous terrain at an unprecedented level.
“It is a new [issue] to the North Carolina mountains and to many other areas in this country that are feeling the effects of climate change that have been spreading and worsening over time,” Ross said.
This raises costs for homeowners insurance, according to Whitehouse. He talked about insurance companies deeming properties too risky due to concerns with climate change, which then leads to increased rates for families.
A poll found that 92% of voters in Texas are worried about the costs of their home insurance rising due to severe weather like hurricanes and flooding, Whitehouse said, referencing a roundtable he held in Houston in August.
“This is actually everywhere, and it opens a new era of a climate conversation that will give us the political power to solve the problem before it gets devastatingly worse,” he said.
Dan Crawford, senior director of public affairs at the NCLCV, said North Carolina is on the front lines of this conversation. He said the state now has the third highest rate of property insurance policy cancellations in the country.
In some coastal counties, more than one in 10 homeowners lost their coverage in 2023, he said.
“The message is clear: You can’t solve the insurance crisis without also addressing the climate crisis,” Crawford said. “Rising risk means rising cost, and unless we take action to make our communities more resilient and reduce the pollution driving these disasters, North Carolinians will continue to pay that price.”
State Commissioner of Insurance Mike Causey didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue.
Community members at the roundtable shared stories of losing a business in Chapel Hill due to flooding and neighborhoods being destroyed from Tropical Storm Chantal in July.
Others expressed concerns over policy, especially with cuts to resources like the National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the National Flood Insurance Program.
Whitehouse said the NFIP “isn’t sound or fair now” and needs restructuring. Improvements should include better mapping, allowing people to know when they’re really at risk, and options for people to be able to get assistance to relocate before they have to rebuild their homes, he said.
“The whole program is failing right now, and so a very significant redo is required, but transparency and consumer options are two of the key pieces to make it right,” he told NC Newsline.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4255-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-14 16:58:47.236663

Causó una polémica entre activistas conservadores y religiosos, quienes afirmaron que permitiría a los adultos traficar menores.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
El gobernador Gavin Newsom firmó el domingo un proyecto de ley que permite ampliar la lista de   familiares que pueden asumir el cuidado de los niños si sus padres son deportados, una medida que había provocado una tormenta de críticas conservadoras.
El Proyecto de Ley 495 también prohibirá a los proveedores de guarderías recopilar información de inmigración sobre un niño o sus padres, y permitirá a los padres nominar a un guardián legal temporal para su hijo.
 “Queremos dejar constancia de que apoyamos a nuestras familias y su derecho a mantener segura su información privada, mantener los derechos de los padres y ayudar a las familias a prepararse en caso de emergencias”, dijo Newsom en un comunicado de prensa.
Esta fue una de varias medidas que la legislatura, dominada por los demócratas, impulsó este año en respuesta a la agresiva represión de las deportaciones de la administración Trump en Los Ángeles y en toda California. Newsom firmó varios proyectos de ley —que prohíben a los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) usar mascarillas y exigen que las escuelas y los hospitales exijan órdenes judiciales cuando los agentes se presenten— en una ceremonia celebrada en Los Ángeles el mes pasado.
Newsom dejó la Ley 495 sin decidir durante semanas, lo que desencadenó una oleada de activismo por parte de grupos defensores de los derechos de los inmigrantes para conseguir su firma ante la intensa oposición de los activistas conservadores. El gobernador anunció su decisión un día antes de la fecha límite para firmar o vetar los más de 800 proyectos de ley que los legisladores le enviaron el mes pasado.
El aspecto más controvertido del proyecto de ley se refiere a un formulario poco conocido y de décadas de antigüedad llamado declaración jurada de autorización del cuidador. Los familiares de un niño cuyos padres no están presentes, y con quienes vive el niño, pueden certificar ser su guardián; esta designación permite al adulto matricular al niño en la escuela, llevarlo al médico y dar su consentimiento para recibir atención médica y dental.
La nueva ley ampliará la posibilidad de  quién puede ser considerado como guardián, pasando de las definiciones más tradicionales de parientes a cualquier adulto de la familia que tenga parentesco consanguíneo, adoptivo o de ‘afinidad dentro del quinto grado’, lo que incluye a personas como tías abuelas o primos. Los padres pueden cancelar la designación de guardián, que es un acuerdo temporal y no otorga la custodia a esa persona.
 Los defensores afirmaron que los padres en riesgo de deportación deberían poder elegir a alguien de confianza para cuidar a sus hijos si el ICE los detiene. Ampliar la elegibilidad para el formulario de cuidadores, señalaron, ofrece a los padres inmigrantes más opciones, ya que, aunque no tengan familiares cercanos en el país, se benefician de fuertes vínculos con familiares o redes comunitarias informales.
 La legislación fue respaldada por grupos de derechos de los inmigrantes y defensores de los niños, como la Alianza para los Derechos de los Niños y First 5 California.
 “Presenté este proyecto de ley para que los niños no tengan que preguntarse qué les pasará si sus padres no pueden recogerlos de la escuela”, dijo la autora del proyecto de ley, la asambleísta Celeste Rodríguez , demócrata de Arleta, en una conferencia de prensa reciente. 
 Los críticos afirman que desconocidos podrían obtener la custodia
 Pero los republicanos, la derecha religiosa y los activistas en defensa de los derechos de los padres argumentaron que el proyecto de ley pondría en peligro a los niños.
Afirmaron que permitiría a desconocidos firmar la declaración jurada y reclamar al niño bajo su cuidado. Cientos de opositores acudieron al capitolio en Sacramento en autobuses para manifestarse contra la legislación, organizada por el pastor Jack Hibbs, de la megaiglesia Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, quien la calificó como “el proyecto de ley más peligroso que hemos visto”. Parte de la reacción negativa se debió a afirmaciones falsas de que el proyecto de ley permitiría a desconocidos obtener la custodia de niños con quienes no tienen parentesco.
 El asambleísta Carl DeMaio, republicano de San Diego, calificó la legislación como “el sueño de un traficante de personas”.
 En un correo electrónico, Greg Burton, vicepresidente del Consejo de Familia de California, cuestionó el hecho de que los padres podrían no estar presentes cuando se firma el formulario de declaración jurada.
 “¿Qué son los derechos parentales?”, escribió. “Estos derechos no sirven de nada si otra persona puede reclamarlos simplemente firmando un formulario”.
 Durante el verano, Rodríguez limitó la legislación para excluir a los “miembros de la familia extendida no emparentados”, pero no fue suficiente para calmar la controversia. La legislación se aprobó siguiendo las directrices del partido.
En comparación con una legislatura bastante progresista, el gobernador se ha posicionado a menudo como una fuerza moderadora en cuestiones de custodia y protección infantil, lo que suele movilizar a activistas conservadores y poner a los demócratas californianos a la defensiva. En 2023, vetó un proyecto de ley que habría obligado a los jueces de los tribunales de familia a considerar el apoyo de los padres a la transición de género de un menor en las disputas por la custodia.
 En una conferencia de prensa la semana pasada en la que los activistas instaron a Newsom a firmar el proyecto de ley, Angélica Salas, directora ejecutiva de la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos de los Inmigrantes de Los Ángeles, pidió al gobernador “que no escuche las mentiras, que no escuche todas las demás cosas que se dicen sobre este proyecto de ley”.
 Al anunciar su decisión, Newsom reconoció discretamente la controversia en un comunicado de prensa. Incluyó declaraciones que, según él, “corrigen el expediente” sobre las tergiversaciones y afirmó que la nueva ley no modifica el hecho de que los derechos parentales y las tutelas legales deben ser decididos por los jueces de los tribunales de familia.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020825_Duran-Family_JAJ_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit organization trying to connect entrepreneurs with investors and other resources across the state.,"Mississippi has bemoaned its lack of technology startups and venture capital since the first dot-com boom in the mid 1990s. 
Innovate Mississippi believes it might have a solution. It is providing funding and training to seven Mississippi tech startups through a 12-week program.
Alex Bucklew and Johnathan McAdory had an idea for a product that would find the best price for prescription drugs by aggregating discounts from a variety of sources. Their company, SimpleScript, is their first try at starting a business. For Bucklew and McAdory, Innovate Mississippi’s accelerator has taught them how to grow their business. 
 ”Especially something that’s scalable to the level (SimpleScript) is, it can be difficult to figure out what to do next. We needed some counsel on how to get from point A to point B.” said Bucklew. “From working with CoBuilders we will be ready to get funding.”
Mississippi has a nascent tech scene and state leaders have struggled with how to grow it. Innovate Mississippi is a nonprofit organization trying to connect entrepreneurs with investors and other resources across the state.
“With  3 million people in Mississippi, we’ve gotta do a lot of work just to find the business that needs the mentor three hours away, that needs the accounting person,” said Tony Jeff, the CEO and president of Innovate. “We connect those dots.”
Jeff says that without this connection, founders would turn to other states for funding and resources. 
CoBuilders, Innovate’s 12-week startup accelerator, mentors and trains Mississippi entrepreneurs on how to get their company and product ready to show to investors. Innovate, which is funded through a mix of public and private money, also invests $25,000 into each company.
This year’s cohort of seven companies has been refining its products to pitch to investors on Nov. 11. On pitch day, they’ll be looking to raise upwards of $100,000 each. Unlike other small businesses, startups are focused on rapid growth and capturing a large share of a market. 
To support this they usually rely on raising money from outside investors. In the early stages of a startup, companies often look to “angel investors,” wealthy individuals or groups that invest a small amount in a company. 
Jeff said it’s not enough for founders to have a polished pitch, they need to have researched their competitors and received feedback from users.
Leta Palmiter’s company, Vertical Take-Off Reading, is currently in its third pilot round and has over 130 students using it.

The software she created with co-founder Ben Stasa, measures students’ oral reading skills. As a speech therapist and executive director of a nonprofit that serves dyslexic students, Palmiter saw students needed one-on-one help with reading that teachers just didn’t have the time for. She looked for a tool to help her measure her students’ ability to read out loud but couldn’t find anything. So she decided to do it herself.
Vertical’s program can be used in a classroom or at home on any device with a microphone. A child reads out loud while the app records it then creates a report for the teacher to measure the student’s progress.

Reading out loud helps with comprehension and is especially important for students with dyslexia. Palmiter says that Vertical is designed to complement teaching, not replace it.
“ We know that it’s doing a great job measuring that accuracy at that sound level and that kind of data will drive instruction,” said Palmiter.
She met Stasa, a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Southern Mississippi, who was tackling the same problem. Palmiter said that working together helped bring the product to market. 
Mississippi’s colleges are playing an active role in growing the startup pipeline, funding research and fostering new ideas. Innovate works with universities to host pitch competitions and connect to founders.
“ There’s a lot of resources that the schools and universities help support tech entrepreneurs,” said Ricky Romanek founder of ClaimTra,  a healthcare analytics tool for hospitals and clinics to recover insurance claims.
Jeff says that students regularly tell him that they plan on leaving Mississippi because it lacks good job opportunities for them. While it’s a small slice of the economy, Jeff thinks the tech sector could play a role in addressing Mississippi’s brain drain problem.
“ There are a slice of Mississippians that these are the best and most exciting ways for them to stay here, be gainfully employed, and even move people here,” said Jeff. 
It can be difficult finding the right companies for the accelerator. They need to be innovative companies, often in the tech sector, that are early in development and have high growth potential.
“It is very obvious we have more money chasing deals than we have deals. So we’ve got to get everything we can to make every startup qualified for that money,” said Jeff. That’s where Innovate comes in, nurturing home-grown companies and attracting new companies to Mississippi.
Romanek has brought Innovate “ a couple other crazy ideas” before and is excited to contribute to Mississippi’s tech industry.
Romanek said: “ I think there’s a huge startup potential in Mississippi that’s untapped. There’s a lot of great ideas. I don’t think they’re aware of all the resources that are available.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09141648/Innovate-Mississippi-event-2.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

With a new initiative called the Utah Promise, the school is set to cover tuition and mandatory fees for up to four years of full-time enrollment starting in fall 2026 with scholarships and grants. 
The program will be available for undergraduate students who are Utah residents and whose household income and assets are each less than $100,000 annually. The effort has been designed to expand access to higher education across the state, according to a news release from the university.

“This is a transformative step for the University of Utah,” Taylor Randall, University of Utah president said in a statement. “No student should have to choose between pursuing a college education and their family’s financial security. Utah Promise ensures that higher education is within reach for thousands of talented students across our state.” 
To qualify for the program, Utah students must be first-time, first-year undergraduate students who graduated from high school with a 3.5 or higher unweighted GPA. Eligible students must also apply for admission by the University of Utah’s Dec. 1 priority deadline and complete their Free Application for Federal Student Aid, also known as FAFSA, by Feb. 1.
Students will remain eligible as long as they file the FAFSA form every year and their families maintain their qualifying income and assets. Recipients must also complete full-time course loads every semester and keep a cumulative 3.5 GPA or higher.
The program also adds to another effort the university is testing, guaranteeing admission to the state’s highest performing high school students in certain school districts. It was estimated that about 5,000 students would qualify for that initiative. It also joins other initiatives to simplify and streamline the school’s merit scholarship process, the university said.

As trust in higher education, according to a Gallup poll, recovers from a 2023 and 2024 low, and the Utah Legislature explores ways to reshape the public higher education system to accommodate programs that will launch students’ careers into a trade quicker, the University of Utah also witnessed historic enrollment and completion numbers this year.
This fall, the university had the largest incoming class in its 175-history, the U. said in a news release — 6,513 first-year students and 1,497 new transfer students.
Enrollment in the university has grown for the last six years. It increased almost 8% last year and 31% since 2020, according to the U. The most popular major is business.
The university also awarded the largest number of degrees in its history during the 2024-2025 academic year. About half of them were in STEM disciplines and 80% in what the Utah Department of Workforce Services identified to be high-demand fields.
“Enrollment growth only matters when it leads to student success,” Paul Kohn, senior vice provost for strategic enrollment and student success, said in a statement. “We’re investing in every stage of the student journey — from access and affordability to academic support and career readiness — to help students reach graduation in a timely and meaningful way.”

Roberts was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in late September.
In the weeks since his arrest, it has been confirmed Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024 — and reporting has found the Guyana native had falsified parts of his resume and credentials in addition to not disclosing his immigration status or criminal history during the Des Moines hiring process.

The Associated Press also reported that three months after he was hired, Roberts had asked the Des Moines school board for emergency approval of $116,000 in contracts for “culturally responsive coaching” that included a contract with Lively Paradox, a company that he was affiliated with as a consultant and speaker.
Finance officials warned Roberts that the contract with Lively Paradox requested in September 2023 would be a conflict of interest, and the superintendent canceled the request. But Lively Paradox was paid $6,476 by DMPS for consulting and travel expenses in December 2023 for a school board retreat, records show, an expense that was not flagged as a conflict of interest by the board or district staff.
This contracting issue, alongside other reports related to Roberts’ hiring and service at DMPS, are subjects that could warrant investigation, Sand told reporters at a news conference.
“After reading those reports, yeah, we have concerns,” Sand said. “We are already conducting two other reviews of spending by superintendents and other districts in the state. But again, the law says we can’t do this until we have a qualifying request. Just because the word ‘auditor’ is in the name doesn’t mean that we can jump out and audit any taxpayer, for example. We follow the law first. We want to know the facts, but we want to make sure that we’re doing things correctly.”
The letter sent by the three senators called for Sand to “take the time to do the job and help both lawmakers and Iowans as we continue to deal with the consequences of Roberts’ deceptions” and perform an audit of the school district. But Sand said his office cannot begin an audit of DMPS on this request. It must be requested by a Des Moines school board member, DMPS staff, or through a petition with 100 signatures from people living within the district.
Sand said at the time of the news conference, his office had not received a qualifying request to audit DMPS from a valid party. State law would have to change in order to allow his office to accept the state lawmakers’ request, he said, but added, “I don’t think that that’s a good idea.”
“We have avenues that are appropriate and then work right,” Sand said. “Anyone who’s a DMPS employee right now can send an email to info@aos.iowa.gov from their personal email, show us that they’re an employee of Des Moines public schools, and that is enough for us to initiate and audit.”
The auditor, the only Democrat to hold statewide elected office and who is running for governor in 2026, said the state legislators’ letter was “partisan politics.” He said all three of the GOP senators had supported a 2023 law that he said allows public officials to refuse to turn over certain documents during an audit, in addition to supporting the state’s Education Savings Account (ESA) program providing public funds for private school tuition and associated costs, which Sand has said does not allow for adequate oversight over how private schools spend taxpayer dollars.
Sand also questioned why lawmakers did not request an audit of the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners, the state entity that granted Roberts an administrator license in July 2023.
Gov. Kim Reynolds signed an executive order earlier in October requiring the licensure board, alongside all state government departments, to use the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems to verify applicants’ immigration and citizenship status when hiring workers and granting occupational and professional licenses.
“This is what legislators can request: They can request reviews of issues of spending by a state department with money from a state department. That’s it,” Sand said. “You’ll notice that none of them requested us to review what was going on with the Iowa (Board of) Education Examiners, who actually approved a license for Ian Roberts to teach. That might be partisan politics.”
Sand said if a qualifying request from a DMPS employee or school board member is made or a petition is submitted, the auditor’s office would not reveal the identity of the person making the request, but would confirm that an audit was requested or started. If an audit of DMPS is started, Sand refrained from giving any estimates on how long the investigation would take.
“The problem with giving people a time frame is, once you’ve given them a time frame, the integrity of your prediction of the time frame is competing with the integrity of the report,” Sand said. “You don’t want to put yourself in that situation, because you want to make sure that you’re focused on the integrity of the report. Sometimes it’s eight months. Sometimes it’s 18 months.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s updated campaign finance reporting system will launch on Oct. 28, according to a news release. 
Guardian 2.0, which provides public access to candidate expenditures and contributors, was initially set to launch Oct. 1 but was delayed for “final adjustments” and to ensure data was accurately converted between the old and new software systems.  
The change in the software system is a result of a vendor no longer supporting the old system. Guardian has been shut off since Sept. 19. 
The site also provides information about lobbyists, which candidates have filed ethics paperwork to run for public office and the formation of political action committees.
Guardian 2.0 will make filing and public access to campaign finance information easier, have a new login, and a more intuitive filing experience, according to the Ethics Commission’s website. The Legislature previously appropriated $1.2 million to the Ethics Commission for system updates. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said launching the system before it’s fully ready would create “far greater problems.” 
No filers will be penalized while the system is down, according to the Ethics Commission website. Staff at the Commission are available to work directly with filers.
Third quarter campaign finance reports are due Oct. 31. The reporting period could be extended with late fees waived if necessary, according to the Commission’s website. 
“Our responsibility is to deliver a product that performs accurately and securely from day one,” Bruce Boone said in a statement. “Taking the time to ensure the system is stable and the data is reliable reflects our commitment to doing this right—not just doing it fast.”
There could be minor technical issues when Guardian 2.0 launches but a support team will be available, she previously said.

Earlier this year, former-Attorney General Andrew Bailey accused Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang of abusing her discretion when she issued a temporary injunction that struck down several “targeted regulation of abortion providers,” or TRAP laws, as unconstitutional under the reproductive rights amendment approved by voters in November.
That injunction allowed Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis to start offering procedural abortions for the first time in years. 
The attorney general’s office in its appeal argued the TRAP laws should be re-enacted in part because they were not causing a high enough degree of “irreparable harm.” The harm was only “minor” because Missourians looking to end a pregnancy could instead travel to Illinois or Kansas for an abortion, the attorney general’s office wrote in court filings. 
The appeals court unanimously rejected Bailey’s argument on Tuesday, calling it “disingenuous.” 
“The irreparable harm flowing from a denial of abortion care within the confines of the Missouri (reproductive rights amendment) are unique because an abortion decision by an expectant mother ‘simply cannot be postponed, or it will be made by default with far-reaching consequences,’” wrote Judge Mark D. Pfeiffer, citing an earlier ruling by Zhang.
The appeals court also found no proof of Zhang abusing her discretion, noting that she applied “exhaustive consideration” to both sides’ arguments by conducting multiple hearings and sifting through hundreds of pages of written briefs over several months. 
Plus, the appeals court noted, the bench trial on the matter is set for January, which is only a few months away. At that trial, Zhang will make a final ruling on the lawsuit filed last November by the ACLU of Missouri and the two Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state. 
Until then, the temporary injunction in place prevents the state from enforcing a handful of regulations, including requirements that patients have two visits at least seventy-two hours apart before having an abortion and that abortion clinics be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers.
Missouri attorney general subpoenas Planned Parenthood for patient abortion records

Bailey previously appealed Zhang’s decision to the Missouri Supreme Court, which said the attorney general should have first appealed to the western district before taking his request to the state’s highest court. 
The office, now run by Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, can appeal Tuesday’s decision to the Missouri Supreme Court. A spokesperson for Hanaway did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Zhang is still considering a separate request from Planned Parenthood to overturn even more state regulations that Planned Parenthood argues are preventing clinics from prescribing mifepristone and misoprostol, which are used in medication abortions. 
About two-thirds of abortions nationally are performed using medication.  
Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains based in the Kansas City area, accused the attorney general of being one of several examples of “disingenuous” state leadership. She pointed to an abortion ban proposed by the Republican legislature that will appear on the November 2026 ballot, coupled with attempts to make it more difficult to amend the constitution through citizen-led initiative petitions, which is how the reproductive rights amendment ended up on the ballot. 
“We will not stand by while extremist officials try to override the law and the will of the people,” Wales said in a statement Tuesday. “Missourians deserve better.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0818-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

(Provided by USC)COLUMBIA — A competitive scholarship program for University of South Carolina sports management students is now permanent with a $5 million donation from NFL owner David Tepper and his wife Nicole.
In recognition of the gift, USC named the David and Nicole Tepper Department of Sport and Entertainment Management on Tuesday after the family of the Carolina Panthers owner.
“What I could say for not only this department and school, but for the university overall — they care,” Nicole Tepper told reporters. “They put time into each student. The student’s success is the university’s success.
“That just draws people like Dave and I in to say, we want to invest, and we want to be a part of it,” she added.
The Teppers, through the family’s charitable foundation, funded the Tepper Scholars Program at USC, starting with $1.5 million six years ago. The additional $5 million will continue that into perpetuity.
David Tepper, a hedge fund billionaire who grew up in Pittsburgh, and Nicole Tepper, who was raised in New Jersey, have a personal connection to the South Carolina school: One of their daughters received a bachelor’s degree from USC, though they did not say when.
The dollar amount awarded to scholars varies from year to year but covers a large portion of students’ tuition, said college spokesman Allen Wallace.
The scholars also work a summer internship with the Teppers’ sports and events management company, which includes the Panthers and the Major League Soccer Charlotte Football Club.
“It was always my dream to work in professional sports but being from a small island I saw it as something perhaps unattainable,” said Ambar Ferra, a class of 2025 sports management graduate and scholarship recipient from Puerto Rico. “Where I am from, there are not opportunities like this.”
Through the program, Ferra took part in two Tepper Sports internships. Today, she works as an event services coordinator for the Houston Dynamo and Dash soccer teams.
“Thank you, Nicole and David, for giving a young girl from Puerto Rico the opportunity to live her dream and shine,” said Ferra, who is among 24 scholarship recipients so far.
Other Tepper scholars have gone on to work for the Panthers, as well as the Cleveland Browns and the Washington Commanders. Most attended the USC announcement.
The Teppers’ latest donation also pays for three professorships at the school, “bringing elite practitioner-educators into USC classrooms,” according to a statement.
“By investing in students through scholarships, mentorship, and access to industry expertise, we can help create lasting impact,” the couple said in a statement. “It’s inspiring to see how the Tepper Scholars have already begun shaping the future of this field, and we are proud to build on this partnership with the University to continue opening doors for talented students for years to come.”
The degree program is among one of the most popular at USC, with about 1,600 students currently enrolled.
The announcement comes six years after the Legislature passed an incentives package intended to bring the Panthers’ headquarters south of the border.
But in 2022, David Tepper pulled the Panthers out of plans to build a $500 million practice facility and headquarters in Rock Hill, abandoning the site where work began two years earlier. The failed complex, once seen as a game-changer for the region, fell apart over a dispute related to bond funding for roads and other infrastructure leading into the 240-acre site along Interstate 77.
Three years later, the site remains undeveloped, with an $80 million state-funded interchange from I-77 to nothing. The city, which purchased the land, announced this month that it is marketing it as an industrial park, targeting manufacturing and life sciences businesses, according to WCNC-TV, a Charlotte NBC affiliate.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tepper.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

Remnants of a powerful typhoon swept into Western Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta on Oct. 12, 2025, producing a storm surge that flooded villages as far as 60 miles up the river. The water pushed homes off their foundations and set some afloat with people inside, officials said. More than 50 people had to be rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, hundreds were displaced in the region, and at least one person died.
Typhoon Halong was an unusual storm, likely fueled by the Pacific’s near-record warm surface temperatures this fall. Its timing means recovery will be even more difficult than usual for these hard-hit communities, as Alaska meteorologist Rick Thoman of the University Alaska Fairbanks explains.
Disasters in remote Alaska are not like disasters anywhere in the lower 48 states, he explains. While East Coast homeowners recovering from a nor’easter that flooded parts of New Jersey and other states the same weekend can run to Home Depot for supplies or drive to a hotel if their home floods, none of that exists in remote Native villages.

 What made this storm unusual?

Halong was an ex-typhoon, similar to Merbok in 2022, by the time it reached the delta. A week earlier, it had been a powerful typhoon east of Japan. The jet stream picked it up and carried it to the northeast, which is pretty common, and weather models did a pretty good job in forecasting its track into the Bering Sea.
But as the storm approached Alaska, everything went sideways.
The weather model forecasts changed, reflecting a faster-moving storm, and Halong shifted to a very unusual track, moving between Saint Lawrence Island and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta coast.

Unlike Merbok, which was very well forecast by the global models, this one’s final track and intensity weren’t clear until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters. That’s too late for evacuations in many places.
 Did the loss of weather balloon data canceled in 2025 affect the forecast?

That’s a question for future research, but here’s what we know for sure: There have not been any upper-air weather balloon observations at Saint Paul Island in the Bering Sea since late August or at Kotzebue since February. Bethel and Cold Bay are limited to one per day instead of two. At Nome, there were no weather balloons for two full days as the storm was moving toward the Bering Sea.
Did any of this cause the forecast to be off? We don’t know because we don’t have the data, but it seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance.
 Why is the delta region so vulnerable in a storm like Halong?

The land in this part of western Alaska is very flat, so major storms can drive the ocean into the delta, and the water spreads out.
Most of the land there is very close to sea level, in some places less than 10 feet above the high tide line. Permafrost is also thawing, land is subsiding, and sea-level rise is adding to the risk. For many people, there is literally nowhere to go. Even Bethel, the region’s largest town, about 60 miles up the Kuskokwim River, saw flooding from Halong.
These are very remote communities with no roads to cities. The only way to access them is by boat or plane. Right now, they have a lot of people with nowhere to live, and winter is closing in.
Native residents of Kipnuk discuss the challenges of permafrost loss and climate change in their village. Alaska Institute for Justice.
These villages are also small. They don’t have extra housing or the resources to rapidly recover. The region was already recovering from major flooding in summer 2024. Kipnuk’s tribe was able to get federal disaster aid, but that aid was approved only in early January 2025.
 What are these communities facing in terms of recovery?

People are going to have really difficult decisions to make. Do they leave the community for the winter and hope to rebuild next summer?
There likely isn’t much available housing in the region, with the flooding so widespread on top of a housing shortage. Do displaced people go to Anchorage? Cities are expensive.
There is no easy answer.
It’s logistically complicated to rebuild in places like Kipnuk. You can’t just get on the phone and call up your local building contractor.
Almost all of the supplies have to come in by barge – plywood to nails to windows – and that isn’t going to happen in winter. You can’t truck it in – there are no roads. Planes can only fly in small amounts – the runways are short and not built for cargo planes.

The National Guard might be able to help fly in supplies. But then you still need to have people who can do the construction and other repair work.
Everything is 100 times more complicated when it comes to building in remote communities. Even if national or state help is approved, it would be next summer before most homes could be rebuilt.
 Is climate change playing a role in storms like these?

That will be another question for future research, but sea-surface temperature in most of the North Pacific that Typhoon Halong passed over before reaching the Aleutian Islands has been much warmer than normal. Warm water fuels storms.

A comparison of daily sea-surface temperatures shows how anomalously warm much of the northern Pacific Ocean was ahead of and during Typhoon Halong. (NOAA Coral Reef Watch)
Halong also brought lots of very warm air northward with it. East of the track on Oct. 11, Unalaska reached 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), an all-time high there for October.

(Credit: Getty)The nonprofit Poynter Institute on Tuesday announced a pilot project establishing a “public editor” to serve the Indianapolis news market.
The Indianapolis Public Editor project will “act as a bridge” between the area’s newsrooms and “test the effectiveness” of independent accountability and public education in a local news market, the news release said.
The public editor will be a news media critic focused on how Indianapolis outlets provide coverage in line with the needs of local communities.
The project is led by Poynter’s senior vice president Kelly McBride, chair of Poynter’s Craig Newmark Center for Ethics and Leadership, and has received grant funding from the Lumina and Hearst Foundations. Poynter is currently accepting applications for the role.
“The goal of a local public editor is to help the people who live in Indianapolis understand their news ecosystem better,” McBride said, “and ultimately enable people to hold their local journalists accountable for what they need from them, and also when appropriate, to elevate great journalism.”
The public editor will examine the entire news ecosystem that serves Indiana’s capital, answering questions from the audience and explaining how journalists throughout the market make decisions about coverage. Those columns will appear on the project’s partner newsrooms, which currently include the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Mirror Indy and WFYI public radio.
Additional newsrooms are considering joining the project at a later date.










The goal of a local public editor is to help the people who live in Indianapolis understand their news ecosystem better and ultimately enable people to hold their local journalists accountable for what they need from them, and also when appropriate to elevate great journalism


– Kelly McBride


While a public editor works closely with journalists and newsrooms to write about coverage, their loyalty is with the news audience, the release said.
“The public editor can get your questions answered. They have the experience and the credibility to encourage journalists to respond,” McBride said. “They also have the experience to understand the journalism process.They are often explaining how the process works and why the process isn’t meeting the needs of the public.”
Mirror Indy Editor-in-Chief Oseye Boyd said her newsroom is participating to help increase community understanding of what Mirror Indy does and why.
“This not only provides an opportunity to increase media literacy in our city, but also allows community members to hold us accountable in how we cover them,” she said.
Greg Petrowich, WFYI president and CEO, said the Indianapolis public radio station was eager to participate.
“At a time when public trust in news is at a critical low, the role of a public editor offers transparency and education around how news is gathered and reported,” he said.
McBride said the goal is to hire the public editor and begin the work before the end of 2025. The public editor will live in Indianapolis and have a journalism background.
The project also plans to hold public events with the news audience, the public editor and news organizations. There are only a handful of public editors in the U.S., and those that exist tend to work for a single news organization, such as McBride’s role at NPR.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Indiana-Capitol-2-GettyImages-1089342774-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 14:57:23.481296

(Photo courtesy USF)Tampa Bay Students for a Democratic Society, a group protesting in support of Palestinian rights, filed suit last week against the University of South Florida, claiming the university violated members’ constitutional rights after expelling one student and disciplining others. 
In an 85-page complaint filed in federal court in Tampa, the group [TBSDS] alleges 19 counts against the university, including negligent training, conspiracy to violate rights, defamation, libel, slander, discrimination, and violation of due process and free speech. 
“Since at least October of 2023, Defendants have conspired to violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory rights by suppressing their speech and advocacy, stigmatizing their organization, and subjecting them to baseless and discriminatory conduct sanctions, all due to their protected speech and activity in support of Palestinians, and in defense of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs that benefit minority students,” attorneys for the students wrote. 
The suit names the USF trustees, USF Police Department, President Rhea Law, Assistant Dean and Director of Student Conduct & Ethical Development Melissa Graham, and Dean of Students Danielle McDonald. 
Plaintiff Victoria Hinckley was expelled days before she was to graduate, and suspension and other conduct sanctions were made against Saba Indawala and Vicky Tong. They seek monetary damages and injunctive relief, including reversal of sanctions against the students.
The plaintiffs claim USF was “treating them differently from other similar situated persons because of the Palestinian nationality, ethnicity, and alienage and association therewith of Plaintiffs and their speech,” and were “singled out” “in conspiracy with several high profile local megadonors including but not limited to the JCC [Jewish Community Centers & Federation] as part of a cash for influence scheme.”
The plaintiffs cite initiatives between JCC and other organizations and the university, saying JCC and USF “have conspired for over a decade to target and silence pro-Palestinian speech.”

Timeline
Among the damages alleged: “Plaintiffs have sustained severe emotional pain, anguish, humiliation, insult, indignity, loss of self-esteem, inconvenience and hurt, postponed graduations among other things, and have suffered tremendous mental and emotional damages due to Defendants’ conspiracy to silence and stigmatize them on campus”
The group objects to university allegations that students started a riot and says that administrators used “sham conduct proceedings that fail to provide basic due process protections.” It also alleges “the creation of arbitrary and capricious policies contemporaneous with or immediately after pro-Palestine events, without notice or due process” and discriminatory application of those policies against the organization. 
In February 2024, after pro-Palestine flyers were posted on campus, the “USF administration caved to this external anti-Palestinian pressure and complied with the demand by scheduling a disciplinary meeting — itself a significant disincentive for students to continue their advocacy in support of Palestinians.”
In April 2024, the organization protested budget cuts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, including a march to McDonald’s office to deliver petitions, the suit says. “In retaliation for this petition delivery action, Defendants issued TBSDS four conduct charges and put the organization on interim suspension.”
They allege that during the Spring 2024 semester, McDonald shut down all organizational tabling efforts. 
The most detailed account in the complaint involved attempts to host events remembering the “Nakba,” or “catastrophe,” referring to the Arab perspective of the 1948 creation of Israel that displaced Palestinians, despite bans and time, place, and manner restrictions from the university. As the timeline goes, students were shut down by campus police because the location had been declared a study zone. 
At 1 p.m., the group asked what time the curfew would be imposed. At 4:30, McDonald replied “5:00.” The “curfew was created out of thin air, with no basis in USF policies or procedures, and with insufficient notice to Plaintiffs and others assembled in the Plaza.”
That night, the plaintiffs allege, “USF hastily installed surveillance cameras on a tree next to the MLK Plaza in furtherance of its campaign of intimidation against Plaintiffs.”
The next day, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse students who pressed the 5 p.m. curfew and students were arrested. 
“​​In the moments after the tear gas was deployed, a TBSDS-associated student asked MCDONALD whether she approved of the police brutality against USF students, and MCDONALD stated she was happy to see it,” the suit alleges. 
The suit claims that President Law “falsely stated that the protest stopped being peaceful when Plaintiffs and other students attempted to stay in the MLK Plaza past 5:00 pm.”
The suit details other run-ins, including one in which McDonald attempted to “corral” students who showed up to a protest advocating for free expression. Some students were issued a trespass warning during that encounter. 
The suit alleges “[s]elective over-enforcement of those new and arbitrary policies against TBSDS and its members to interfere with and terminate pro-Palestinian events and cripple the TBSDS organization on campus, by violating the organization or its members’ ability to advocate, assemble, and speak.”
The school eliminated the group as a student organization and has rejected attempts for it to form again under another name. The complaint seeks restoration of the group’s campus registration.
The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday.
In the months following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Florida politicians boasted about how universities in the state handled pro-Palestine protesters and punished alleged anti-semitic behavior.

(Photo by Chris Dorst/Charleston Gazette-Mail)Bridge Day, West Virginia’s largest one-day festival, will go on Saturday, even if the federal government is still shut down, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Tuesday.
The state is paying nearly $100,000 to keep its national parks — New River Gorge and Harpers Ferry — open despite the federal shutdown. That agreement ends Friday night, Morrisey said. 
Morrisey said Tuesday he intends to extend that agreement with the federal government if federal operations have not resumed by then. If necessary, he’ll extend the agreement through the end of the month, he said. 
Last year, the state’s tourism industry had a $9.1 billion economic impact, Morrisey said. In the past year, 1.8 million people have visited the New River Gorge National Park. More than 200,000 people visit the New River Gorge in October alone, he said.
Bridge Day, held annually on the third Saturday in October, draws tens of thousands of people to the New River Gorge National Park to see BASE jumpers parachute from the structure on the only day it’s legal. Last year, 325 certified BASE jumpers reportedly participated in the event.  BASE stands for building, antenna, span (such as a bridge) and earth.
‘So this was not the time to be shut down,” Morrisey said. 
Becky Sullivan, president of the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce, said as of Tuesday, more than 300 BASE jumpers have registered from 39 states and four countries have registered for Bridge Day. More than 200 repellers. 
More than 500 people from 26 states have also registered to take part in a 5K race on the bridge Saturday morning, she said. More than 200 vendors from several states will participate in the festival as well.
“Bridge Day has a huge economic impact on Fayette County and our surrounding region,” Sullivan said. “The entire New River Gorge region benefits from Bridge Day. It is a huge event for our state. It is a huge event for our area.” She added her thanks to Morrisey and Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby that this year’s event will go on.
The federal government shut down at midnight Oct. 1 after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year to keep services running. At issue are enhanced health care subsidies that particularly impact West Virginians. Democrats in Congress want to see these subsidies included in the spending bill. Republicans do not.
The enhanced subsidies — which are for plans purchased on the Health Insurance Marketplace — are set to expire at the end of the year. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the subsidies expiring is projected to cause 4.2 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2034.
Thousands of West Virginians in particular will be impacted if the health care subsidies end. About 67,000 West Virginians buy their health care on the marketplace. The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy said that West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace will see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually if the subsidies end. If the premiums expire, about 15,000 West Virginians will lose their health care because they can no longer afford it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy.

In the hearing, judges and lawyers debated the threshold — if not biological species — of when to grant such rights. 
The Nonhuman Rights Project, a legal advocacy organization, has sued the DeYoung Family Zoo for living conditions that they consider to be violations of the bodily liberty of chimpanzees housed there.
Lawyers for the chimpanzees are seeking an order to hear the merits of the case — essentially, to have a decision on the content of the case, as opposed to procedural matters — in the suit for the habeas corpus rights of seven chimpanzees, who the group refers to as the “DeYoung Prisoners“.
“It’s a novel issue, obviously,” said Judge Brock Swartzle, the presiding judge in the hearing, as he and fellow judges Matthew Ackerman and Christopher Trebilcock considered the arguments presented by Jake Davis, the attorney for the Nonhuman Rights Project.

The Menominee County Circuit Court dismissed the case in December 2023, determining that the law’s use of the word “person” made the chimpanzees ineligible for the relief that their lawyers were seeking — transfer out of the DeYoung zoo, which they called in the hearing an “unjust confinement,” to a designated sanctuary. 
The Nonhuman Rights Project filed its appeal in January 2024, arguing that Michigan common law — not a statute that includes the word “person” — should determine the outcome of the case, instead relying on the autonomy of chimpanzees. 
For those representing the chimpanzees, the case goes beyond these seven animals, however. 
“What’s at stake here really is whether suffering chimpanzees are entitled to go to a sanctuary, and also whether protection of liberty and autonomy is going to remain the supreme law in Michigan or whether it’s going to get truncated,” Christopher Berry, the executive director of the Nonhuman Rights Project, said after the hearing’s conclusion. 
Davis presented judges with the story of Tommy, another chimpanzee that had been at the DeYoung Family Zoo and died there, as an example of why the seven chimpanzees named in the case should be granted habeas corpus rights. 
When Tommy was moved without notice from a zoo in New York to the DeYoung zoo, it “epitomized his status as a rightless thing, his legal status as a rightless thing,” Davis said.  “Tommy could be bought, could be sold, he could be used and he could be trafficked, all without the slightest hiccup.”
Swartzle asked Davis how far he would go in expanding habeas corpus rights beyond humans. “You’re asking for something fairly extraordinary,” Swartzle said. “If you want us to go over that line into non-humans, where do we draw a sensible line?”

For Davis, that line is simple — autonomy, which can be defined as “self determined behavior based on freedom of choice,” he said, presenting research from famed late primatologist Jane Goodall, that chimpanzees largely experience the world the same way humans do. 
Goodall wrote similarly in a scientific declaration in the case, filed in late 2023, “There is ample proof from studies of chimpanzee behavior, both in the wild and in captivity, that chimpanzees are autonomous beings with a highly complex cognitive nature, which can be illustrated by their ability to perform complex tasks.”
But for Swartzle, the ability — or lack thereof — of an animal like a chimpanzee to participate in what was referred to as the “social contract” presented questions on whether autonomy was enough to grant rights like these.

Lawyers for the DeYoung Family Zoo, who were not required to appear in court for this hearing, were not present. 
While the decision of the court is still forthcoming, Ginny Mikita, a Michigan lawyer working alongside the Nonhuman Rights Project in the case, said after the hearing that she felt positive about the outcome based on how the judges responded to their arguments. 
“I’m feeling hopeful,” she said. “The judges today clearly had given a lot of thought to this case and were fully engaged in the argument.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)For the first time since Floridians voted to restore voting rights to most people with felony convictions, the state has agreed to provide timely information about which of them have paid the financial obligations that would entitle them to cast ballots.
That change is the result of negotiations last year after the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition dropped its 2023 lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, and other Florida election officials. The coalition had alleged the state had  created “such a bureaucratic system around the implementation of Amendment 4” that it prevented Florida citizens from voting.
More than 65% of Floridians approved Amendment 4 in 2018, ostensibly restoring voting rights to all individuals who had completed their sentences (except for those who committed murders and sexual offenses). In 2019, the Legislature passed implementing language requiring felons (or “returning citizens”) to have paid any legal financial obligations, including fines, fees, or restitution imposed on them by a judge, before they could see their voting rights restored.
In a highly publicized incident just days before the August 2022 primary election, the then-newly formed Florida Office of Election Crimes and Security arrested 20 individuals for alleged voter fraud, mostly those with past felony convictions. Several of those arrested had received voter registration cards from the state, leading them to believe that their rights had been restored.
Now individuals with felony convictions who have completed their sentences but remain uncertain whether they still have legal financial obligations to fill out a request form to the Department of State to inquire about voting eligibility.
Screenshot of top of form that individuals with felony convictions in Florida can now complete and send to the state’s Division of Elections to verify voting eligibility.
New form
“We have a standardized form that will cost the individual nothing if they want to submit information to us as to whether or not that they are eligible,” Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd said last week before the Florida House Government Operations Subcommittee. “We’re happy to do that. We do that on a regular basis.”
As part of the final rule, the state now has a 14-day deadline to respond to an initial request to determine whether a submitted form is complete and 90 days to issue an advisory opinion after receiving that completed request.
The advisory opinion would be one of three responses:

The individual is eligible to register to vote.
The individual is ineligible to register and vote.
The Division of Elections lacks credible and reliable information — therefore, “nothing precludes you from registering and voting.”

The program is similar to legislation filed by Rep. Dotie Joseph, D-North Miami, (HB 1525) and Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, (SB 904) during the 2024 legislative session.
Desmond Meade, president and executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, says the original lawsuit was ultimately about whose responsibility is it to determine voter eligibility.
“The primary purpose of this piece is to take away the mens rea part of it,” Meade said last week, referring to the concept in criminal law that separates accidental acts from intentional crimes.
“If the state wants to charge somebody with committing a certain crime, part of the element that they must show beyond a reasonable doubt is that they were doing something wrong,” he said.  “That is a key element in any voting case that you’re going to come across.”
For the past several years, Florida Democrats have filed legislation to establish a centralized database to track the voting-rights status of individuals with felony convictions. A 2026 version (HB 73) has been filed in the House by Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens, and in the Senate (SB 132) by Polsky to require the Florida Commission on Offender Review to maintain a financial obligations database.
Secretary Byrd was responding last week to an inquiry from newly elected Rep. RaShon Young, D-Orlando, who said returning citizens in his community were “still expressing confusion” about the verification process. Young asked what steps the Department of State was taking to “reduce that confusion” and make the process clearer.
Byrd mentioned the new form and told Young that it was important the information “is getting out to the people in your community and we will conduct that information, because we’re doing it, so that people know that we don’t want to trap anybody into a felony.”
Meade said he thinks the new process is “great first step” for the state. He adds that he’d like the Department of State to make the form more accessible online if possible, and also hopes the agency could partner with voting rights groups like his own to get the word out to affected individuals.
“Now people who want to be part of democracy can get an answer in a timely manner that would direct them one way or another, and it takes away the necessity for the state to even go after these folks and spend millions of dollars trying to prosecute people who should not be prosecuted in the first place,” he said.
The Phoenix reached out to the Department of State for comment, but officials there declined to provide a response.

King, The Who and ZZ Top and other stars, and his love of music and show business took him around the world.
The love of the blues, historic homes and his wife, Madison native Suzanne Case, brought him to Mississippi, where he moved full-time after he retired in 2016. The veteran publicist Dera died Friday in Bentonia. He was 74.
“A list of everyone he worked with would probably be 20 pages long,” said Chris Roslan, a former business partner of Dera’s. 
Dera “always had a real fascination with old houses,” including one from the 1700s that he had in New York and the home where he an Case were living in Bentonia, Roslan said.
“He also loved blues music, so I think that also drew him to that area,” Roslan said.
In his five-decade career Dera represented marquee stars and entertainment brands.
Dera eventually started his own company, Dera & Associates, and his clients also included Billy Joel, Queen, Robert Palmer, UB40, Clint Black, Duran Duran, Foreigner, Ray Davis, Pink Floyd, The Band, Alabama, Les Paul and Rick Springfield. He did public relations work for big events, including Live Aid and Woodstock ’99.
Dera
Dera served as former Beatle Paul McCartney’s spokesman for over 20 years. He also represented the National Geographic Society, Dick Clark Productions, the American Music Awards, the History Channel and Gibson Guitars, among many others.
Dera was born in the Netherlands, son of a Dutch coal miner who moved the family to New Jersey.
His first foray into music was interviewing Robert Palmer for his community college newspaper. Dera would later become Palmer’s press agent and Palmer helped Dera start his own firm years later.
After retiring, Dera and Case moved to the historic Bradshaw House in Yazoo County, where he provided free PR counsel to local businesses. He and Case were active in rescuing and caring for abandoned dogs.
In a 2017 interview with the Clarion Ledger, Dera said he had many fond memories from his career, albeit in a dog-eat-dog industry often full of outsized egos.
“Even those with tough reputations are real sweethearts,” Dera said. And he said living in Mississippi had been “fun.”
“I don’t miss the snow,” Dera said then. “It’s all summer weather here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/14091858/Dera.jpg,,,2025-10-14 13:58:19.508992

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA — Castle Brazil sat alone Monday night in the back of a church sanctuary in Lenexa as he processed the “insane” revelations about Republican plans for a special session on redistricting.
The Johnson County Community College student — who sat with a sign reading, “People choose the politicians / not the other way!” — said it angered him that other people his age weren’t interested in attending the public forum. When Brazil tried to get a friend to come with him, the friend decided he would rather go to McDonald’s.
An aspiring teacher, Brazil said he is civically engaged in part because his mom is active duty military and his dad is with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
“When I talk to people my age, the most common response is, ‘Oh, I don’t really keep up with that stuff.’ But when I tell them actually what’s going on, then they get upset,” Brazil said. “It’s like, if they actually knew, they would be upset, too.”
One of the things he learned at the forum: Republicans could vote on new congressional maps as soon as Nov. 7.
“That’s insane, right?” Brazil said.


Republican legislative leaders on Monday authorized $460,000 to cover up to four days of a special session, which is contingent on getting two-thirds of both the state Senate and House members to sign a petition. Their goal would be to gerrymander Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids out of office by fragmenting Johnson County among two or more congressional districts.
Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said in a statement that there was “a misunderstanding out there” about redistricting efforts.
“I’m not drawing a map,” Masterson said. “A group of federal redistricting experts is developing a map from a federal perspective.”
A spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a Kansas Reflector inquiry seeking clarity about who the experts are and the meaning of “a federal perspective.”
Masterson confirmed to Kansas Reflector that legislators were preparing to meet Wednesday with White House policy staff in Washington, D.C., “to discuss a range of administration policy priorities.” But, he said, redistricting “is not on the agenda.”
Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat who is seeking her party’s nomination for governor in next year’s race, organized the Monday night forum to bring awareness to the community about the prospect of a special session on redistricting. She was joined in the panel discussion by Connie Brown Collins, of the Voter Rights Network of Wyandotte County, and Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, D-Overland Park. Johnson County Commissioner Julie Brewer moderated the discussion for a crowd of about 150 at Shawnee Mission Unitarian Universalist Church.
After the forum, Holscher posted on her campaign Facebook page the names and phone numbers of eight House Republicans who have yet to sign the special session petition. There are 88 Republicans in the House, where 84 are needed to call a special session.

Sticky fingers and a fat crayon
Sawyer Clayton predicted Republican legislative leaders would meet with the state’s GOP congressional delegation while in Washington this week to finalize the drawing of a new map.
She said the build-up to a special session detoured from the usual redistricting process, where congressional and legislative districts are redrawn once every decade to reflect changes in the census count. Those efforts are accompanied by a series of public forums held around the state so a legislative committee can gather feedback.
Additionally, Sawyer Clayton said, Republicans in the special session could rely on “parliamentary loopholes” to ensure the public gets “zero input.” Instead of holding committee hearings with testimony on the new maps, legislative leaders could bring them straight to the Senate and House floor for a vote.
“We have heard that that is a possibility,” she said.
She referred to the situation as “this bizarre redistricting scenario hellscape.”
“I think one of the problems is that when you see politicians drawing maps it’s kind of a fox guarding the chicken coop kind of thing,” Sawyer Clayton said. “We want these maps to be drawn with these dignified quills of our founding fathers. Instead, what we’re seeing is someone with sticky fingers and a big fat crayon following their id, when they should be following their sacred duty. But here we are.”
She said Republicans were violating the public’s trust by placing politics ahead of their duty to serve constituents.
“A lot of times I’ll sit there and I’ll look at these moments and I’ll think: This is why everyone hates us. This is why everyone hates politicians. It’s when these types of games occur,” she said.

Powerless and disheartened
Brown Collins warned the Johnson County crowd that they could suffer the same fate as voters in Wyandotte County.
Republicans in 2022 tried to remove Davids from office by breaking the Kansas City metro into two districts. They sliced the north half of Wyandotte County out of Davids’ 3rd District and placed it into the 2nd District, which covers most of the eastern third of the state, outside of Kansas City and Wichita. To preserve the Republican advantage, they moved the Democratic stronghold of Lawrence out of the 2nd District and into the vast 1st District that covers all of western Kansas.
Brown Collins said her community is no longer valued or represented in Congress, and voter turnout has suffered.
The community doesn’t support the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the president’s executive orders, abolishing diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the siphoning of funds from public schools to prop of private schools, or the detention of law-abiding immigrants, she said.
“The list goes on,” she said. “These issues and policies directly and negatively impact our communities.”
Most people, she said, won’t even bother to approach Republican U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt, who represents the community, about their concerns.
“It’s not a good situation when you feel powerless to be able to put forth your needs and wants, your priorities, because you don’t feel you’ll be heard,” Brown Collins said. “So yeah, that’s very much the case, and it’s, it’s disheartening to a lot of people.”

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) joined a group of U.S. Senate Democrats sponsoring a bill to protect federal workers and contractors during the federal shutdown.
According to a Tuesday news release,  the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), would protect federal workers during the shutdown and for 30 days afterward from being evicted or foreclosed; having their cars or other property repossessed; falling behind on their student loan payments; having negative effects on their credit histories; falling behind on bill payments; and losing insurance due to missed premium payments.
“Federal workers make our government work for New Mexico families — from caring for our veterans to maintaining our public lands and keeping our communities safe. They shouldn’t have to suffer because Republicans in Congress refuse to come to the table and work with Democrats to lower health care costs,” Heinrich said in a statement. “Every hardworking New Mexican deserves the dignity of financial stability and security. The Federal Employees Civil Relief Act will help ensure that the folks who keep our country running aren’t left wondering how they’ll pay their bills or keep their homes during Trump’s manufactured crisis.”
Cosponsors of the bill in the Senate include Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and U.S. Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawai‘i), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), and Mark Warner (D-Va.). Companion legislation in the House of Representatives is set to be introduced by U.S. Representative Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.).
“While the President and congressional Republicans continue to refuse to work with Democrats to stop health care costs from skyrocketing and reopen the government, people are suffering,” sponsor Schatz said in a statement. “Right now, hundreds of thousands of federal workers, federal contractor employees, and their families don’t know whether they’ll be able to pay rent and make ends meet. Our bill will protect these workers and make sure they aren’t harmed during this shutdown.”
Several unions support the bill, including the American Federation of Government Employees.
“This bill provides essential protections for federal workers who, through no fault of their own, face severe financial hardship during a government shutdown,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. “No public servant should be at risk of eviction, repossession, or losing health insurance simply because they are working without pay or furloughed.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Heinrich-2-1024x684.jpeg,,,2025-10-14 13:58:19.508992

The Trump administration’s obsession with sending National Guard troops hither and yon brings back memories of the time I spent as a member of a mobilized Guard unit. 
It was 63 years ago on Sept. 30, and yes, it did coincide with the admission of James Meredith as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi. I was a senior journalism student at Ole Miss and a part-time reporter for The Oxford Eagle. I also had another part-time job as a member of the Mississippi National Guard, one I had held since high school. 
All three came together in the last week of September 1962. I covered Lt. Gov. Paul Johnson, who was in Oxford to deny Meredith’s enrollment because Gov. Ross Barnett’s flight was fogged in at Jackson and could not be there himself to turn Meredith away. Things got even more interesting that weekend.
On Saturday, Sept. 29, Gov. Barnett called up the National Guard to go to Oxford to stop the U.S. Justice Department from enrolling Meredith on Oct. 1. A contingent of federal officials, including U.S. marshals and Department of Justice officials, had flown in from Memphis with Meredith and placed him in a highly guarded dormitory.

My unit, B Troop of the 108th Armored Cavalry Regiment was based in Pontotoc, 30 miles from the university. After a night and the next day rounding up troops, we were ready to go. We soon heard, however, that we had a new boss. President John F. Kennedy had federalized the Mississippi National Guard, taking away Barnett’s biggest club. 
We heard that a crowd was gathering on campus. There had been an Ole Miss football game in Jackson the night before, where Barnett had vowed to keep Meredith out of Ole Miss. Students returning to campus found a phalanx of U.S. marshals and other assorted federal officers surrounding the Lyceum, the administration building. Students and outsiders, egged on by former Gen. Edwin Walker, soon were throwing bottles, rocks and Molotov cocktails at state Highway Patrol officers, U.S. marshals, other law enforcement officers and the contingent of the news media that had gathered.
The federal security was not large, and defenses became even weaker when the state Highway Patrol pulled away from the lines and refused to help the Feds.
It was soon obvious that things were out of hand. National Guard Troop E of the 108th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Oxford was the first unit onto the campus. Capt. Murry Falkner, nephew of novelist William Faulkner, was the commander. Falkner was hit by a chunk of concrete, sustaining a broken arm, but led his troops into the fray. Troop E only had 67 soldiers. Soon, the Water Valley National Guard was brought in. 
Pontotoc’s Troop B was next, and we loaded into our jeeps and troop trucks and headed west on U.S. Highway 6 to Oxford. On the 40-minute drive we were constantly being passed by cars heading to the same place as we were, but not for the same reason. Most did not know that Kennedy had taken the Guard away from Barnett and were shouting “let’s go get him,” (not the exact quotes). 
By the time we got on University Drive heading onto the campus, it was obvious things were going to be rough. As we went into the circle around the Grove, where the rioters were massed, we saw cars burned. One belonged to my professor Samuel Talbert, chair of the Journalism Department. We did not have time to think about what we were seeing.

Suddenly, someone threw a Molotov cocktail firebomb from the Grove, striking the tailgate of our troop truck and fortunately falling back on the street and not torching us. Rocks and bottles pelted the side of our truck. Every obscenity known to man and newly concocted ones were yelled at us. 
We finally got in front of the Lyceum, jumped from our vehicles and began taking positions. We shined the lights of the vehicles into the Grove where the rioters were congregated, hoping that would help us spot trouble better.
We found out the next morning that might not have been our best move. One of our officers, Lt. John Fox, and I stood behind a jeep for a while observing the turmoil. The next morning Lt. Fox told me to look at the front of the jeep. I did and saw bullet holes in the windshield, around the headlights and on other parts of the jeep.
The rioters were not happy with the headlights and were trying to shoot them out. Fortunately, they did not hit us as we took shelter behind the vehicles.
The situation got worse after midnight when the word passed down the line that the U.S. marshals were running out of tear gas. That rather obnoxious gas was what was keeping the mob at bay. As the marshals fired their canisters fewer apart, the rioters moved close and closer to our lines in front of the Lyceum.
Things were becoming dangerously catastrophic. We had weapons and ammunition but not enough for the situation. We were attentive when we heard a “tromp, tromp, tromp” coming down toward the football stadium. Soon a line of soldiers from 503rd Military Police Battalion Airborne at Fort Bragg, wearing riot gear and carrying rifles with bayonets, marched up the street and took up positions. Kennedy had sent in the trained regular Army riot dispersers. 
I will never forget the gravelly-voiced sergeant who ordered his troops to “Right face,” so they would be facing the Grove. Then he said, “Fix bayonets!” Then he said, “Lock and load, one round.” The metallic ring of the bayonets and the click of the rifles being loaded obviously made an impact. Rioters were already running away before the sergeant ordered his troops into riot formation and they fanned out across the Grove. 
The real danger was over but there were skirmishes the next morning with Guardsmen and the MPs chasing scattered bands of dispersed rioters and troublemakers around the university campus and the city of Oxford. 
Two people were killed in the riot, many injured and there was looting, destruction of property and hijacking of cars. Besides the students who took part in the rioting, there were outsiders who came in from around the state and from surrounding states to preserve their sacred institution of segregation.
One Mississippi television station even encouraged people to go to Oxford to stop Meredith from enrolling. Gov. Barnett did not discourage anyone from going. 
Why rehash “The Oxford Incident” as the Feds called it, or “Operation Rocky Road” as the Mississippi National Guard termed it? 
It might be worth considering the circumstances as President Donald Trump seems intent on using the National Guard for his endeavors. Let us consider the situations in Los Angeles and Washington. No signs of rioting, people being killed by rioters, no looting, no extensive burning or property destruction. I did not see two Guard members standing behind a jeep for safety and finding bullet holes in it the next day.
In D.C., I saw Guard troops standing around national monuments, chatting with tourists and having their pictures taken with them. I saw Guard personnel stationed in front of federal buildings in Los Angeles with little activity around.
After college, as a reporter for United Press International, I covered a few other disturbances that involved the use of National Guard troops. There was always credible evidence for their use. 
There seem to be more plans for such far-fetched actions. Trump is trying now to send the Guard to other cities, like Chicago and Portland. He seems to have a gleam in his eye for New York City.
We have heard claims that there is serious trouble in all those cities, but the Trump minions have not brought any evidence to contradict relative scenes of peace. 
Force was needed at Ole Miss. There was rioting, looting, killing, property destruction and defiance of federal court orders. Force used to quell dangerous and catastrophic situations can be necessary.
Force used for personal whim and for personal political advantage without cause are a travesty against our democracy and Constitution. The Trump administration opts for the latter.

(Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Attorneys for Matthew Weiss, a former University of Michigan offensive coordinator who is accused of stealing intimate photos of nearly 150,000 student athletes in a hacking scheme, said Tuesday that the federal government is attempting to “turbocharge punishments” for what they consider a “routine computer trespass.”
Weiss is facing three fraud charges on 24 separate counts, of which counts 11 through 20 deal with fraud via identification documents. 
The former coordinator’s attorneys, David Benowitz and Paulette Pagan of the Price Benowitz law firm, on Tuesday filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to dismiss those counts, accusing federal prosecutors of pushing legal theories on shaky ground for the sole purpose of creating a test case out of Weiss’ prosecution.
Benowitz and Pagan have asked U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds of the Eastern District of Michigan to drop those charges because prosecutors are treating routine digital trespassing, which is prohibited under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as aggravated identity theft under the federal identity theft statute.

The attorneys warn that if the federal government is successful in prosecuting those counts under that theory – that each of those individual data trespass counts amount to aggravated identity theft – a conviction that would normally lead to a probation sentence could be morphed into a two-year mandatory sentence in prison for each act of hacking. Benowitz and Pagan said that could net Weiss up to 20 years total in prison.
“Congress has created a careful framework for how to punish computer hacking, and the government’s novel theory conflicts with Congress’s design in exactly the way [past precedent in Dubin v. United States] rejects,” the motion said. “This case should instead proceed as Congress intended: As a prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, not the Aggravated Identity Theft statute.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The counts Weiss’ attorneys are attempting to dismiss are among the heftiest facing the former offensive coordinator under former U of M Coach Jim Harbaugh. Weiss was alleged to have illegally accessed a database of athletes at more than 100 universities and colleges, downloaded their personal data, including medical records, and stole key account identifiers like login information.
Weiss is alleged to have then used those account identifiers and login information to hack the accounts of those athletes to steal intimate photos that were not intended to be released outside of intimate partners, prosecutors said in a March indictment.
The former coordinator is also facing a separate civil lawsuit from more than 50 women who said they were victims of Weiss’ hacking.

Notably, Weiss’ criminal case is still in its early stages; he has not faced trial, a jury has not yet determined his guilt in the matter and he has not been convicted of a crime.
Still, Weiss’ attorneys are arguing that if he were to be convicted under the computer fraud and abuse act, the sentencing guidelines call for a recommended sentence of probation. But they contend that’s not where prosecutors are headed, as they are approaching the crimes as violations of the aggravated identity theft statute.
“Counts 11-20 of the indictment in this case take a radically different approach based upon a novel bootstrapping theory: In the government’s view, the entering of login credentials to access another’s account – the standard way to begin a felony computer trespass under the CFAA – also triggers the two-year mandatory minimum punishment,” Weiss’ attorneys argued.” Under the government’s theory, routine acts of hacking can be double-counted to dramatically enhance punishments: The same misuse of usernames and passwords that enables hackers to enter computers in violation of the CFAA also counts as a theft of account holders’ identities, adding a two-year mandatory minimum for every felony hacking crime on top of the hacker’s otherwise-existing CFAA liability.”
The attorneys said they were aware of no court decision ever accepting that theory despite both statutes being in effect for several decades. Federal prosecutors’ basis for the 10 counts also requires the court to take on a broad reading of the aggravated identity theft statute, a position the Dubin case roundly rejected, Weiss’ attorneys added.
“This court should not be the first to do so. The government’s effort to revolutionize the law of computer hacking by pairing the [computer fraud and abuse act] and the Aggravated Identity Theft statute in this way is untenable,” the motion said. “Because the government’s theory presents an issue of law, rather than a dispute of fact, it is an appropriate subject for resolution under [federal court rules allowing for the dismissal of an indictment for failing to properly state a viable offense].”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Hundreds of thousands of more children in the United States are going without health insurance, and experts warn that actions by the Trump administration and Congress will likely make the problem worse.
The national uninsured rate for children and teens rose to 6% in 2024, up from 5.4% in 2023, according to new year-over-year data released by the U.S. Census Bureau in September. The rate is the highest in a decade and follows a trend of childhood coverage losses that began a few years before COVID-19 arrived and picked up again after the pandemic emergency response.
“The storm clouds are gathering for people who rely on public health insurance and Medicaid, but for children, sadly, they are already here,” said Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, during a briefing on the new child health data.
Last month, the center released an analysis of the latest census data, finding an 18% increase in the number of uninsured U.S. children between 2022 and 2024. The upsurge — which represents more than half a million additional kids who lost health coverage — affected nearly every racial and ethnic group. American Indian and Alaska Native children still had the highest uninsured rate by far, at 12.4% in 2024, compared to 9.7%, 5.5% and 4.9% among Hispanic, Black and white children, respectively.
Twenty-two states experienced a “significant increase” in the rate of uninsured kids from 2022 to 2024, according to the analysis. Just one state, New Hampshire, reported a “significant decrease,” from 3.4% to 2.3%.
Texas continues to have the highest rate of uninsured children ages 18 and under, at 13.6% in 2024, up nearly 3 percentage points from 2022. About 1.1 million Texas kids went without coverage last year, making up nearly a quarter of the nation’s 4.6 million uninsured children.


States with Medicaid expansion for low-income adults — now effective in all but 10 states — had lower uninsured rates among children than states without expansion on a cumulative basis, the Georgetown analysis found. Some expansion states still have relatively high rates, and non-expansion states relatively low ones.
Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus on Children, a national, bipartisan advocacy group, said he fears even more children will lose health coverage as states wrangle with the approximately $1 trillion in federal Medicaid cuts included in H.R. 1, the “big, beautiful” tax-and-spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in July.
“For 20 years, we cut the uninsured rate for kids — it’s probably one of the most significant things to happen to American children in a half a century,” Lesley said. “Now we’re going backward.”
Here are some answers to key questions on the issues based on data and interviews with advocates and experts.
Why is the children’s uninsured rate rising again?
In 1997, the year President Bill Clinton signed the budget bill creating the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 15% of U.S. kids — or 10.7 million — were uninsured, up from nearly 14% a couple of years earlier.
CHIP covers kids who don’t qualify for Medicaid but whose families can’t afford private coverage. Its creation led to a dramatic upswing in kids covered by both CHIP and Medicaid because of more intensive outreach efforts, according to federal officials. By 2016, coupled with the effects of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the rate of uninsured children dropped to a historic low of 4.7%.
Soon after, it started inching back up. By 2019, it was at 5.7%.


Lesley attributed the reversal to a number of actions by the first Trump administration, including weakening “welcome mat” programs and singling out coverage of lawfully present immigrants for additional scrutiny. For example, it slashed funding for ACA marketplace navigators, who help families find affordable coverage, by 84%.
It also expanded the “public charge” rule — which immigration officials use to determine if a person will likely rely on public assistance — to include Medicaid. The change didn’t apply to kids, but researchers documented a chilling effect that led to a drop in Medicaid enrollment of hundreds of thousands of children. The Biden administration reversed the rule change.
More recent drops in kids’ health coverage — those reflected in the new census data — follow the expiration of emergency COVID-19 rules that had paused all Medicaid disenrollments. Millions of children nationwide lost coverage during the Medicaid “unwinding,” when states resumed eligibility checks in spring 2023.
Not every state tackled unwinding the same, and disenrollment rates vary widely. In Oregon, for example, children’s Medicaid enrollment declined about 2%. In Texas, it declined by more than 30%, or by 1.3 million kids, and mostly for paperwork reasons, not because they were ineligible.
“If all states had done as poorly as Texas did with the unwinding,” Alker said, “we would have seen a much higher jump in the uninsured rate of children nationally.”
Will the child uninsured rate keep going up?
According to Alker, “it’s probably happening as we speak.”
Many of the same factors that drove down child coverage in 2016-2019 are back in the second Trump term, she said at the briefing, including funding cuts to ACA enrollment assistance and heightened fears among immigrant families.
Earlier this year, federal health officials agreed to share personal Medicaid data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A judge ordered the administration to stop the practice.
One in 4 children and teens in the U.S. has at least one immigrant parent, KFF found.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

“We’ve already had reports of families dropping coverage over data-privacy fears,” said Lynn Cowles, director of health and food justice at Every Texan, a nonprofit policy institute. “[Immigrants] are scared to go to appointments. … Health centers are getting more requests for telehealth.”
Children’s coverage will also take a hit if Congress lets enhanced ACA tax credits expire later this year. Enrollment in the ACA marketplace has more than doubled to over 24 million since enhanced credits became available in 2021. Those credits are at the heart of the impasse in Congress that’s led to the federal shutdown.
If the credits expire, out-of-pocket premiums will skyrocket and 4.2 million more people will be uninsured by 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. More than 2.1 million U.S. children depended on marketplace coverage in 2024, Georgetown researchers reported.
Cowles said more than 540,000 kids in Texas rely on ACA health plans. She expects many families will be priced out of the marketplace and become uninsured if tax credits expire.
State efforts that make it easier for low-income kids to stay insured face their own expiration date in Trump’s second term. In July, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said it would not renew or approve additional Medicaid waivers on multiyear coverage for children, citing spending concerns.
Nine states currently have such waivers to provide multiyear Medicaid coverage for kids from birth until age 6. Research shows continuous coverage in Medicaid or CHIP can reduce disenrollments and “churn,” or when kids move on and off the rolls.
In 2022, Oregon became the first state with a multiyear waiver. Dr. Ben Hoffman, a pediatrician at Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland, said the uninterrupted coverage addresses a “critical developmental period” in a young child’s life, when access to preventive and screening services is key.
“We want to make sure kids are as healthy and as ready as possible for kindergarten,” he said.
Oregon’s waiver expires in 2027, meaning families would return to more-frequent eligibility checks. Hoffman hopes the state will make that process as seamless as possible, but he suspects the end result “will be terrible for kids.”
“It’s just an underhanded way to increase turnover and lower costs through attrition,” Hoffman said about CMS’ decision. “In what universe is it beneficial to anybody for a child not to have health insurance?”
Will kids feel the trillion-dollar cut?
Trump signed the sweeping tax-and-spending bill, H.R. 1, in July, approving the biggest federal funding cut in Medicaid’s history — almost $1 trillion over 10 years.
A loss that large likely won’t spare children.
“With almost half of the nation’s children covered by Medicaid and CHIP, they cannot be shielded from a cut of approximately 11%,” Alker said.
Lesley, at First Focus on Children, agreed. State responses to the funding loss will vary and it’s still early, but he worries that lawmakers will seek out cost savings by putting up more enrollment hurdles for families.
“These barriers can be really tragic,” Lesley said
This story is part of “Uninsured in America,” a project led by Public Health Watch that focuses on life in America’s health-coverage gaps and the impact of potential Medicaid cuts and lack of expansion.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The region’s three biggest airports will not show a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming the federal government shutdown on Democrats.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bistate agency that oversees Newark Liberty, LaGuardia, and JFK airports, said airport-controlled screens will not play Noem’s video.
The 30-second spot, in which Noem warns that the shutdown could affect operations, violates the Port Authority’s longstanding policies that “prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities,” a spokesperson said in a statement to the New Jersey Monitor.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

The three airports join a growing number of facilities rejecting the video over concerns it violates a 1939 law known as the Hatch Act, which limits partisan political activities for federal workers.
The Port Authority also oversees Teterboro Airport.
Tuesday marks the 14th day of the government shutdown, which was caused by a partisan rift over competing measures to continue funding the government’s operations. Many federal employees are furloughed, while others, like air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay until a deal is reached.
The Trump administration continued on Tuesday to pin the blame for the shutdown on Democrats.
“The Trump Administration won’t shy away from sharing the truth with the American people: Democrats shut down the government because they want to give free health care to illegal aliens — and Americans are suffering as a result. Democrats could reopen the government at any point,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.
Democrats deny that their plan to reopen the government includes free health care for undocumented immigrants. They argue they are withholding support of a GOP plan because it does not extend federal subsidies for health care plans purchased on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, largely echoed Noem’s script in a statement Tuesday.
“It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,” McLaughlin said. “Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
A spokesman for Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, deferred comment to the Port Authority. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said New York officials are “focused on keeping the flying public safe – and that means not playing political ads in our airports.”
“When Kristi Noem isn’t busy trying to defund the police in New York, she’s apparently hard at work subjecting travelers to obviously false and nakedly partisan messaging,” she said in a statement.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)The Florida Supreme Court refused Monday to force the Florida Bar to investigate U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for alleged state ethics violations, denying a request made by dozens of attorneys and former judges.
The court’s five-sentence rejection sided with the Florida Bar — the overseer of the state’s legal profession — and state Attorney General James Uthmeier in finding that the 70-odd legal experts lacked standing to ask a state-level organization to investigate federal officials, even if they’re certified to practice law in Florida.
“Because petitioner has failed to show a clear legal right to the relief requested, he is not entitled to mandamus relief,” the brief denial reads, co-signed by five of the seven Florida Supreme Court Justices.
“I’m glad to report that the Florida Supreme Court rejected the attempted partisan lawfare against @AGPamBondi. Case dismissed,” Uthmeier celebrated on social media. In September, his office had filed a brief defending Bondi and excoriating the petitioners for trying to force the Florida Bar to investigate her.
Florida Supreme Court justices, via the court
Bondi, 59, served as attorney general for Florida from 2010 through 2018. In November 2024, she became one of a host of Floridians tapped by President Donald Trump to serve in his administration. Bondi was confirmed as U.S. attorney general in February and, as the head of the Department of Justice, she’s been in lockstep with Trump in cracking down on immigration, pushing to expand the death penalty, and working to prosecute former enemies.
But her role hasn’t come without controversy.
Jon May vs The Florida Bar
In June, South Florida defense attorney Jon May filed a complaint with the Florida Bar asking for an investigation into Bondi, accusing the DOJ chief of abusing her power by firing or forcing resignations of federal attorneys.
In his complaint alleging ethics violations, May pointed to three instances, the Miami Herald reported: In February, multiple federal prosecutors in New York and Washington resigned after refusing to follow a DOJ order to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.
Weeks later, another federal prosecutor resigned rather than carry out orders from Trump officials to pursue charges that she claimed were not supported by evidence. In April, Bondi fired an immigration lawyer accused of “sabotaging” the Trump administration’s case over Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador.
May said these examples showed that Bondi “ordered Department lawyers to do things those lawyers were ethically forbidden from doing, under threat of suspension or termination — or fired them for not having done so.”
Still, the Florida Bar dismissed May’s complaint a day after he filed it, noting that the organization doesn’t “investigate or prosecute sitting officers appointed under the U.S. Constitution while they are in office.”
So May, joined by roughly 70 other attorneys, scholars, and former judges — including two retired Florida Supreme Court justices — took his case to the Florida Supreme Court in July. He asked the justices to issue a writ of mandamus to the Florida Bar — a court order forcing a official or agency to do its job — to investigate the complaint against Bondi.
Florida’s legal officers, headed by DeSantis-appointee Uthmeier, pushed back on May’s case as an example of “partisan lawfare” in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the Florida Bar.

You can’t have the Land of Enchantment without the public lands that define New Mexico. As a born-and-raised Burqueño, I’m proud to celebrate Albuquerque’s recent leadership in public lands protection, especially as these critical spaces are under attack from the Trump administration.
Access to world-class protected places like the Petroglyph National Monument, Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, and the Sandia Mountain Wilderness have defined my life — from my career, to my childhood, and even my romance. As a young child, I was inspired to pursue a career in environmental science while out on hikes in the Sandia mountains with siblings, friends, parents, and grandparents. As a former environmental educator, I had the joy of taking the next generation of environmental stewards to study wildlife at Valle de Oro. And I met my soulmate at Petroglyph National Monument, where we deepened our love for a protected place while falling in love with each other.
When the Trump Administration announced its plans to sell-off public lands in New Mexico and across the country to the highest bidder (i.e., private developers and Big Oil and Gas), it was a personal issue. I know I’m not alone in this fight — a recent national poll shows 71% of voters nationwide oppose public lands sell-off. In early October, Albuquerque City Council unanimously passed a Public Lands Memorial to protect the public lands in the greater Albuquerque area from sell-off and development. My gratitude and congratulations go out to the Council, especially Councilor Tammy Fiebelkorn, who led this effort. Making the decision to protect public lands in the Greater Albuquerque area is an investment in the future of our community. Annually, New Mexico’s public lands contribute $3 billion to our state economy through public recreation, and support 30,000 jobs across the state.
Taking steps to protect and fund the stewardship of Albuquerque’s lands supports critical habitat corridors for endangered species and beloved migratory birds such as the sandhill crane. Keeping lands public and protected supports more accessible, affordable spaces for families in Albuquerque to get outside. In protecting its public lands, Albuquerque plays an important role in strengthening recreational and cultural connectivity between southern New Mexico’s world-class national parks and monuments – like White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns, the Gila Wilderness, and the Organ Mountains, with international ski destinations like those in the Santa Fe and Carson national forests. By the way, these are all public lands, which will remain under threat by an increasingly overreaching Trump administration.
Just this past summer, thousands of New Mexicans joined together in Santa Fe to protest Trump’s Secretary of the Interior — the federal agency responsible for stewardship of public lands — for being Trump’s enforcer on rolling back protections for public lands. In the right hands, like former Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, this agency can help guide the stewardship of public lands to reflect the cultural, recreational, environmental and many other benefits of public lands. However, while the Trump administration turns its back on these values, local municipalities and states’ governments can provide support to ensure public hands remain protected.

“We’re proud to help Delaware homeowners take advantage of these federal incentives before
they disappear,” said Ben Boyce Sr., owner of Aire Serv Heating and Air. “Heat pumps have
come a long way—they’re reliable, efficient, and environmentally responsible. This is the perfect
time for families to upgrade, lower their monthly bills, and enjoy greater comfort year-round. At
Aire Serv, our mission has always been to serve our neighbors with expertise, honesty, and
care. We’re here to make sure no homeowner misses this opportunity.”
Why Heat Pumps Are a Smart Upgrade
Modern heat pumps—either as all-electric systems or in hybrid (dual-fuel) setups—are gaining
popularity for good reason. They transfer heat rather than generate it, which often leads to
efficiency ratings of 200–300%. In contrast, even the best gas furnaces lose energy through
exhaust. The improved reliability, quieter operation, and reduced environmental impact make
heat pumps a compelling option for many homeowners.
Tax Incentives: What You Need to Know:

The federal 25C credit covers 30% of qualifying project cost, capped at $2,000 for
heat pump installations placed in service by Dec. 31, 2025. DNREC+2Delaware DNREC

Across the U.S. military, climate change isn’t a distant threat. It’s a daily challenge. The fallout from a warming planet has hit the military hard, sidelining more than 10,000 troops since 2018, flooding bases and undermining everything from runways to nuclear readiness.
Extreme weather is battering installations from Guam to North Carolina and fueling instability in regions overseas where American forces may be called to intervene.
For decades, the Pentagon viewed climate change as a national security threat — not for environmental reasons, but because it undermined operations and readiness. 
Now the Trump administration is dismantling that approach. Pentagon leaders have cut climate research funding and abandoned adaptation plans. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed global warming concerns as “climate change crap.” 
Critics warn that the military is being forced to fly blind — and that the cost could be strategic vulnerability in a world where climate is increasingly shaping conflict.
“I think it puts our troops at risk,” said Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security. “… We’re going to be less prepared if our troops are deployed somewhere where it’s incredibly hot and their equipment doesn’t work right, or if they themselves can’t physically operate … That’s malpractice, I think.”
The Defense Department did not respond to Floodlight’s requests for public documents and an interview to discuss changes to its climate policy.
The Pentagon’s 2026 budget request recommends cutting $1.6 billion in “wasteful” climate spending. Among the targeted programs: a $6 million grant to decarbonize emissions from Navy ships. Where most of the remaining cuts would come from is unclear.
That marked a sharp break from the previous administration, when the Department of Defense sought $5 billion for climate initiatives in its fiscal 2024 budget — including efforts to harden bases against extreme weather and reduce battlefield fuel dependence.

How warming undermines U.S. military power
In September 2018, Hurricane Florence dumped 36 inches of rain on Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, creating a 13-foot storm surge and damaging more than 3,000 homes at the Marine Corps base and nearby air stations.
Just a month later, Hurricane Michael struck Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida with 160 mph winds, flipping fighter jets and damaging more than 600 buildings. The branch spent nearly $5 billion to repair and upgrade the base to become more resilient to future storms. 
And in May 2023, Typhoon Mawar slammed Andersen Air Force base in Guam with 140 mph winds and 28 inches of rain. The storm upended cars, took out power lines and damaged nearly 500 buildings. It cost nearly $10 billion to repair and to harden the base against future extreme weather events. 
According to the National Weather Service, unusually warm ocean temperatures supercharged all three storms.

These aren’t isolated events. Rising seas are projected to cause chronic flooding at coastal military bases in the coming decades. By 2050, half of coastal bases could each face 270 or more flood events each year, according to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Major storms can hobble nuclear deterrence, too. Hurricanes could damage submarines or delay the transport of nuclear warheads, warned researcher Jamie Kwong, a fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. All three nuclear delivery systems — air, land and water — could be hampered by climate change, she said. 
Training and lives at risk
Since 2022, the U.S. military has been deployed to more than 230 climate emergencies, according to the nonprofit Center for Climate and Security. 
Much of that work has fallen to the National Guard. Over the past decade, the National Guard put in nearly 4 million days of service responding to hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, the Pentagon said in a recent report to four Democratic U.S. senators who had requested the information.
And heat-related illnesses among troops are climbing. From 2020 to 2024, the annual rate of heat exhaustion among service members jumped 52%. In 2024 alone, troops suffered more than 2,800 heat-related illnesses. 
Fort Benning has long had a problem with excessive heat. Stretching across 182,000 hot and muggy acres in west-central Georgia straddling the Alabama state line, it’s one of the Army’s top training centers — and it has recorded more heat-related illnesses than any other U.S. military base. Until about a decade ago, someone there was dying from the heat every three years.
That crisis led to the 2019 creation of the U.S. Army’s Heat Center at Fort Benning, where military personnel are taught how to prevent and treat heat-related illnesses.
Officers there developed techniques like arm immersion — lowering soldiers’ arms into cold water during training breaks to reduce body temperature — and ice sheeting, where frozen bed sheets are wrapped around overheated troops to bring down body heat quickly.

To reduce the risk of heat illnesses, the military generally suspends nonessential outdoor activities on extremely hot days. One such instance occurred in August, when a heat wave gripping the Korean Peninsula forced U.S. and South Korean forces to postpone half of their field training exercises.
These so-called “black flag” days— generally 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above —  are becoming more common at many military bases, according to a 2023 Defense Department report. 
As global temperatures rise, the military may have to suspend summer training at its hottest bases and “spend a heck of a lot of money” to relocate that training, predicts Caroline Baxter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for education and training under the Biden administration.
It’s not just troops who suffer. Military planes and ships are affected, too. Hot, humid air is less dense, which means planes struggle to generate the lift they need and can’t carry as much cargo. In fact, a 2019 Climate and Security brief warns that hotter, more humid air will force military aircraft to reduce payloads — or abandon missions entirely. 
During the 2016 raid to capture Osama bin Laden, one of the Black Hawk helicopters sustained severe damage during a hard landing. President Barack Obama emphasized the impact that the hot temperature had on the incident.
Warm seawater, meanwhile, makes it harder to cool ship engines, while melting glaciers dilute ocean salinity, which can compromise the effectiveness of sonar. 
As the world warms, it’s bringing more droughts and food shortages to fragile areas, contributing to problems that threaten national security interests, the U.S. Army said in its 2022 climate strategy document. 
Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who led the military response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, noted that drought caused by global warming helped trigger the 2011 Syrian civil war and the later armed conflict in Sudan. He has since founded the Green Army, an organization that fights toxic pollution in Louisiana.
“You can change your policy to not consider the impact of global warming on your strategic posture,” Honoré said, “but … the heat will cause a disruption to global stability as well as security. And it will continue to have a human impact on our day-to-day training and operational readiness.”
Melting Arctic ice also increases the potential for military conflict, experts say, because it’s opening up shipping lanes that were once inaccessible. Contested economic and military activities between Russia and other Arctic nations “will increase the risk of miscalculation,” a 2023 threat assessment by the U.S. Intelligence Community warned.
“What that really means is there is an accident waiting to happen,” according to “Threat Multiplier,” a book by Sherri Goodman, who as deputy undersecretary of defense led the military’s environmental efforts during the Clinton administration. 
Mission over emissions
For more than 25 years, the U.S. military planned for climate change.
The Department of Defense developed its first climate change strategy in 1998 and a decade later declared global warming a national security issue. After Joe Biden took office, the military’s focus on climate impacts took on new urgency.
“Climate change is an existential threat to our nation’s security,” then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in 2021, “and the Department of Defense must act swiftly and boldly to take on this challenge and prepare for damage that cannot be avoided.” 
For the Pentagon, climate change wasn’t just about the environment — it was about how and where troops could operate.
“How do I continue to do my job despite the fact that the operational environment is changing?” said John Conger, a former high-ranking Defense Department official who later ran the Center for Climate and Security. “ …You’re not thinking about emissions, you’re thinking about missions.”
In 2022, the U.S. Army began rolling out its first hybrid tactical vehicles. There was a practical reason for that, too: Hybrids are quieter and consume less fuel, which can save lives in combat.
“We were losing marines and soldiers in the constant movement of fuel to the front in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Goodman wrote in her book. “For every 24 fuel convoys in Afghanistan, one soldier was killed.”
Some Pentagon projects aimed at boosting effectiveness and efficiency have also spun off climate-friendly civilian innovations. For example, the military’s work with General Motors on hydrogen fuel cells produced fast-charging, off-grid power units that could speed electric car charging.

New doctrine: Climate doesn’t matter anymore
President Donald Trump has pushed to rechristen the Department of Defense as the “Department of War.” And  Hegseth has made it clear that the Pentagon’s priorities have shifted.
“The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap,” he wrote in a March posting on X. “We do training and warfighting.” 
On March 17, Hegseth issued a memo banning Pentagon agencies from spending money on climate planning and ordering leaders to “remove all references to climate change and related subjects from mission statements.”
Hegseth doubled down on his message in his Sept. 30 address to hundreds of military leaders at Quantico, declaring there would be “no more climate change worship” in the U.S. military.
The secretary’s March directive does leave room for the continuation of some weather-related work, including risk assessments, environmental reviews and base resilience improvements.
But the Pentagon also announced it’s canceling 91 studies focused on climate and social science research. The move will save $30 million — a tiny fraction of the department’s $850 billion budget. That research was designed to help military planners anticipate emerging security threats, including climate change, extremism and disinformation. 
‘We’re not going to be ready’
Cutting those grants is short-sighted, says Tom Ellison, deputy director of the Center for Climate and Security. His group, working with Virginia Tech, was slated to get $2 million to study how rising seas and extreme weather could fuel instability in the Philippines, Guam and Japan — regions important to U.S. strategy in the Indo-Pacific. But in March, they learned the grant was canceled.
“These research projects answer key questions about not just climate change, but a variety of issues shaping the world in which the US military operates, including migration, technology, ideology, public opinion, etc.” Ellison wrote in an email to Floodlight. 
“Moreover,” he added, “they do it for relative pennies,” noting the Pentagon spends $30 million “roughly every 20 minutes.” 
Climate action plans from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have quietly disappeared from public websites in recent months. The Pentagon also shut down its climate resilience portal. 
Baxter, the former deputy assistant defense secretary, helped build that portal, which she called a vital hub for validated climate data. 
Said Conger, the former Center for Climate and Security director: “If you do not have complete information because you willfully ignore certain parts of the puzzle, you put yourself at a disadvantage — because the Russians and the Chinese aren’t ignoring it.”
Sikorsky, the center’s current director, agreed. 
“It sends a message to our competitors and adversaries … ‘We’re going to be weak because we’re not going to be ready.’”

Perfect fall weather sets the stage for thousands of walkers uniting across Delaware in 5K Walks to celebrate health, friendship, and community impact
WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 14, 2025) — With crisp fall air, clear skies, and golden leaves setting the scene, Delawareans are preparing to step into a weekend filled with purpose — joining thousands across the state for a series of 5Ks and charity walks that combine fitness, fun, and compassion.
For Glen Gray of Wilmington, this weekend’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s is personal. Gray has gathered friends and family to honor several loved ones affected by the disease. “This is one of those weekends where a small step can have a huge impact,” Gray said. “You don’t have to be a runner or an athlete — just showing up helps your neighbors, your friends, and your community in ways that truly matter.”
That sense of community connection extends across Delaware, from Smyrna to Lewes. “Every October, we see new faces who start by walking one mile and end up volunteering year-round,” said McKenzie Blithe from the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition. “It all starts with the first step — that’s how awareness grows, and that’s how lives are changed.”
From the purple Promise Gardens of Wilmington’s Riverfront to the garden paths of Smyrna and the sand trails of Cape Henlopen, more than 5,000 Delaware residents are expected to take part in at least five major events between Saturday and Sunday, October 18–19 — walking for causes that touch nearly every family in the First State.

Wilmington’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s: A Sea of Purple for a Powerful Cause
The highlight of the weekend will be Wilmington’s Walk to End Alzheimer’s, one of Delaware’s most emotional and unifying events, where caregivers, advocates, and families come together to honor loved ones and advance the search for a cure.
Set for Saturday, October 18, at Tubman Garrett Riverfront Park, the event already boasts over 750 registered participants and 127 teams, with fundraising nearing $180,000 toward a $283,000 goal.
The morning begins with registration at 8:00 a.m., followed by the Promise Garden Ceremony at 9:00 a.m., where participants hold colored flowers representing their connection to the disease — blue for those living with Alzheimer’s, yellow for caregivers, purple for those who’ve lost someone, and orange for supporters.
“This is a community that refuses to give up hope,” said a spokesperson for the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter. “Every step taken, every flower lifted, represents a promise to keep fighting for a world without Alzheimer’s.”
Funds raised will support local caregiver programs, education and outreach services, and Alzheimer’s research. Walkers can still register, volunteer, or donate online.

Communities Across Delaware Join In
While Wilmington’s Riverfront glows purple on Saturday, the spirit of giving will echo throughout Delaware as multiple charity walks and 5Ks bring together families, friends, and co-workers to support causes that make lasting change.

Cody Balmer, the Harrisburg man accused of firebombing the Governor’s Residence in April as Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests slept inside, pleaded guilty to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism on Tuesday.
Balmer, 38, will serve a total sentence of 25 to 50 years. He’ll be eligible for parole in 2050 when he is 63 years old.
Balmer, who confessed to police when he was arrested hours after starting the fire, said that he disagreed with Shapiro’s position on the Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed more than 1,100 people. Balmer said he had planned to kill Shapiro with a hammer he carried as he broke into the residence.
All 22 people who were in the residence, including Shapiro, his family, and guests celebrating the Passover holiday, were evacuated safely. All were asleep save two state troopers who were on guard.
Balmer also pleaded guilty to 46 other charges, including aggravated arson, burglary and the reckless endangerment of 22 individuals, including children between the ages of 8 and 16.
Dauphin County District Attorney Fran Chardo said in a press conference after the hearing, “I think it was the right sentence based on, thankfully, that no one was hurt or killed … The fact that it was by guilty plea, that’s a good thing.”
Video evidence played in court, captured by security cameras around the Governor’s Residence, showed Balmer breaking a window with a sledge hammer and throwing a Molotov cocktail into the home. Balmer then broke a second window and entered the residence.
Judge Deborah Curcillo called the video evidence “horrific.”
Chardo said in court that Balmer then tried to break down multiple doors in the home, including one with people sleeping behind it. When he was unable to move further into the residence, he set off a second molotov cocktail and fled the grounds.
The incident occurred early in the morning of April 13, the first night of the Jewish Passover holiday.
Balmer called 911 and turned himself in shortly after the attack. He cited Shapiro’s stance on the war in Gaza between Israel and the militant group Hamas as his motivation for the attack.
According to Chardo, this motivation, along with Blamer’s confession that he intended to kill Shapiro with a sledge hammer if he had found him, was the basis for the terrorism enhancement to the attempted murder charge, doubling the sentence.
Shapiro is the highest-ranking Jewish official in Pennsylvania.
Chardo read a letter from Shapiro and his wife, First Lady Lori Shapiro, in court. The letter said that Shapiro and his family have been left with a “nagging sense of fear,” which has manifested in trouble sleeping and anxiety while in public.
“Time has now separated between before the fire and after the fire,” the letter said. “It’s a fear and anxiety we are learning to live with, but we are expecting to carry with us for a lifetime.”
Mary Clapp, one of the public defenders representing Balmer in court, read a letter from Balmer’s family.
It described Balmer as a loving father and active community member who had struggled with mental illness in the time before the attack on the Governor’s Residence. The letter said Balmer’s family had tried to get him committed in the days ahead of the incident, but the request was denied because he was not considered an immediate danger.
“While Cody’s actions can not be excused, they can only be understood” through the lens of mental illness, the letter said. Members of Balmer’s family were present for the hearing.
Chardo confirmed a police call was made and that did not result in involuntary commitment.
“Our mental health procedures act is an old one. It’s more than 40 years old,” Chardo said. “We need to figure out how to deal with that in a better way so that people are not getting their treatment for mental health by being stuck in jails.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-14-at-10.23.33 AM.png,,,2025-10-14 11:59:43.392807
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-14 15:08:30+00:00,CT Mirror,Darien outlines plans to boost affordable housing,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/14/darien-affordable-housing-fairfield-county/,The town is trying to set an example for surrounding Fairfield County communities on ways to increase affordable housing stock responsibly.,"Over the last 15 years several apartment buildings that incorporate affordable housing and retail space were constructed in downtown Darien, but local officials say there is still room for improvement.
The town is trying to set an example for surrounding Fairfield County communities on ways to increase affordable housing stock responsibly.
One of the main ways towns can work to increase affordable housing is by giving financially to a project, according to Evonne Klein, with the Fairfield County Center for Housing Opportunity.
“What towns can contribute is critically important, because you want as much money as possible to go into the units and not into parking or not into fees,” Klein said.
Financial assistance can come from grant funding or a local affordable housing trust fund in lieu of constructing affordable units, Klein said.
Klein is also the former chief executive officer of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness. She also once served as Commissioner of the state’s Department of Housing.
Klein led a walk through several housing developments near Darien’s Metro-North train station Thursday, highlighting developments constructed within roughly the last 15 years.
Communities along the New Haven rail line have the unique opportunity to develop transit-oriented, walkable communities around the train stations, Klein said.
“I’m proud that Darian is able to do that and offer people of all incomes, and hopefully more of all incomes, housing choice,” Klein said. “Not just homeownership opportunities, because most of our municipalities are single family homes, they’ve been zoned for single family homes. So more and more we’ve had more approvals of multifamily projects, some with affordable on-site.”
Darien’s affordability requirement says affordable units must be available at 80% of the State Median Income (SMI), as opposed to the more commonly used Area Median Income (AMI). Using SMI instead makes the units more accessible to a range of income levels, Klein said.
At those rates, a single income household must earn no more than about $64,000 to qualify for an affordable apartment, Klein said. Two- and three-person households must earn no more than about $83,000 and $103,000, respectively, to qualify.
Four percent of Darien’s housing stock is considered affordable, which is still below the state mandate requiring towns and cities to make 10% of their housing stock affordable.
“We also want to build housing that is affordable,” Steve Olvany, chairman of Darien’s Planning and Zoning Commission, said. “That’s why I don’t want all the two bedrooms or three bedrooms torn down. There’s people that want to bulldoze those neighborhoods, which we just walked down, and put up townhouses and put affordable housing.”
However, there’s still work to be done in Darien to increase housing options, particularly for people who may earn too much to qualify for an affordable apartment, but too little to be able to purchase a home in Fairfield County, according to Olvany.
“You’re a recent college graduate. You cannot afford a house that is $800,000. You don’t make that much money,” Olvany said. “They don’t necessarily want to live in apartments, so you need to build affordable housing, and housing that is affordable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSCN7127.jpg,,,2025-10-14 11:59:43.392807

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Kansas’ health ranking had one of the steepest declines in the nation in the past 30 years, according to a study that sought to identify potential reasons and fixes for the state’s downward slide.
One hundred experts determined that Kansas’ lack of a coherent policy agenda, income disparities and fragile, underfunded health care systems have contributed to the state dropping from eighth in the country in 1991 to 28th in 2024.
“Kansas’ health ranking decline reflects deeply rooted structural and cultural dynamics, not simply individual behaviors or programmatic gaps. Turning the tide will require a fundamental shift in how health is prioritized and pursued,” said four authors who recently published reports through the Kansas Health Institute under the title, “What Happened to Health in Kansas?”
The institute surveyed health professionals, academics, advocates, community organizations and public health, state and local government officials and analyzed their responses after three rounds of questionnaires to identify a collective consensus.
That consensus contained insight into the reasons for Kansas’ ill health and why leadership is the most direct way to fix it.
“Kansas is one of only 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid, and not surprisingly, nine of those 10 states fall in the bottom half of the rankings,” one participant said in the report.
The report cited rural hospital closures, the lack of Medicaid expansion, limited mental health services and low public health funding as the highest priorities to resolve. Next, participants said chronic disease, obesity, wealth inequality, workforce shortages, housing access, absence of a culture of health, and piecemeal systems were also identified as key priorities to address the state’s health dip.
The decline also can be attributed, in part, to lower than average levels of physical activity, higher than average smoking and a higher than average teen birth rate, according to America’s Health Rankings, a platform under the United Health Foundation.
“While downstream conditions such as chronic disease, obesity and related risk factors were rated as important, participants placed greater emphasis on the upstream and midstream policy and infrastructure conditions that influence these outcomes,” the report said. “This suggests that stakeholders perceive many of Kansas’ downstream health challenges as symptoms of broader systemic issues, particularly insufficient access to care, underinvestment in public health capacity and fragmentation across sectors.”
Another survey participant characterized the cultural norms surrounding health care in Kansas: “There’s a whole ideology built around the idea that people’s circumstances are the direct result of their behavior, their choices and their fundamental goodness or badness.”
In the report, the authors — who are Kevin Kovach, Emma Uridge, Viktoria Sterkhova and Wen-Chieh Lin — acknowledge that Kansas’ health ranking was declining before Medicaid expansion was an option. They concluded that Kansas’ health systems need strong leadership.
“But this is not leadership as authority or position,” they wrote. “It is leadership as practice focused on engaging others to co-create change through action, learning and shared meaning making.”
The Kansas Health Foundation is positioning itself to embody that kind of leadership.
Despite the state’s declining well-being, the health rankings platform featured the Kansas Health Foundation as a prime example for approaching health holistically while using data to focus on the root causes of health problems, such as social and economic factors.
“Data holds you accountable. The point of measuring something is to create pressure to do something,” said Ed O’Malley, president and CEO of the foundation, in a Sep. 29 news release.
The foundation is a Wichita-based nonprofit that funds the Topeka-based Kansas Health Institute, along with other health-focused organizations.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2176362473-scaled-1-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-10-14 10:57:33.713932

(University of Kentucky photo)Beloved Kentucky writer Gurney Norman, whose fiction chronicled life in Appalachia and the 1960s counterculture, died Oct. 12. He was 88.
Norman taught and mentored generations of aspiring writers as the University of Kentucky’s director of creative writing and a professor of English. 
He was Kentucky’s poet laureate and the recipient of many awards and honors including an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Berea College and an affiliation with novelist Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters.
Norman’s legacy — “the tail of his comet” — will live on in “all the writers to whom he’s been tremendously influential,” said Willie Davis, a writer in Lexington and creative writing teacher at Kentucky State University. “He was kind and generous with his time.”
Davis said reading Norman’s work, especially “Kinfolks,” opened his eyes by depicting Appalachia in ways more alive and vivid than common stereotypical treatments. “He writes with such precision. His characters are so full of life. It really enraptured me. I told him if everyone wrote about a mountain like you write about a mountain, no one would ever tear another mountain down.”
 Gurneyfest
In the fall of 2023, Norman’s fans, friends and scholars gathered at UK for a two-day Gurneyfest that included music, readings, discussions and a screening of “The Wilgus Stories,” a trilogy of short films starring Ned Beatty and otherwise unknown actors adapted from the short story collection “Kinfolks.” 
Published in 1977 and told through the eyes of young Wilgus Collier, a coal miner’s son, the stories illuminate “the universal experiences of love, loss, and finding one’s way in the world,” says a KET description.
In an interview in 2001 with KET producer Guy Mendes, Norman, who was born in Grundy, Virginia, remembered growing up between two sets of grandparents, one in southwestern Virginia, one near Hazard in the Perry County coal camp of Allais.
His mother was a teacher and his father a coal miner who exposed him to books and ideas.
“I remember enjoying so much hanging around with my dad on days off with all his buddies, these miners. And they would all be clean and have on a nice clean shirt, and they were enjoying being out in the sunshine. And their talk was … It was excellent, it was wonderful. I could listen forever. And the best part about it for me was the humor,” Norman told Mendes.
“I remember a hundred times, probably, these friends of my dad’s — you know, I was like 4 and 5 and 6 years old — but one of his buddies every now and then would grab the seat of my pants, and he would say, ‘Well, I can tell you’re going to be a miner by the slack in your pants.’ And this was a kind of teasing that was very benign. But I just remember everybody being articulate and very creative with language.”
Norman said he knew from age 15 — the year his father died — that he wanted to be a writer. “You know, that was an emotional upset. I don’t think I showed it, but I remember soon after he died I just felt this need to write stories.” He received some encouragement from a teacher and also wrote for his high school newspaper and yearbook.

‘Kentucky Fab Five’
Arriving at the University of Kentucky in 1955, he first majored in journalism, writing a satirical column for the student newspaper, the Kentucky Kernel, before gravitating to literature and the English department where he studied with professors Hollis Summers Jr.  and Robert Hazel.
Also studying creative writing at UK and striking up lifelong friendships with Norman and each other were soon-to-be acclaimed Kentucky writers Wendell Berry, the late Ed McClanahan and the late James Baker Hall.
“They were exciting times. It was a time of ferment,” Norman recalled.
Bobie Ann Mason, who would become a bestselling novelist, also was a student in the UK English department. They came to be known as the “Kentucky Fab Five” for their literary accomplishments. 
On Friday nights, Norman recalled, the Paddock Club on the corner of Euclid and Rose streets, “was the most interesting and fabulous quasi-Bohemian place that you could find — based not on espresso, but on beer.” 
In 1960, Norman received a Wallace Stegner Fellowship in Creative Writing at Stanford University where he studied with literary critic Malcolm Cowley and the Irish short story writer Frank O’Connor.
At Stanford, Norman and McClanahan became friends with Ken Kesey, also studying creative writing, and soon to be author of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Sometimes a Great Notion.”
‘Divine Right’s Trip’
While Kesey gained fame for an LSD-fueled cross-country trip in an old bus from his home in Oregon, Norman wrote about a fictional journey from California to a Kentucky mountain farm in “Divine Right’s Trip: A Novel of the Counterculture,” published in 1971 by Stewart Brand in The Last Whole Earth Catalog.
The novel follows “Divine Right (D. R.) Davenport, a restless young man on a journey of self-discovery, as he embarks on a cross-country road trip in his beloved but unreliable old Volkswagen bus, Urge,” according to a description by Ohio University Press.
Brand, who was Norman’s neighbor in Menlo Park, California, paid him a monthly stipend of $300 to write the novel. “In the ’60s one could live a happy life on that,” Norman told Dee Davis in a 20221 interview in The Daily Yonder.
“Divine Right’s Trip,” the Gnomon Press version. (Ohio University Press)
“And so, I sat down and started making up a story right out of … I don’t know, I just started making it up. And when the chips are down and someone says here’s an opportunity, ‘Just make it up.’ Well, you just start making it up. And it helped that I myself had become a kind of alternative person and had had certain visionary experiences.”
“Divine Right’s Trip” was later published by the Dial Press, Bantam Books and Gnomon Press. 
Along the way Norman, who had been in ROTC, served two years in the U.S. Army; was a reporter for the Hazard Herald in Kentucky, and staffed a fire tower in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, before joining the English faculty at UK in 1979.
He was inducted into the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame in 2019.
His nonfiction includes “Confronting Appalachian Stereotypes: Back Talk from an American Region” written with Dwight B. Billings and Katherine Ledford, published by the University Press of Kentucky, and “An American Vein: Critical Readings in Appalachian Literature” with Danny Miller and Sharon Hatfield published by the Ohio University Press.
Other fiction includes “Book One From Crazy Quilt: A Novel in Progress” published by  Larkspur Press and “Ancient Creek: A Folktale” published by Old Cove Press, a Lexington publishing house founded by Nyoka Hawkins, Norman’s wife of 29 years.
Hawkins, in announcing Norman’s death Monday on Facebook, wrote, “Gurney’s spirit was so vast, so powerful and affirming, he will never leave us. We have his words, his stories and his books, the gift of his brilliant and graceful writing. 
“But his presence in the world, his essence, his being, was so much larger than books. He was a force of generous, irresistible love that a hundred books could never contain. I feel him here with me now as I write this, urging me on with those amazing blue eyes and powerful smile.”
Hawkins said his health challenges had mounted in the last four months and that “he went peacefully, no pain, no struggle.”
She said a memorial and celebration of Gurney Norman’s life will be held later this year.

The Deep South Today Investigative Reporting Center will launch in early 2026 with a lead investigative editor, dedicated full-time investigative and data reporters, and New York Times Local Investigations Fellows at Mississippi Today and Verite News. It will also include support from Big Local News, a program at Stanford University that empowers journalists with data, tools and collaborations. As the Deep South Today network of newsrooms continues to grow, the Deep South Today Investigative Reporting Center will add capacity in its new newsrooms with dedicated reporters and fellows.
“The Deep South Today newsrooms are already publishing impactful and award-winning investigative reporting, and our new Investigative Reporting Center in collaboration with The New York Times Local Investigations Fellowship will dramatically expand the breadth and depth of that work,” said Warwick Sabin, President and CEO of Deep South Today. “We developed Deep South Today to provide the infrastructure to sustain and grow local journalism in a region that is under-resourced and underserved, and this critically important initiative will advance our mission.”
The New York Times Local Investigations Fellowship is committing substantial resources in addition to the fellowship positions. Deputy Editor Chris Davis will manage the Deep South Today investigative team and the work will be co-published by Deep South Today newsrooms and The Times, and made available to local news organizations for co-publication. The Times will also lend staff time to help Deep South Today recruit, hire and train the editors and reporters who will be a part of their new investigative reporting center, as well as edit the stories being produced. Support from the Times will help fast-track Deep South Today’s ambitious goals to produce local beat coverage and investigative stories of importance to communities across the region. Additionally, the Local Investigations Fellowship will continue working with other newsrooms across the U.S. to produce original accountability journalism.
“Deep South Today has big ambitions for robust coverage of the South and building an investigative team is vital to that mission,” said Dean Baquet, former Executive Editor of The Times who now leads the Local Investigations Fellowship program. “We’ve already worked with Mississippi Today to much success and we look forward to doing more.”
Across the Deep South, the capacity of local and state newsrooms to produce resource-intensive, in-depth investigative reporting that exposes injustice and holds the powerful accountable is scarce. Local journalism is under attack on numerous fronts, and this initiative is being launched at a critical time when access to public information in the public interest is increasingly being restricted and accountability reporting is more challenging than ever to produce.
“This collaboration will redefine what’s possible for local journalism,” said Adam Ganucheau, Deep South Today’s Executive Editor and Chief Content Officer and a native Mississippian. “By combining the familiarity and trust of Deep South Today’s newsrooms with the resources and expertise of The New York Times, we’re building something truly unprecedented — a regional force for accountability and change. Together, we’re proving that the future of investigative reporting starts here, in communities that need it most.”
By working with The Times to launch and build out a new investigative reporting center, Deep South Today will position an upstart investigative team alongside some of the most prominent editors in the journalism industry. This initiative builds on the success that Mississippi Today already established with The Times and Big Local News: A joint investigation by those organizations about corruption and abuse by Mississippi sheriffs was a finalist for the 2024 Pulitzer Prize in Local Reporting and led to expanded federal investigations and legislative reforms in the state. Mississippi Today also separately won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting in 2023 for its investigative series “The Backchannel” and The Local Investigations Fellowship won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting in 2025 in collaboration with the Baltimore Banner and Big Local News for an investigation into the deadly opioid crisis.
“This collaboration is about more than just investigative journalism — it’s about building power through reporting in communities that have long been overlooked and where local newspapers are struggling to survive” said Terry Baquet, Verite News Editor-in-Chief and a Louisiana native. “We’re not just working together on stories; with The New York Times, we’re building a new model for how serious journalism can thrive in the South. It’s deeply personal to me, and I believe it is the future of local journalism.”
Integrating data journalism into the investigative teams and providing mentoring and training in computational methods with the support of Big Local News will level up the capacities of the Deep South Today newsrooms to uncover hidden patterns, provide sophisticated investigative coverage, and lower the cost of accountability reporting through better use of tools and algorithms.
“These resources mean Big Local News will be able to provide data journalism support to the Deep South reporters and editors that will further equip them to find and report out critical investigative stories,” said Cheryl Phillips, Founder and Co-Director of Big Local News. “I hope this work in the Deep South can serve as a model for how to scale local news.”
This initiative was made possible through a grant from Arnold Ventures, and Deep South Today and The Times view it as an opportunity to create a new sustainable, replicable model for building strong regional investigative teams that can produce high-impact local, state and regional stories in underserved communities.
All of the new positions for the Deep South Today Investigative Reporting Center will soon be posted on the Deep South Today website at: https://deepsouthtoday.org/careers

	APU’s Indigenous Peoples’ Day celebration combined festivities, food and education. There were dances, demonstrations of traditional Native sports, a buffet featuring salmon and reindeer stews, and educational booths hosted by artists and activists.
Phillip Blanchett, the musician and artist who emceed the event, took time to speak about the flood and storm damages in Western Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, his home region.
He asked the audience to think about the people who were missing or otherwise suffering from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, which lashed the region and caused record flooding and hurricane-force winds.
Blanchett, who is Yup’ik, was in his hometown of Bethel over the weekend. His band, Pamyua, played a benefit concert for the local public media station, KYUK, on Saturday night, just before the storm hit. He saw the water rising just before he was able to fly to Anchorage, he said.

Local people prepared the best they could, but it’s difficult to combat such a powerful natural disaster, he said. “In the Bush, everybody knows when a storm’s coming and what to do,” he said. However, “this storm was not a normal storm.”
Other speakers at the event, including APU President Janelle Vanasse, also expressed concerns about Western Alaska storm victims.
Alaska, which has the nation’s highest percentage of Indigenous residents, became one of the first states to officially recognize Indigenous People’s Day when then-Gov. Bill Walker signed a proclamation in 2015.
While state offices were not closed in observance, Anchorage municipal offices were, thanks to a 2023 ordinance making Indigenous Peoples’ Day and Juneteenth official holidays.
Among the other sites holding Indigenous Peoples’ Day events was the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

Those are the same charges that an unnamed juvenile arrested on Friday faces.
McGhee and the unnamed juvenile are both at the Montgomery County Detention Facility, according to police.

MPD said in a statement Tuesday morning that more arrests are anticipated. Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said in a statement Monday evening that that two arrests are a direct result of MPD and other law enforcements’ prioritization of the case. 
“The second arrest in last week’s downtown shooting is another step toward justice for the victims, their families and our city,” Reed said. “From the start, I promised that we would make it a priority to use all of the resources available to catch anyone who chose to fire into a crowd of innocent people. That promise stands.”
The shooting took place during celebrations following a football game in Montgomery on Oct. 4. Police said Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43, were killed in the shooting. 
As of last week, five of the injured had life-threatening injuries and seven had non-life-threatening injuries.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Most Indiana voters said the state is on the “wrong track” and expressed growing frustration with their political choices — including unfavorable views of top elected officials and both major parties — according to a new statewide poll released Tuesday.
The survey of 604 registered voters, conducted last week by North Star Opinion Research, on behalf of Independent Indiana, shows President Donald Trump, Gov. Mike Braun and Secretary of State Diego Morales all with negative favorability ratings.
Trump was viewed favorably by 42% of Hoosiers and unfavorably by 49%. Braun fared worse, with 24% favorable and 43% unfavorable, while 22% had no opinion and 11% had never heard of him.
Morales was viewed favorably by 5%; 17% unfavorable — with 21% offering no opinion and 57% saying they’d never heard of him.
Morales faces two Republican opponents already and Democrat Beau Bayh recently announced his candidacy for the office. Bayh has already raised $100,000 in large donations, including $50,000 from Michael Browning, a central Indiana developer. Morales had about $900,000 on hand when he filed his June 30 campaign finance report.
More than half of Hoosier respondents — including Republicans, Democrats and independents — were reportedly “dissatisfied” with the choices of candidates on their ballots in state elections, overall.
Story continues below.
OCT 14 — IN Statewide Survey Presentation
 
Fifty-three percent of all respondents said Indiana is on the “wrong track,” while just 34% believe Indiana is headed in the right direction.
Views were split along party lines, however: 63% of Republicans said Indiana is moving in the right direction, compared with only 28% of independents and 15% of Democrats.
The mixed-mode survey — which used a blend of live phone interviews and text-to-web responses — carries a margin of error of 3.99 percentage points.
Last week, Independent Indiana, which supports independent candidates throughout the state, released findings early on redistricting, finding that 53% of all respondents opposed drawing congressional maps early, compared with 34% who support it. Opposition cut across party lines, including among the GOP — 59% of Republican respondents said they support a mid-cycle map redraw, and 25% were opposed.
Republican lawmakers weigh whether to call a special session for redistricting, following Vice President JD Vance’s return visit to Indiana to rally support for the effort. Lawmakers are expected to discuss the proposal further this week.
Voters ‘dissatisfied’ with choices and parties
The results mark a continued cooling in Hoosiers’ opinions of top officials since Morning Consult carried out polling this summer, when Trump’s approval stood several points higher among Indiana voters, 
As of mid-August, 51% of Hoosiers approved of Trump while 45% disapproved, according to earlier polling.
Tuesday’s North Star survey additionally showed about half of Hoosier voters said they are “dissatisfied” with the choices of candidates available in Indiana elections — including 26% of Republicans, 71% of Democrats and 61% of independents.
Both state parties were viewed more negatively than positively. Just 33% view the Indiana Republican Party favorably (45% unfavorable), and 25% view the Indiana Democratic Party favorably (43% unfavorable).
Nearly 70% of survey respondents further said the two-party system “leaves out the views of too many people,” compared with just 21% who think it does a good job representing most Hoosiers.
Unite America poll shows more opposition to redistricting
Another new poll, released Monday by Unite America, also measured how Hoosiers view Indiana’s state and federal officials.
For example, Trump drew a 47% favorable rating overall, and a 78% favorable rating among Republicans, while Braun posted 32% favorable overall, with 53% of Republican respondents favorable.
The Indiana Legislature was viewed favorably 29% of all respondents, and 48% by Republicans; Morales was viewed favorably by 9% of all respondents, and 14% by Republicans; Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith was viewed favorably by 9% of all respondents, and 16% by Republicans; former Gov. Eric Holcomb was viewed favorably by 36% of all respondents, and 49% by Republicans; U.S. Sen. Todd Young was viewed favorably by 27% of all respondents, and 46% by Republicans; and U.S. Sen. Jim Banks was viewed favorably by 21% of all respondents, and 37% by Republicans.

Unite America also reported mounting resistance to redistricting.
The survey, conducted by 3D Strategic Research from Oct. 7–9, included 500 registered voters and 450 Republican primary voters. It found that 44% of Hoosiers oppose mid-decade redistricting, compared with 31% in support.
After respondents heard arguments from both sides, opposition jumped to 69%, with only 21% still in favor.
Just 10% of respondents overall — and 17% of GOP primary voters — said the governor and legislature should call a special session to redraw the maps.
“Voters across Indiana — including a majority of Republicans — are sick of partisan games that put party over country,” said Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America. “If lawmakers want to build trust, they’d be wise to focus on issues that directly affect Hoosiers’ everyday lives, instead of wasting taxpayer dollars to further gerrymander Indiana’s congressional districts, which are already among the least competitive in the country.”
The Unite America poll also found most voters oppose a GOP proposal to close Indiana’s primaries to registered party members only. Initially, 52% opposed the change, but after hearing arguments from both sides, opposition surged to 77% — including 66% of Republican primary voters.
“Every voter should have the freedom to cast a ballot in every taxpayer-funded election,” Troiano said. “I’m not surprised Indiana voters don’t want to give up that right.”

Facing federal c[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Mark Williams







FACING WAVES OF federal funding cuts, Massachusetts’s financial picture was already looking bleak as October approached. Legislative leaders warned of revenue slowdowns, universities and medical systems identified programs that could be cut or pared back, and the state attorney general’s office continued with a barrage of lawsuits against the Trump administration for grant cuts and immigration crackdowns. 
Then, of course, Congress entered a budget stalemate over expiring federal tax credits that have helped millions of Americans pay for health insurance. The resulting federal government shutdown is now approaching its third week. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith interviews Mark Williams, finance lecturer at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. Williams projected in April that the level of federal spending cuts and the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policy changes posed a specific danger to the state economy. It’s only gotten worse since then, Williams said. 
“The shutdown itself is interesting because it is just a layer that creates additional uncertainty in the economy of the state of Massachusetts, and then also the US economy and globally,” said Williams. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country are either furloughed or working without pay, which Williams noted has a knock-on effect.  
“Employees don’t get paid, they can’t spend,” he said. “If they can’t spend, the economy doesn’t grow. And if the economy doesn’t grow, GDP shrinks, and then of course eventually we have a recession.”  
Based on updated federal cuts under the tax bill passed on July 4, plus lingering effects if the shutdown drags on, Williams projects that the state could enter a recession by the third quarter of 2026 unless aggressive action is taken by lawmakers to pare back spending and rally behind the immigrant population essential to the state workforce.  
Even if the Legislature found an appetite to tap into the “rainy day fund,” which it is notoriously loath to do, Williams projects offsetting the federal cuts would rapidly and dangerously siphon state reserves. 
And the fate of the federal workforce in Massachusetts becomes less certain by the day. 
Just under 1 percent of Massachusetts’s workforce is either a civilian federal government employee or active military, Williams noted. On Friday, the Trump administration began to follow through on its threat to use the shutdown as a mechanism to lay off substantial numbers of federal workers. 
”We’ll be cutting very popular Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans,” President Trump said Thursday at the White House. The White House announced over the weekend that it identified Pentagon funds that could be shifted to pay military troops before they missed a paycheck on October 15. 
The federal workforce purges under the current Trump administration, beginning with the slash-and-burn tactics of the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency under the direction of Elon Musk, have made once reliable and essential jobs feel risky, Williams said. 
“It used to be that you’d go into sort of a federal job, and the pay wasn’t that great, but benefits were good and the stress was low,” he said. “And now it’s the opposite. Pay isn’t very good, it’s not predictable, and it’s quite risky to potentially lose your job without having any control over it.”  
On the episode, Williams discusses vulnerable Massachusetts workforces (3:45), political scrapping at the federal and state level (9:15), and what levers local officials could pull (20:15).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 09:57:50.143580

Now he's fighting for his freedom to sell cannabis. (Photo by Mike Mosedale/Minnesota Reformer)MAHNOMEN  — The day after Minnesota officially legalized recreational marijuana in August 2023, agents with the Paul Bunyan Drug Task Force raided a squat, single story cinderblock building across the railroad tracks from a grain elevator in the sleepy northwestern Minnesota town of Mahnomen.
The search of the Asema Tobacco & Pipe Shop yielded approximately 7.5 pounds of marijuana, much of it stored  in plain sight in mason jars bearing labels like “Black Plague” and “Ghost Candy.”  Investigators also seized just under a pound of marijuana wax and, from the till and several people who were present, $2,748 in cash. 
Eight months later,  Todd Jeremy Thompson, Asema’s owner, was charged by the Mahnomen County Attorney with one count of felony first-degree possession of marijuana. 
For Thompson, a blunt talking, occasionally profane 56-year-old enrolled member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, neither the raid nor the criminal case came as a surprise. 
“I was told by certain individuals that they were going to come. Two different sources,” Thompson told the Reformer during a pair of wide-ranging interviews at what he refers to as his “old school head shop.”
Still, those warnings did not dissuade Thompson from exercising what he believes are his rights under treaty law, applicable federal precedent, Minnesota’s 2023 cannabis legalization law, and the constitution of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. 
Thompson has a long history of successfully asserting his rights as a Native in the face of an array of legal authorities, but this constitutional clash is not without risk: He could face up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
In the more than two years that have passed since the raid, the retail sale of marijuana has exploded across Minnesota, first with a proliferation of tribally-owned dispensaries located on reservations,  and more recently, with a slew of tribal and non-tribal outlets opening off-reservation. 
At White Earth, Thompson explained as he gave a driving tour of Mahnomen, the band got a head start in the burgeoning industry because it already had a functional medical marijuana operation up and running. 
Rolling down the road, it’s hard to miss that enterprise, which is every bit as aromatic as you would guess. The growhouse is located in a 40,000-square-foot former potato chip factory, now encircled with tall fences and concertina wire. The tribally run dispensary, Waabigwan Mashkiki, is close too, just across the street from the Shooting Star Casino.
As his court case drags on, Thompson has continued to operate Asema, where products on display include bulk tobacco, incense, posters, and a wide array of paraphernalia: glassware, vapes, stash containers, cheap cigars, wraps, vape juice, scales and the like. 
Competition from the tribal dispensary has cut into his glassware sales, said Thompson. He’s still making enough to pay his bills, he said, adding ruefully that he probably won’t be in the market for a new truck any time soon.

In seeking dismissal of the felony charge, Thompson’s defense has hinged largely on a jurisdictional claim.
Under a 1953 law called Public Law 280, the U.S. Congress granted policing authority on Indian reservations to state law enforcement in six states, including Minnesota. But, broadly speaking, that authority does not extend to what are referred to as civil/regulatory matters. So when Minnesota legalized marijuana, the argument goes, the regulation of cannabis on reservations fell outside the purview of state courts.   
Thompson’s defense also points to the language of the 2023 state law that legalized recreational marijuana in Minnesota. That law explicitly “acknowledges the sovereign right of Minnesota Tribal governments to regulate the cannabis industry and address other matters of cannabis regulation [on reservations].”
Nonetheless, in March, District Court Judge Seamus Duffy rejected Thompson’s motion to dismiss. In his ruling, Duffy allowed that it was a close call but pointed out that Minnesota’s cannabis law still contains criminal provisions, including limits on allowable quantities and a prohibition on products such as marijuana wax.  
Duffy was less sympathetic to a second argument — that possession and sale of cannabis by Thompson and other band members is a reserved right under the 1855 treaty. Noting that the treaty is silent on the subject and that cannabis use among the Ojibwe is a relatively modern phenomenon, the judge wrote that “Thompson has not shown that marijuana was envisioned with any of the reserved rights at the time of the Treaty.”
The legal setback proved fleeting. 
In a highly unusual move, the Minnesota Court of Appeals agreed to take up Thompson’s appeal prior to the conclusion of the district court case. The grant of this interlocutory appeal typically signals a court’s view that the case raises a significant legal question. 
Oral arguments are scheduled for November 4. 
A history of standing up for Indigenous rights
The Asema raid is not the first time Thompson has found himself in legal crosshairs of state law enforcement. In the past decade, Thompson has been involved in long-running court cases that tested the bounds of state authority over netting fish and harvesting wild rice in the so-called “ceded territories” — land that the Ojibwe sold to the U.S. government in a series of 19th century treaties. 
After extensive legal wrangling, he came out on top both times. In the fishing case —brought after Thompson and a friend set gill nets in Gull Lake —  the Office of Crow Wing County Attorney dismissed the charge after a district court judge found that Thompson, as a White Earth band member, retained the right to fish on Gull Lake. (Thompson’s friend, a Fond du Lac band member, was convicted after the judge ruled that Fond du Lac band was not a signatory to the relevant treaty.)
Last spring, a different district court judge dismissed the ricing case after concluding that the state had violated Thompson’s right to a speedy trial by charging him, dismissing the charge after three months, and then re-charging eight months later.
Thompson also successfully rebuffed a trespass charge stemming from his participation in a 2021 protest over the construction of an oil pipeline, called Line 3, across the headwaters of the Mississippi River
In that fight, Thompson managed to get the case transferred to White Earth’s tribal court. In dismissing the charge, Tribal Court Judge David DeGroat ruled that Thompson’s actions were “in conformity with the goal of protecting environmental resources that impact ceded and reservations land.”
Thompson’s string of legal victories — and his willingness to put his neck on the line — has earned him admirers.
“Todd is out in front of most tribal members trying to figure out how to use treaty rights for economic benefit, whether it is standard hunt, fish and gather, or if it is something a step beyond,” said Frank Bibeau, a White Earth band member and an attorney for the 1855 Treaty Authority, which advocates for Ojibwe people’s off-reservation rights. “To me, Todd is the tip of the spear. He can see what his rights are. He doesn’t need to be told.”
Bibeau is not representing Thompson in the Asema case, though he filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the 1855 Treaty Authority. 
Claire Glenn, a former Hennepin County public defender who now works with the Climate Defense Project, is  Thompson’s attorney in the cannabis case. 
Glenn got to know Thompson when she represented him — and nearly 100 other “water protectors” —  who were involved in the Line 3 protests. More recently, she was his attorney in the ricing case that was dismissed this spring.
“He has a lot of integrity,” Glenn said of Thompson. “He lives his life in accordance with his values and without apologies. He has undertaken his own study of the treaties and the history of treaty making and Indigenous genocide. And he has learned a lot from the elders who came before him.”
An urban upbringing, mentoring by a spiritual tutor
Thompson grew up middle class, mainly in Minneapolis, where his father, Leonard, was a firefighter who pushed the Minneapolis Fire Department to loosen regulations limiting hair length for Native Americans.  
Thompson’s parents used to send him to the reservation during the summer, where the family still had property. At times, he stayed with a great-grandfather, Frank, who lived in a tar paper shack — not far from Thompson’s current home. 
For a city kid, the close-to-the land life of his kin took some getting used to. 
“He didn’t go to the store to buy meat. He shot deer, beaver, muskrat, whatever,” Thompson recalled. “For dinner, he would come out with a pan with some roasted animal — teeth and still head on — and you had to pick off your meat.” Accustomed to grocery store food, Thompson found it difficult to choke down the rustic fare. 
“But after three days of starving, man, you started eating,” he added with a laugh.
As a teen, Thompson drifted from early interests in boxing and hockey and started partying and chasing girls. He caused enough trouble that his parents didn’t hesitate when he expressed an interest in attending a Native American boarding school in Flandreau, South Dakota.
“A friend of mine, a Red Laker in Minneapolis, told me about the school. Made it sound all really cool and all that sh*t,” Thompson recounted. “And so I told my folks, ‘Hey, I’m thinking about heading out with Maynard and Tony and them guys.’ My dad was like, ‘That’s a great idea’ just to get rid of me because I was a hell raiser, only child.”
Although he only lasted one year at Flandreau, it made an impression on Thompson. He was exposed to some Native religious traditions for the first time and, he said, had mystical experiences. 
“That was the first sweat lodge I ever went to. And it was a  pretty powerful, profound f***ing experience,” he said. Other cultural practices also made an impression, especially the drums. “I didn’t know why, but when they would be playing the drum, my f***ing hair would stand up on the back of my neck and then just, I’d get that tingle.”
A year in boarding school was enough, Thompson said, so he returned to Minnesota and moved to St. Francis, in rural Anoka County, where his parents acquired a hobby farm. Thompson finished his last two years of high school in the exurbs but, he said, he struggled to fit in. “There were no Indian people there,” he said. “It was f***ing deadass country sh*t.”
As a young man, Thompson bounced around, got a DWI, and ultimately moved back to Minneapolis where he attended technical college and got a degree in graphic design. For a time, he worked at The Circle, a Native American newspaper in south Minneapolis.
He started a family and had four kids. At the same time, he found himself increasingly drawn to Native traditions. A seminal moment came when he attended a lecture at the American Indian Center by Eugene Begay, a revered spiritual leader and fluent Ojibwe speaker from Lac Courte Oreilles reservation in Wisconsin. 
“I listened to his talk and I’m like, man, there’s something going on here,” Thompson recalled. “And after his talk, I told him some things and he was like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you come on up and move in with me?’ He said, ‘I’ll show you a few things. I’ll teach you some things.’ I didn’t know what the hell he meant by that. But that sh*t kept beating away at me for about two weeks. And I just told the old lady, I said, ‘I’m going to go spend some time up there with that old man.’ I ended up living with him for two years.”
Begay had lost a leg, so Thompson took on a role as a helper and chauffeur, driving Begay to ceremonies and AA talks. 
Begay was not the only elder to influence Thompson. 
As a young man, he was arrested during the heyday of the treaty rights fight at Mille Lacs, a legal battle that ultimately culminated with a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the rights of Ojibwe people to hunt, fish and gather in territory that the Ojibwe ceded to the U.S. government in a treaty in 1837.
Thompson’s recollection of the episode revolves less around the legal nuances than the wild scene that unfolded at the boat landing. When the game wardens arrived at the scene to ticket the Native anglers for setting nets, Thompson said, he attempted to elude them by diving into the still icy waters. 
“I was the only one that ran in the water. I don’t know why, but I ran in f***ing water,” he said. “They arrested Vernon Bellecourt [the late American Indian Movement leader] and they arrested my dad. I’d swim 20, 25 feet, and pop up. I kept yelling:  ‘I’m practicing my 1837 treaty rights!’ Eventually, I got too cold. So then they grabbed me, pulled me in a boat, and I went to jail. The next day they’d let us go, give us our canoe back.”
Another influence, Thompson said, was his uncle, Marvin Manypenny, father of Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, and a well known White Earth land back activist. (Although they are cousins, Thompson said he is not close to Flanagan).
About 18 years ago, Thompson decided city life was not for him. He had a good job at the time, laying water lines, and a nice home in the St. Paul suburbs. He had been thinking about leaving for years before he finally broke the news to his then-partner and mother of his kids.
“I came home one day from work and I said, ‘I’m moving, babe. I hope you come with me.’ And she was like, ‘Let me think about it.’ And then she said, ‘No, I’m staying.’ I went and got a U-Haul truck loaded all my sh*t up, and I drove up north here and we worked out things with the kids and I found a house to rent.”
After saving for a spell, Thompson went to the White Earth land office and successfully applied for an allotment — an acre and a quarter near the community of Naytahwaush — where he now lives. 
When he opened his head shop Asema in 2019, Thompson said, no one in the vicinity was selling paraphernalia or bulk tobacco. These days, business is down and competition is up. Thompson said he hopes to stick it out.
 “Will I be able to keep going? Who knows? I’ll push it as long as I can,” he said. “But I love being my own boss. I will say that, man.”
Whether he can remain his own boss will likely hinge on the outcome of his court case.
Asked why he takes legal risks again and again, Thompson paused for a moment.
“I always tell myself I’m going to stop messing around with courts,” he said. “But, man, it’s in my DNA.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250429_152537-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-14 09:57:50.143580

On Monday Gov. Gavin Newsom decided the fate of the remaining bills lawmakers sent to his desk in September. 
Throughout this legislative session, a total of 917 bills awaited the governor’s verdict, according to longtime lobbyist Chris Micheli. Newsom signed 794 into law and vetoed 123 — citing “significant fiscal implications that are not included in the budget” for part of his reasons behind several of his vetoes. Stay tuned later this week for more on the bills Newsom spiked. 
As for the latest batches of measures he approved, Newsom greenlit two hotly contested pieces of legislation that drew strong pushback from bill opponents:

More housing near transit: Newsom is allowing denser housing projects located near major transit stations, reaffirming his alignment with the “Yes In My Backyard” movement. Opposed by local governments and neighborhood groups, the contentious bill went through 13 separate rounds of amendments that limited the measure’s reach to just eight highly urbanized counties and select transportation stops. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.


Caring for kids whose parents are deported: In response to the federal government’s crackdown on immigration, Newsom signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children’s caregivers if their parents are deported. The law widens who can sign a caregiver affidavit, which proponents say would help parents at risk of deportation to be able to choose a trusted person to care for their children if they are detained. But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights’ activists argued it would make it easier for strangers to sign the affidavit, which would endanger children. Read more from CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.

Other bills Newsom signed, including those on consumer protections and public health:

Insulin prices: On Monday the governor signed a bill capping insulin copays at $35 — a reversal of a bill he vetoed in 2023. More than 3.5 million Californians live with diabetes.


Expanding CARE Court: People experiencing psychotic symptoms due to bipolar disorder will be eligible for treatment under CARE Court, a mental health program intended to help seriously ill Californians living on the streets. Since its introduction in 2022, only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders have had access to the program. Read more from CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener and Marisa Kendall.


Pay for incarcerated firefighters: The hourly wage for incarcerated firefighters battling active wildfires will be raised from $1 to $7.25. The new policy is one out of five bills Newsom signed that seek to support incarcerated firefighters upon their reentry. Read more from CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.


Riding shotgun: Newsom signed a bill last week that originally proposed to ban smaller teenagers from sitting in the front seat, and require children as old as 13 to use a booster seat if they’re not tall enough. The measure has since been watered down and now requires children between the ages of 8 to 16, starting in 2027, to pass a five-step test to be considered properly restrained by a seat belt. Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow.


Protection against chatbots: California companies that operate online chatbots will be required to monitor chats for signs of suicidal thoughts, and to take steps to prevent users from harming themselves. Read more from CalMatters’ Colin Lecher.

The potential limits of ‘no tax on tips’

Restaurant servers, drivers for ride-hailing services, barbers and other tipped workers making less than $150,000 a year could deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their federal income taxes starting this tax year and through 2028.
But while President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge of “no tax on tips” may seem like a boon to these workers, some tax experts argue that the benefits may be limited.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, a Yale Budget Lab analysis found that a third of tipped workers do not make enough to owe income tax in the first place, and will not benefit from the provision. Experts also raised concerns that employers may cut workers’ pay because of the tax savings, and that consumers may stop tipping since they may assume all tipped workers will now be able to deduct their tips.
Most notably, however, is that the deductions may not be enough to offset the repercussions of the Republicans’ spending bill, said Kayla Kitson, a senior policy fellow at the California Budget & Policy Center.

Kitson: “It’s a bit of a distraction from the overall bill. … Many low-income tipped workers will likely be harmed by the cuts to health care and food assistance and the failure to extend enhanced premium tax credits.”

New data on CA’s anti-crime measure

Nearly a year after voters passed Proposition 36, a first-of-its-kind report reveals that few people are actually getting into the treatment promised by its proponents, writes CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich.
Released last week by the state’s Judicial Council, the report finds that about 9,000 people have been charged with a treatment-mandated felony within the first six months that the law took effect. Since then, 15%, or 1,290 people, elected treatment; 771 people were placed into treatment; and only 25 completed it.
The data also details how different counties are using the law: Orange County, for example, has the highest number of treatment-mandated felonies charged at 2,395, while Kings and Napa counties each had one.
Some supporters of the measure argue that district attorneys have difficulty implementing Prop. 36 because of a lack of state funding. Republican and Democratic state lawmakers requested as much as $600 million to implement Prop. 36, but Gov. Newsom and the Legislature ultimately approved a one-time allocation of $100 million in the state budget.

If Prop. 50 passes, Democrats hope to gain five more congressional seats in the upcoming midterm election. But the difference between the current maps and the ones proposed under Prop. 50 are similar in racial and geographic representation, according to a recent analysis by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.

Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley has garnered his most well-known  Democratic challenger yet in Dr. Richard Pan, the former state senator who once made national headlines for going toe-to-toe with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as California pushed to enforce school vaccine mandates.  


Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley’s newest Democratic challenger might be even more well known to Sacramento-area voters than the two-term congressman who has represented the area since 2023. 
Dr. Richard Pan, a Harvard-trained pediatrician and former state senator who made national headlines for leading California’s effort to eliminate religious and “personal belief” exemptions to school vaccine mandates, announced his candidacy for California’s 3rd Congressional District on Tuesday. 
Pan and Democrats nationwide hope to hold Republicans like Kiley accountable for supporting President Donald Trump’s megabill, which over the next 10 years will cause an estimated 10 million Americans to lose health coverage under Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
“We see a federal government that seems to be intentionally attacking health care, whether it’s taking away people’s health insurance, undermining public health to allow disease to spread, cutting research for things like cancer treatments,” Pan told CalMatters in an interview. 
“As a pediatrician, I’ve spent my life really trying to keep kids and their families healthy,” he added. “I’m running for Congress to be sure that we can protect people’s health care.”
Pan joins Democrats Tyler Vandenberg, a Marine Corps veteran and former “Jeopardy!” winner, and Heidi Hall, an environmental advocate and Nevada County supervisor, who launched campaigns against Kiley earlier this year.
Proposition 50 would remake the district
Kiley’s district is one of five that would shift to favor Democrats if California voters next month approve a plan to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts – known as Proposition 50.
While the district he represents currently spans much of the California-Nevada border and is in largely rural, forested areas, the new seat would encompass many of Sacramento’s eastern neighborhoods and suburbs, including Auburn, Rancho Cordova and Folsom. The new district would also include Grass Valley, Truckee and the California portion of Lake Tahoe, as well as the Eldorado National Forest.
Kiley, who has branded himself as a Republican foil to Gov. Gavin Newsom, has been a vocal opponent of Prop. 50 and accused the governor of targeting his seat because of his attempts to “Newsom-proof California” in Congress by eliminating the state’s ban on gas-powered cars and halting federal funding for high-speed rail.
“There’s a reason Newsom sent his own staffer to run against me last year,” Kiley wrote on social media last month, referring to Democrat Jessica Morse, “and has now made me the number one target of his redistricting sham.”
Pan, a Sacramento resident who supports Prop. 50, has previously represented about 70% of voters who live in what would become the new district, according to his campaign.
By challenging Kiley, whom Pan has characterized as a “rubber stamp” for House Republicans and Trump’s agenda, Pan hopes to also serve as a check on the Trump White House and a former nemesis of his own, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
Pan started pushing to eliminate religious and personal belief exemptions to school vaccine requirements after public health experts traced the origin of a 2014 measles outbreak to an unvaccinated Disneyland traveler. His 2015 bill, and a subsequent measure in 2019 to strengthen that original law, ignited Kennedy’s anti-vaccine activist allies and prompted harassment from opponents, death threats and physical violence against the then-state senator. 
“I even had blood thrown at me and got assaulted on the street, but I didn’t back down,” Pan said of the bills he led that ended religious and personal belief exemptions for school vaccination requirements. He said Americans “should be very disturbed and concerned and worried” about Kennedy’s leadership. 
The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Pan said he first ran for the state Assembly in 2010 to address the gridlock he saw in California’s government. He said he watched as local hospitals struggled to make payroll because state lawmakers couldn’t agree on a budget. Now, seeing the same thing in Washington, D.C., he said he wants to make the government “work for people” again – which he says Kiley failed to accomplish despite at times paying lip service to bipartisanship and pushing to outlaw mid-decade redistricting nationwide. 
“Talk is easy,” Pan said. “When push comes to shove and you get to that bill where you basically get to choose between, ‘Do I support the president’s agenda, or do I defend the people in my district?’ he chose to support the president’s agenda.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/112224-Richard-Pan-RC-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

Emotional fights erupted over a controversial attempt this year to counter antisemitism in schools by restricting what teachers teach in classrooms, exposing a political quagmire for California Democrats who needed to balance the needs of Jewish communities against the fury of a growing pro-Palestinian base.


Tears welling in her eyes, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan paused mid-sentence to calm herself on the Assembly floor.
Almost a century ago, the Nazis forced her grandmother to flee Austria, leaving behind her great-great-grandmother who died in the Holocaust, the Jewish Democrat from San Ramon told her fellow lawmakers. Last year, she said, her daughter told her that the bathrooms at her school had been vandalized with swastikas. 
“My children deserve to show up at school and not have to face hate crimes in their building, to face the symbols that represented the end of their relatives,” she said.
Stories like hers, as well as Hamas’ attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, prompted California’s Jewish lawmakers to make countering antisemitism in schools their top priority this year. They sought to create a list of words and ideas that could not be mentioned in classrooms, including heavily disputed claims about Israel. The effort sparked the biggest, most emotional legislative fight of the year: Should the government regulate what can be taught in schools? If so, how far should it go?
At issue was Assembly Bill 715, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law this month after it went through multiple major, sometimes last-minute rewrites during months of political tussling. 
Champions have argued the law will protect Jewish students from rising bullying and discrimination, sometimes from teachers. While the state does not collect data on antisemitism in schools, reports of anti-Jewish bias statewide have doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to the California Department of Justice. Last year, more than 15% of all hate crime events in California were anti-Jewish, even though Jewish people make up about 3% of the state population.
“We cannot hide from the profoundly unfortunate truth that Jewish kids are being isolated, made to feel unwelcome, and verbally and physically attacked. And far too often, our schools are failing to protect them,” Assemblymember Rick Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat and co-author of the bill, said during a May hearing, when the bill started as merely a promise to curb antisemitism in schools.

By July, it had undergone a major overhaul, including determining that any instruction that “directly or indirectly deny Israel’s right to exist,” equating Israelis with Nazis, or disrespecting “the historical, cultural, or religious significance of Israel to the Jewish people” would count as creating an “antisemitic learning environment.” It reinvigorated debates over whether criticism of Israel’s founding, or even the belief that Jewish people should have an independent country in their ancient homeland, counts as antisemitic — something Jewish thinkers do not agree on.Mainstream Jewish groups maintain that anti-Zionism, a broad term that generally opposes the idea of a standalone state with a Jewish-majority population, is antisemitic. Many Jewish academics, however, don’t think it is antisemitic on its own, but they agree that blaming individual Jews for the actions taken by the Israeli government is antisemitic.
That July version of the bill drew heavy opposition from a vast coalition of education groups, from teachers unions to school boards, civil rights advocates and Muslim community organizations, who feared censorship of pro-Palestinian voices and infringement upon academic freedom. They would remain opposed through its many iterations, and many of them urged Newsom to veto it.
Their concerns lingered even as the bill was ultimately watered down in the final days of this year’s legislative session to address bias more broadly: The final version no longer mentions the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and bars using professional development materials that violate the state’s anti-discrimination laws. It also requires “factually accurate” instruction that is free of “advocacy, personal opinion, bias, or partisanship” — a controversial element the bill’s authors said they ran out of time to tackle and promised to “clean up” next year.
“In its current form, this bill only reinforces broader national trends of silencing constitutionally protected speech, erasing historically relevant curriculum, and persecuting anyone who expresses even the slightest opposition to the federal administration,” said Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a freshman Democratic lawmaker from Rancho Cucamonga and former teacher and school board member, who ultimately abstained from voting on the measure.The squabble over the bill was messy, marked by hundreds of attendees, hourslong hearings, and accusations of bad faith from both sides. Bauer-Kahan called a teachers union advocate who opposed the bill antisemitic. After the bill passed out of the Legislature, a handful of pro-Palestinian activists protested from the Assembly gallery for more than an hour, yelling: “You will all have blood on your hands!”

The tension highlights the discomfort for California Democrats, who, despite having traditionally defended Israel, have had to reckon with a base growing increasingly critical of Israel. They faced a tough choice: Support the bill and risk upsetting some of the most powerful labor allies as well as their pro-Palestinian constituents, or oppose the bill and risk being labeled as antisemitic or unwilling to combat antisemitism. Amid the pressure, some Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill even as they warned it could be used to censor free speech. Others abstained instead of taking a side.
“I’m actually surprised that California state legislators would want to even touch it, because it’s just so radioactive right now,” said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at Sacramento State University. “It just feels like at this political moment, we want to lower the temperature, not shine a spotlight on ways in which we might target each other.”
The issue was such a hot potato that many lawmakers avoided tackling it early in the legislative process, when policy differences are often ironed out, said Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, a freshman progressive Democrat from Pasadena who chairs the Senate Education Committee. When the bill arrived in her committee in June, it still had no substantive language. Some lawmakers told her to not touch it either, while others left it up to her to “take care of it,” she said.
“The ball got thrown to me,” she told CalMatters. “And people knew that they were doing that.”
‘People would end up being very angry on both sides’
California’s Jewish lawmakers introduced the bill in response to intensifying clashes in schools and college campuses nationwide over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza. For some Democrats, the timing couldn’t have been worse.
The Gaza war has forced a tidal shift within the Democratic base, as voters’ support for Israel’s military campaign tanked over the past two years. That has forced some Democrats, even moderates who have historically backed Israel, to condemn the country and pull away from pro-Israel donors. Young Democrats are also more critical of Israel than their older peers, so any vote that could be perceived as silencing pro-Palestinian voices is risky.
“A very strong part of Democratic and leftist values that we are seeing expressed now is anti-genocide or anti-war,” Nalder said. “(For) my students who are politically active, this is one of the chief issues that they care about.”
The bill also came as President Donald Trump ordered immigration agents to arrest student activists critical of the Israeli government and withheld billions of dollars in funding from universities for their alleged failure to protect Jewish students. At least half a dozen other state Legislatures sought to fight antisemitism in schools this year, with some adopting a highly disputed definition of antisemitism in state education codes. Enraged, some opponents accused California Democrats of taking a page out of Trump’s playbook.

But the Democratic lawmakers had to balance all that with the risk of upsetting the Jewish community, a key voting block. A no vote could be construed as antisemitic, making the lawmaker vulnerable to challenges in the next election, Nalder said. 
The bill was the sole priority of the 18-member California Legislative Jewish Caucus, which is composed entirely of Democrats and led by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel of Encino and Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, who chair the budget committees in their respective chambers.
Neither would speak with CalMatters about what happened with the bill. Gabriel’s office did not respond to several CalMatters emails seeking an interview, whereas Wiener declined to comment, pointing CalMatters to the bill authors instead. 
David Bocarsly, executive director of the Jewish Public Affairs Committee, which sponsored the bill, said the caucus’ backing was crucial.
“The Jewish caucus was able to leverage their influence and respect with their colleagues and effectively represent the Jewish community’s needs,” he said. 
Pérez acknowledged the political challenge, telling CalMatters she would have preferred to hold the bill until next year, but said legislative leaders had promised to deliver a bill the governor could sign this year. She said some colleagues told her it was “an impossible situation” to navigate.
“They felt like there was no winning,” she said. “Regardless of what they would try to do to make amendments to it … people would end up being very angry on both sides.”
A debate over academic freedom
The clash over AB 715 is the latest episode of yearslong strife over how to teach about marginalized communities in California’s K-12 schools and who should be included. 
In past years, the fight primarily focused on ethnic studies — a mandatory high school course on the history and culture of groups such as Latinos, Asian Americans, African Americans and Native Americans. The state adopted a model curriculum in 2021, after years of fine-tuning amid disputes over which ethnic minority groups to teach about and criticism from Jewish advocates, who accused past versions of being antisemitic. 
Jewish lawmakers championed a bill earlier this year that aimed to tackle antisemitism by restricting the ethnic studies curriculum, but the effort was stopped early in its tracks, and legislators turned to AB 715 instead. 
“This is a bill about protecting Jewish students, and it shouldn’t have been controversial,” said Bocarsly, of JPAC. “If we don’t teach empathy and understand it, we’re going to build a generation of intolerance, and that’s what we’re trying to correct for.”
He said AB 715 was “the hardest political fight in JPAC’s history” and that the initial definition of an antisemitic learning environment was only meant to offer teachers guidance. 
But opponents had two major concerns: that the bill’s initial definition of antisemitic learning environment risked silencing discord about Israel, and that even in its final watered-down version it could chill free speech and open teachers up to lawsuits for teaching about anything controversial.
“Jews are most safe when democracy flourishes, when pluralism flourishes, not when rights are taken away,” said David Goldberg, president of the California Teachers Association and a Jewish father to three children who attend public schools.

What’s safe for Jews was itself a matter of disagreement among the bill’s backers and dissenters. Bocarsly said CTA leadership’s opposition to every version of the bill shows that they “have little interest in supporting a bill that would protect Jewish students.”Goldberg, in an interview, called that accusation “a lot of chutzpah, frankly.”
The fact the bill even tried to prescribe what an antisemitic environment looked like in classrooms was concerning to Kenneth Stern, a scholar on hate. More than 20 years ago, he was the lead author of the highly controversial definition of antisemitism that’s been adopted by some states this year. It all but labels anti-Zionism as a form of antisemitism. Now, nearly 50 countries, including the U.S., have embraced the definition. 
Though Stern wrote the definition, he opposes using it to restrict speech in schools, arguing that it could threaten academic freedom and fuel censorship by chilling discussion about controversial topics. Stern said despite all the revisions made during the process, the final version will likely make antisemitism worse. 
The law creates an antisemitism prevention coordinator to advise education and legislative leaders and says the person in that role should use federal guidelines published under former President Joe Biden as “a basis” for decision-making. The controversial definition of antisemitism Stern wrote is labeled as the most prominent definition of antisemitism in those guidelines, though it mentions others. 
“I understand why people care about (preventing antisemitism in schools),” he said. “They want the Legislature to do something. I think the legislators are sincere that they want to do something. This is the wrong thing.”
Educators like Goldberg worry the bill could allow bad-faith critics to also dispute a wide array of controversial topics taught in schools. Will it become the basis for critics of the transgender community to pressure teachers to say there are only two genders, he wondered.Gabriel Kahn, a Jewish teacher in Oakland who said he’s being investigated by his school district after challenging the content of an antisemitic training last year, said he fears prosecution for voicing the need to distinguish between antisemitism and criticism of Israel.
“What I’m most afraid of is that in the Democratic state of California, we can pass a censorship bill that protects a foreign nation from criticism implicitly,” he said. “What does that say about the future of academic freedom in our country?”

But small children face new seat belt rules under a law Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last week.","In summary
After pushback from some Democrats, a controversial bill that would have banned short kids from the front seat was watered down. But small children face new seat belt rules under a law Gov. Gavin Newsom signed last week.


A new California law aims to keep more short children in booster seats for longer, imposing fines if they can’t properly wear their seat belt.
Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a watered-down version of Assembly Bill 435 that originally proposed to ban smaller teenagers from sitting in the front seat and to require short-statured youth to use booster seats into their middle school years.
But enough of the Democrats who control the Legislature balked at ending the time-honored tradition of teens calling “shotgun” to ride in the front seat. 
Instead, they settled on changing the standards police officers use to determine if a child is tall enough to safely wear a seatbelt while riding in a vehicle. Currently, California law requires children to use booster seats until they turn 8 or reach a height of 4 foot 9 inches.
That won’t change under the law Newsom signed. But beginning in 2027, children from 8 to 16 years old will have to pass a five-step test to be considered properly restrained by a seat belt under California law. 
If the driver of a vehicle can’t answer “yes” to all of these five questions about their seat-belted child passenger, the driver could get a ticket and fines of $490.
1. Does the child sit all the way back against the seat?
2. Do the child’s knees bend comfortably at the edge of the seat?
3. Does the belt cross the shoulder between the neck and arm, resting on the collarbone?
4. Is the lap belt as low as possible, touching the thighs?
5. Can the child stay seated like this for the whole trip?
The bill’s proponents said the point is to encourage children and their parents to stay in booster seats until they’ve grown tall enough for a seat belt to fit them properly. The new rules are in line with recommendations public health officials and the California Highway Patrol have for years encouraged parents to follow.
Advocates cite numerous studies showing that small children in car wrecks are more likely to be severely injured or killed because seat belts aren’t designed for their small frames. It’s also especially dangerous for small-framed children to sit up front. 
“The longer the child can be using a booster if they do not meet the test, the better, because it is so important to have the belt in the right place,” said Stephanie Tombrello, the former executive director SafetyBeltSafe U.S.A. and a longtime proponent of seat belt laws. 
Original bill was a tough sell
The original version of the bill would have banned teens up to 16 years old from sitting in the front seat if they couldn’t pass the five-step test.
The bill also would have required all children younger than 10 to use booster seats and bar all those under 13 from sitting in the front seat. The measure also would have required children as old as 13 to use a booster seat unless they passed the five-step test.
But even with child and automotive safety and health care groups supporting the bill, it proved to be too tough a sell in its original form for its author, Democratic Assemblymember Lori Wilson of Suisun City. 
Her bill sailed through its first two committees. Then, in May, the bill died when Wilson brought it to the Assembly floor. It needed 41 votes to pass. It got 35, with 25 Democrats not voting, which counts the same as voting “no.”
As CalMatters reported, Democrats almost never vote “no” on their colleagues’ bills. Instead, they typically don’t vote at all. In the Capitol, it’s seen as a more polite way of saying “no” and less likely to lead to retaliation. Not voting also allows politicians to dodge accountability for controversial votes since it’s difficult for a member of the public to determine if a particular lawmaker was actually there to vote that day. 
Wilson told CalMatters that part of the resistance from her Democratic colleagues was fallout over controversial legislation that sought to increase penalties for teen sex solicitation. That legislation raised difficult questions in the Democratic caucus about how hard to crack down on those accused of soliciting sex from minors, based on whether the victims were younger or older teenagers.
Then along came Wilson’s bill soon after. Wilson said conservative media outlets made comparisons between the bills, since hers sought to have the state treat some teens like small children. That was seen as hypocritical given the resistance from progressive Democrats to increasing penalties for those soliciting sex from older teenagers.
“It then started getting eyes on it,” she said. “And people started talking about, ‘Well, actually, I have a 10-year-old, and they don’t want to sit in a booster seat. I don’t want them to sit in a booster seat.’”

None of the Democrats who didn’t vote on the bill in May spoke during the bill’s brief Assembly floor hearing.

Spokespeople for Cottie Petrie-Norris of Irvine, Maggy Krell of Sacramento, Rhodesia Ransom of Stockton, Jesse Gabriel of Encino and Christopher Ward of San Diego did not make them available for interviews.
The following month, Wilson brought the bill back to the Assembly. Noting that many of her colleagues were leery of the bill, she promised to fix it in the Senate.
With her assurances, the bill squeaked by with 42 votes. Then, after the most controversial provisions were removed, it passed the Senate unanimously. 
Wilson said she’s satisfied with the version of the bill that Newsom signed and has no plans to resurrect the more controversial measures in future legislation.

Pedro Hernández is a historian and California program manager for GreenLatinos.


Yosemite National Park turns 135 this year. For many Californians it may feel distant by miles, but near at heart. 
Its rivers irrigate our farms, its forests clean our air and its wildlife capture our minds and hearts. For Latinos — even those who have never visited — Yosemite flows through our lives: in the water we drink, the food we grow and the landscapes we cherish. We are in Yosemite’s history.
Yet this anniversary should give us all pause, because today Yosemite and the lands that hold so much rich history are under threat. 
An icon of that history, George Meléndez Wright, fought for the park long ago. Hired in 1927, Wright was the first Latino naturalist in the National Park Service. 
He saw how mismanagement was threatening park wildlife. When Congress refused to fund a survey of the wildlife there, Wright funded it himself. His “Fauna No. 1” report became the park service’s first science-based wildlife plan, an authoritative text that guided its wildlife management for more than 30 years. 
By age 27, Wright had reshaped the park service’s mission for generations to come. Two mountains were later named after him.
Wright’s story is more than a footnote. His values — humility before ecosystems, scientific integrity, respect for life — remain vital to Yosemite’s future. They matter more now as climate change, habitat loss and mismanagement intensify. 
Today Yosemite faces a danger Wright never could have imagined: the erasure of its human stories and the dismissal of park staff.
A park under pressure
In March, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14253, which he called “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.” It directs federal agencies, including the Interior Department, to purge “improper ideology” from parks, museums and monuments.
Translation: Narratives that confront slavery, Indigenous dispossession, colonial expansion or racial injustice could be treated as improper. Latino histories, migrant perspectives and environmental justice struggles — inherently complex and contested — may be erased.
The Interior Department already has issued Secretarial Order 3431 to implement the mandate. With vague terms like “divisive narrative” and “shared American values,” officials now have broad discretion to soften or delete inconvenient truths. 
In Yosemite, museum exhibits and interpretive signs are under review. The park’s official story risks being sanitized into scenery alone, stripped of labor, conflict and resistance.
These ideological pressures come as the park service faces severe staffing and budget cuts. 
In early 2025, about 1,000 employees — nearly a quarter of its workforce — were laid off. In Yosemite, biologists and watershed scientists have been reassigned to clean bathrooms or staff entry gates.
A coalition of 40 former national park superintendents warned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that parks are opening without enough staff to maintain safety, protect habitats or prevent vandalism. Garbage is piling up, trails are decaying and wildlife goes unmonitored. 
With fewer staff to steward, research, interpret and educate, all visitors bear a risk.
Latinos already face barriers to accessing parks — cost, language, transportation. Executive Order 14314, dubbed “Making America Beautiful Again by Improving Our National Parks,” will add to that by increasing park entrance fees for “nonresidents,” which will impact many Latinos in California. 
Environmental groups such as the national GreenLatinos urge California’s congressional delegation to demand transparency before park narratives are altered. Elected leaders also should fight agency cuts and firings and defend Wright’s vision of science-based stewardship, which cannot survive without trained staff and adequate funding. 
Americans should reject any policy that “restores truth” by erasing complexity. If executive authority can decide which histories and people are permissible, then our collective national memory and national parks become hostages to politics. 
Yosemite’s future anniversaries will matter only if both land and story are protected. Let’s insist the next 135 years be written by many hands, many voices, all truths.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/070723-Yosemite-National-Park-MG-CM-15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)“Buy now, pay later” consumer loans in Nevada may soon be easier to get, and they may come with better consumer protections, thanks to a new state law that went into effect earlier this month.
BNPL loans are typically interest-free and paid back in four or fewer installments. They can be seen as the modern-day equivalent to layaway, except that the customer receives the product they’re purchasing upfront rather than after the payments have been made.
They are not always seen by customers as loans, but BNPL are short-term loans that have become increasingly popular with online shoppers. Sometimes called “pay in 4,” these payment plans are now widely available — at luxury brand stores and dental offices, to retail giants like Walmart, and even delivery app leader DoorDash.
Passed by lawmakers and signed by the governor earlier this year, Senate Bill 437,removed from state law a requirement that internet-based consumer lenders, like those offering BNPL loans, maintain a physical office in the state. The new law went into effect Oct. 1.
The change was first pitched in 2021 through legislation sponsored by  then-state Sen. Ben Kieckhefer. A representative for Affirm, a publicly traded company that offers BNPL loans, testified to lawmakers that year that it maintained a physical office in Nevada in order to comply with state law but “has never had a single customer come to the location.”
Other buy now, pay later companies appear to have opted simply to not operate in Nevada.
This year, Kieckhefer, now a lobbyist for Affirm and another fintech company, Upstart, resurrected the effort.
Consumer protections
Peter Aldous, a consumer rights attorney at Legal Aid of Southern Nevada who supported SB437, believes the most substantial part of the new law are provisions requiring the lenders to use Nevada law to govern the loan.
This should end the use of “choice of law” clauses, which says a different state’s laws govern the contract. Typically that chosen state is one like Utah or New Jersey with more lax consumer protections.
“For the most part, we have strong consumer protection laws,” says Aldous of Nevada.
Consumers likely won’t notice the change buried in their BNPL fine print, but it could make a big difference if they found themselves in a dispute.
Critics of BNPL warn that these types of short-term financing generally offer less protections for consumers than credit cards, particularly when it comes to refunds after returning products.
In May 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued an interpretative rule clarifying that BNPL lenders are credit card providers and customers have the right to dispute charges and demand refunds.
The rule followed earlier research by the CFPB found that 13.7% of BNPL loans in 2021 involved a return or dispute.
“Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,” said then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra when announcing the rule.
Chopra was fired by President Donald Trump in February of this year. In May, the Trump administration announced it would not enforce the earlier Biden-era rule and is contemplating rescinding it.
Also changing at the national level this year: BNPL loans may now impact your credit score. FICO this year announced it would begin incorporating BNPL data into its credit score model.
Industry growth
Buy now, pay later loans have been around for several years and gaining traction with consumers.
PayPal’s chief executive has said BNPL is an area of growth for the company and is driven by younger consumers who are wary of credit cards. Another giant of the industry, Klarna, held an initial public offering last month.
The Consumer Protection Finance Bureau in January released a report on BNPL and found that 21% of consumers with a credit record financed at least one purchase in 2022 using one of the six BNPL firms: Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle and Zip. They also found that the majority of these consumers are taking out multiple BNPL loans at a time. Approximately a fifth of BNPL users can be classified as “heavy users” who finance more than one purchase per month with BNPL.
According to the CPFB, people with the lowest credit scores make up nearly half of all BNPL loans, though their default rate on BNPL loans is lower than their default rate on their credit cards — 2% compared to 10%.
Many BNPL lenders require customers to set up automatic direct deposit payments from their checking account, making repayment more likely.
Aldous from Legal Aid says a BNPL loan might be the best option for a consumer who would otherwise use a credit card or high interest payday lender. But there are concerns about deceptive marketing that can lead people to taking on too much debt.
While many associate BNPL loans with interest free loans over a few months, these companies also offer loans with longer terms and interest. Sometimes interest and fees can also be tacked onto the interest-fee loan if a customer misses a payment.
“That’s where you can get caught up, getting too used to paying over time, and not lining up your budget,” says Aldous. “People don’t think of it as a credit card. They think, ‘I’m going to have a monthly bill. I can afford that.’”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234677734-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

(Photo by Dragos Condrea/iStock Getty Images)As the government shutdown extends to almost two weeks, state agencies aren’t expecting any immediate impacts to federally funded nutrition programs this month. However, as more days go by, food access advocates worry about whether an overhaul to food programs already scheduled to start in November will result in scarcer resources for those in need. 
The state had already secured October’s funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, according to the Utah Department of Workforce Services. The Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, is also afloat for the month, and the state is still processing applications for both.
“We are issuing SNAP benefits as normal in October, but we have not yet been informed by USDA if funds will be provided for November, so we are awaiting further federal guidance,” a Utah Department of Workforce Services spokesperson said in a statement.

What happens in November is still uncertain without an agreement between Republicans and Democrats to fund the federal government. The pause in some government operations also brings questions about new requirements for nutrition programs mandated by the spending package widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.”
Starting Nov. 1, the government is expanding its work requirements for different assistance programs, including SNAP for people between 18 and 65 years old.
Nutrition program for women, infants and children to stay afloat through end of month

“States have not received a lot of guidance on that,” Gina Cornia, director at Utahns Against Hunger said on Monday. “And so we’re concerned about the impact that implementing those work requirements starting Nov. 1 will have because the Department of Workforce Services, if they need technical assistance and if they need policy guidance, there isn’t anyone right now at the USDA that is providing that.”
With the uncertainty, some advocacy groups, including Utahns Against Hunger, are planning on making a request to Gov. Spencer Cox this week to ask for a delay on implementing the changes in light of the government shutdown. 
“Right now states can’t afford to implement new provisions without more guidance from the USDA,” Cornia said.
About 169,300 people in Utah received SNAP benefits during the 2024 fiscal year. If they don’t have those funds to feed their families, Cornia worries they’ll have to go without, or use other resources, which could overwhelm food pantries and food banks across the state.



Let us know what you think...


 


“If they suddenly have to accommodate tens of thousands of more people, it’s just not going to happen,” Cornia said of the food banks. “They can’t fill that gap.”
Pantries are already seeing more people than ever before, Cornia said, and more so with reduced federal support for programs like the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for seniors. Adding more pressure could have “devastating” ripple effects.
Other shutdown effects
Funding has been shifted to approved expenses during the latest days of the shutdown — troops will get paid come Oct. 15 after the Pentagon “identified approximately $8 billion of unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds” from last fiscal year. 
And WIC will remain afloat through the rest of the month with a $300 million transfer from its child nutrition programs account, which has long been funded in part by tariff revenue.
At Salt Lake City’s airport, operations by the Transportation Security Administration are running smoothly, said Nancy Volmer, director of communications and marketing at the airport. 
“We’re keeping a close eye on it, and just if there are any sort of impacts, we’ll make sure that we get the word out to the passengers,” Volmer said. “But we’re just asking that passengers plan plenty of time in case there are any delays. And then also just to be kind to the workers up front, because this is a really difficult time for them.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A state bar association last week sharply criticized the U.S. Department of Justice for bringing felony charges against an attorney in a lawsuit challenging Alabama’s gender-affirming care ban.
In an indictment unsealed last month, the department charged attorney Carl Charles with allegedly lying to a panel of three judges who were investigating allegations of judge-shopping in the case.
In a statement released last week, the New York State Bar Association said that the rules of conduct that govern the profession dictate that the tribunal of judges and the respective bar associations are the ones that should address allegations of professional misconduct and not the U.S. Department of Justice.

“The City Bar urges the Executive Branch to adhere to the rule of law, cease warping the Department of Justice’s missions and functions by targeting individuals and groups the administration politically disfavors, and refrain from attempting to criminalize attorneys who advocate on behalf of transgender people and other marginalized communities,” the statement said.
The Bar also said that the panel did not include several facts pertaining to the incident when the judges had concluded its investigation and presented the findings to the judge overseeing the case who eventually sanctioned Charles.
Charles was charged with making a false statement to a grand jury or court, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. The case is still pending.
A message was sent to the New York Bar Association on Monday seeking additional comment.
According to his biography found on the Lamba Legal website, Charles worked with the New York City Commission on Human Rights Law Enforcement Bureau, investigating and prosecuting violations of New York City Human Rights Law.
The lawsuit sought to overturn a 2022 law allowing prosecutors to charge physicians with a felony when they prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapies for transgender youth.
U.S. District Judge Liles C. Burke in May of that year issued a temporary injunction against the prescription ban, ruling it interfered with parents’ rights to decide the welfare of their children. A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit of Appeals overturned the ruling in 2023, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in  Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated federal abortion protections in part by saying the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not protect rights “not deeply rooted in the nation’s history and traditions.”
Charles and other attorneys representing the families were accused of trying to manipulate the system by allegedly attempting to secure a judge more sympathetic to their clients’ position by dropping an initial filing and then refiling the lawsuit.
A panel of three judges was convened to investigate the incident and called Charles and the other attorneys to testify about their roles in the incident. Burke sanctioned Charles, along with Melody Eagan and Jeffrey Doss, after the panel issued the findings. He ordered that Eagan and Doss be removed from the case and imposed a $5,000 fine for Charles. Burke also publicly reprimanded the three attorneys and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office who then charged Charles with making a false statement to the panel investigating the incident.
The charge pertains to a statement that Charles made before the panel denying that he made a phone call to the chambers of U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson to ask questions about the case and the temporary restraining order that was filed.
The New York State Bar Association said that the findings from the three-judge panel did not include that Charles eventually admitted to making the phone call to the judge’s chambers and later apologized.
“Further, the indictment mentions neither that Mr. Charles had no advance notice that the related case designation and phone call would be subjects of the inquiry nor that he indicated that he was very nervous and was trying to be as forthright as possible,” the statement from the New York Bar Association said. “Additionally, at no point during the inquiry did the court, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, or the three-judge panel find the call to be improper in which case Mr. Charles’s initial statement about the call was immaterial.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240717_083407-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

Baxley, the youngest attorney general in the country when he was elected to the office in 1970, reopened the case. In 1977, he successfully prosecuted Robert Chambliss for his role in the bombing. Chambliss was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1985.

“I felt strongly about the Civil Rights Movement from the beginning. I’d always thought it was wrong to mistreat you because of the color of your skin,” Baxley said. “This time with the death of four children in the house of worship, I thought that exceeded all the bad deeds.”
Jones reopened the case for the remaining two suspects when he was appointed U.S. District Attorney in Northern Alabama in 1997. He prosecuted and won convictions against Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. in 2001 and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002. Cherry died in Kilby Correctional Facility in 2004. Blanton died in Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2020. 
“It’s a journey about this community and this state, and really for Bill and myself. This was a remarkable case, and cases, for lawyers to get involved in,” Jones said.
The tour started in Germany in March. Lisa Borden, deputy federal policy director for SPLC, said in an interview after the event that the German government has done a good job of sharing an accurate history of the Holocaust. However, she said, pushback has started from far-right groups.
“For the last 10 years, at least, there has been a real trend in our country for far right rhetoric to become mainstream in politics in the US. Even back when we were together in Germany in March, we didn’t understand how relevant this was going to be by the time we sit here today,” Borden said. “Since the beginning of the year, there has been an assault on history in our country.”
Borden said that it is important to remember the history of the Civil Rights Movement and the Holocaust so that it does not repeat itself. 
“When the Nazis were planning their final solution, they looked at U.S. laws. They looked at Jim Crow and the eugenics that had been practiced during slavery and during the Reconstruction Era and even during the Jim Crow period,” Borden said. “These are the instruments of hate that have been used since time immemorial.”
Throughout Jones’ cases, he kept coming back to a photo of Denise McNair, one of the four girls killed in the bombing, holding a white Chatty Cathy doll. He said it reminded him then, and now, of hope.
“At the time, it was hope of a race here in America. But today, it’s really a hope for everyone, given all that we’re doing,” Jones said. “Even when I tried these cases years ago, immigration issues and other issues of hate will begin to bubble up. And today it’s really the hope of so many people that we can all live on this planet together, love each other a little bit more, (and) respect each other a hell of a lot more.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ba42e469-4ed6-4409-9e27-304b767f5da4-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-14 08:57:13.231073

Late on October 9, Israel’s cabinet formally approved plans for a ceasefire with Hamas, setting a Gaza peace process in motion. U.S. President Donald Trump announced that it constituted the “first phase” of his twenty-point peace plan that the White House had unveiled last week. Qatar, a critical player in the mediation efforts, has confirmed the developments, as have Israeli and Hamas officials.
Once both sides proceeded with a pause of the conflict, Hamas moved forward with the release of all of its living hostages.  Israel, in turn, has begun releasing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump, addressing Israel’s Knesset after the hostage release, declared that the war had “ended,” though other White House officials and experts have noted the fragility of the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that the deal “opens the door to an historic expansion of peace in our region,” while Hamas leader Ghazi Hamad said that the group would “determine its responses” for commitment to the ceasefire after the hostage-prisoner stage was complete.
More than twenty countries’ officials gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday to discuss paving the way for peace in Gaza, though neither Israel nor Hamas had a representative at the table.
The movement toward a truce comes after days of intense negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Egypt and European and Arab partners in Paris. It falls on the heels of the war’s two-year anniversary, which broke out on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel from Gaza. Around 1,200 people were killed by Hamas fighters and another 251 were taken hostage. Israel responded with a major military offensive that has killed more than sixty-seven thousand Palestinians, according to data from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.
The warring sides have twice tried and failed to uphold a ceasefire, once in November 2023 and again in March 2025. Both efforts collapsed and experts warn that hurdles remain, but broad international support for the latest effort has led to greater optimism.
The new plan lays out “tough conditions for Hamas and Israel,” CFR Middle East expert Steven Cook wrote. Several points have long been contentious issues between the two. “Whether this leads to an end to the war remains an open question.”
Here’s what the twenty-point peace plan entails.
 What have Israel and Hamas agreed to so far?

A ceasefire. Israel and Hamas agreed to halt fighting. This initial ceasefire went into effect on Friday after Israel’s cabinet formally approved the agreement the day before. Trump’s peace plan sketches this out as “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen.”
Israel’s military action in Gaza had reportedly intensified until right up to the ceasefire deadline. Since the truce, Palestinians have been returning in droves to Gaza City after an Israeli military spokesperson declared it safe to head back to the enclave’s previously most populous city.
A military drawdown. The Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), agreed to withdraw their troops up to a line that leaves it in control of 53 percent of the enclave. The White House released a map of the Gaza Strip that shows this would be the first of three stages of Israel’s withdrawal.



Israel Completes First Phase of Gaza Withdrawal
The plan states that two further withdrawal phases will follow





(Map: Austin Steinhart for CFR based on map released by the White House.)





The White House plan indicates future withdrawals to around 40 percent and 15 percent of Gaza territory. The final stage keeps a security perimeter until Gaza is “secure” from any “resurgent terror threat.” On October 10, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed in a social media post that Israeli troops had finished the first phase of the withdrawal.



A hostage and prisoner release. The twenty hostages who are still living and were among those taken in October 2023 were released back to Israel on Monday morning. Hamas has not yet released the bodies of the twenty-eight deceased hostages that remain in their possession. Hamas said it would give back four of the hostages’ bodies on Monday, but the timeline for their return remains unclear. Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas, 147 were released or exchanged in prior deals. Eight of those released were dead, and the bodies of 41 others were previously recovered by Israel.
As part of the exchange, Israel has begun the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners who are serving life sentences in Israel, as well as 1,700 detainees from Gaza. The first buses of Palestinian prisoners arrived in the West Bank and Gaza on Monday. Israel will also give back fifteen Palestinian bodies for the remains of each Israeli hostage it receives. Several high-profile political figures at the top of Hamas’s release list were not included in the deal.
Aid delivery increases. The White House’s plan says that “full aid” will be sent to Gaza “without interference,” which Trump has specified means six hundred trucks carrying aid per day. This includes “rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.”
Aid groups have warned that the enclave has faced a growing humanitarian crisis as the conflict has continued. The World Health Organization has said that Gaza hospitals are at a “breaking point”—94 percent are damaged or completely destroyed and supplies are falling short. The UN-backed global hunger monitor, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system, has said there is an “entirely man-made” famine in Gaza and emphasized the need for the resurgence of aid.
Israel has maintained that Hamas has undermined aid efforts and has forcefully denied the famine determination, which it says is based on Hamas data and a manipulated process.
The United Nations reported on Sunday that progress on aid was “well underway” in the strip. Supplies such as cooking oil flowed in for the first time in months, the UN humanitarian office reported. UN officials said that the aid is still falling short of what is needed to address a widespread humanitarian crisis.
Troop deployment. The Rafah crossing with Egypt has been opened for aid delivery, European officials have confirmed, while a small Israeli troop presence remains there. The United States is also sending two hundred troops to Israel to monitor the ceasefire and help with aid delivery. No U.S. troops will be deployed directly inside Gaza, officials say.
 What happens next? 

Trump joined officials from more than two dozen countries at a Gaza peace conference to work out more details in Egypt on Monday. Netanyahu didn’t attend because of a Jewish holiday, his office said.
Long term, Trump’s twenty-point plan stipulates that no Palestinians will be militarily forced to leave Gaza, and that Israel will agree not to occupy or annex the Gaza Strip. The enclave will “be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough,” the plan reads. At the same time, Gaza must be “a deradicalized terror-free zone” that “does not pose a threat to its neighbors.”
In the more immediate future, the twenty-point plan encompasses a range of different efforts.
Stabilization. The United States and Arab and other international partners will join forces to form an International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza for security as it undergoes the transition from war to peaceful governance. The ISF will also train and support vetted Palestinian police forces. The plan aims for the IDF to progressively hand over the occupied Gazan territory to the ISF as the Israeli military withdraws its forces.
Governance. At the same time, Gaza will transition to “temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” which will operate under an international board headed by Trump. The only other member of the board who has been publicly announced so far is former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who will have a central, but still undefined, role. The “Board of Peace,” as Trump calls it, aims to set the framework and monitor funding for Gaza’s redevelopment. The Palestinian Authority (PA), the governing body of the West Bank, will simultaneously undergo a reform program to prepare for governance of the strip.
Demilitarization. An independent monitor group will oversee the “demilitarization” of Gaza, including placing weapons “permanently beyond use” and an internationally funded “buy-back” program. All “military, terror, and offensive infrastructure” will be destroyed, a condition that Hamas has previously refused and is expected to resist.
Economic reform. A panel of experts will convene and come out with an economic development plan to “rebuild and energize Gaza.” They also hope to establish a special economic zone with preferred tariff and access rates (to be negotiated with participating countries). The peace plan didn’t address the amounts or sources for funding for reconstruction of the battered enclave head-on, but the World Bank estimated earlier this year that it would cost more than $50 billion. The plan cites “thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas” to “create jobs, opportunity, and hope” for Gaza, without elaborating on what those are.
Negotiations over the next sets of details will continue as observers watch to see whether the first phase holds.
Over the longer term, the PA will eventually take over governing the Gaza Strip after it has been reformed, the White House plan says. It claims that “regional partners” will “guarantee” that Hamas and its factions will comply with the details of the plan and won’t pose a threat to the region, though it does not provide further details of how this will work. There will also be an “interfaith dialogue process” to “try and change the mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,” who have long been at odds, on the “benefits of peace.”
The final point in the peace plan is for the United States to “establish a dialogue” between Israel and the Palestinian territories to agree on a political horizon “for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”
“The first stage of this peace plan is the easy part,” CFR Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies Elliott Abrams told CFR. “As world attention turns away when the fighting stops, these intractable issues will be no less difficult to solve than they have in the past decades.”
 What is the outlook for peace in Gaza?

Hamas will not have a future role in governing, according to the plan, but its members will be offered amnesty if they agree to peaceful coexistence or are provided safe passage out of the area. The group, which has governed Gaza since 2007, has steadfastly opposed the proposals of laying down weapons for good or giving up power. Israel, meanwhile, has long demanded these terms. Hamas has previously said it would not disarm until Palestinian statehood is recognized. “Success depends in the long run on Hamas giving up its struggle to destroy Israel through what it calls ‘armed resistance’ and the United States calls terrorism,” Abrams said.
Importantly, the plan does not guarantee the establishment of a Palestinian state, a longtime goal of the PA and the PLO, or Palestine Liberation Organization. It does acknowledge the possibility, saying that only after reform to the PA and Gaza reconstruction will there be “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.”
Israel has agreed to the plan in full, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted having the PA play a role in governing Gaza. Several of the hardline members in his cabinet are also likely to oppose some of the provisions in the later phases, experts believe, with some already condemning them.
“There is no appetite for a two-state solution among Israelis who have concluded after October 7 that Palestinians do not want to live side-by-side in peace with them,” Cook said. Indeed, the latest local polling shows that a growing majority of Israeli Jewish and Arab respondents oppose a two-state solution. At the same time, a majority of Israelis—66 percent, up thirteen points from last year—believe it is time for the war to end.

The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.
As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Donald Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company’s responsibility to build functioning systems, “rather than to prioritize their bottom line.”
Democratic senators Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.
“They’re essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don’t get health care,” Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.
“They’ve got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,” Wyden said. “Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.”
Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.
As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.
A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.
Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.
States are in a “major sprint” to make changes by 2027, she said, and they’re being “inundated” with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.
“I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,” Serafi said.
Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states’ costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.
The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.
“Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems’ failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual’s eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,” the senators wrote.
The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies’ contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company’s lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.
By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.
The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.
Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they’ve been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.
Georgia has not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion, which has granted benefits to millions of adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they’re working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state’s Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.
The Georgia program has cost $109 million, with $34 million spent on health benefits and more than $20 million allocated to marketing contracts, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state reports. Deloitte built Georgia’s eligibility system and is the primary consultant for the Pathways program.
Before Medicaid work requirements became federal law, Arizona also submitted a request to federal regulators to launch its own version that would apply to roughly 190,000 people.
The state’s application provided insight into the types of system changes states may soon need to make to manage the new federal work requirement.
Arizona Medicaid officials said they would gather information on enrollees’ work hours, training, and education. The state’s eligibility system, which is operated by Accenture, would also need to check whether someone is exempt.
States are in the early stages of determining changes they need to make to implement work requirements.
Tessa Outhyse, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the state expects upgrades to be processed “through the existing contractual change order process.” State contracts with eligibility companies often set aside millions to cover the cost of changes, but systems may require upgrades beyond the agreed-upon work.
In Missouri, upgrades are expected to cost roughly $33 million, according to a state budget document.
The state has a contract with private company RedMane to handle some of its Medicaid eligibility processing. Missouri plans to hire an additional contractor to ensure it properly institutes Medicaid work requirements, according to Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for Missouri’s Department of Social Services.
Medicaid eligibility contractors “have a lot of leverage and expertise to influence contracts, to win contracts,” Wyden said. “They can do a lot more, to the value of what we’re giving them.”

After months of speculation, Maine Gov. Janet Mills officially announced on Tuesday she’s running for U.S. Senate in 2026 to try to oust long-time Republican Sen. Susan Collins. 
Mills, a former state attorney general and district attorney, gained a national profile when she told President Donald Trump in February “see you in court” after he tried to deny federal funding to Maine over the state law that allows transgender athletes to compete on girls’ sports teams. 
Known locally as a moderate Democrat, Mills terms out as governor next year and has reportedly been scouted by national Democrats to launch a bid against Collins. But the Democratic primary field has been taking shape with political novices banking on frustration with establishment figures, including Mills and Collins. 
“I think I can win this, and I think I’m the one who can beat Susan Collins, because I have a track record of winning and of delivering for Maine people,” Mills said in an interview with the Bangor Daily News ahead of the official launch.
Mills v. Collins
So far, Mills has shied away from critiquing Collins, while other candidates have been vocal critics. 
Last month, when a reporter asked Mills whether she believed Collins was adequately pushing back on Trump’s actions, she said, “She’s in a tough position. I appreciate everything she is doing.”
Mills’ comment prompted the following quip from another challenger, oysterman and military veteran Graham Platner: “I do not appreciate everything that Susan Collins is doing.” 
Platner’s critiques of Collins started immediately when he made a splashy campaign launch in August. In his launch video, he equated Collins to “the oligarchy.” 
He’s also said Democrats need to stop running establishment candidates chosen by the party elites in D.C., pointing to earlier failed attempts to unseat Collins using that very tactic. Collins’ victory over Democrat Sara Gideon in 2020 came after pollsters had Gideon ahead by six points. 
This time around, many of Collins’ challengers are focusing on their working-class roots, living the same affordability challenges as their would-be constituents, and trying to draw a contrast to Collins, a now-multi-millionaire who is approaching 30 years in Congress.
Eyeing a sixth term, Collins is facing pressure from both sides

With the possibility of Mills entering the race being floated for months, several other candidates have already said whether that would influence their decision to remain in the running. 
Platner and Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide who spent a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C., have said they won’t drop out, while Dan Kleban, cofounder of Maine Beer Company, refrained from a clear answer. 
History of standing up to Trump
Mills’ “see you in court” remark that pulled her into the national spotlight this year was not the first time she’s stood up to Trump or his allies. 
When Trump visited Maine in 2020, he criticized her response to the COVID-19 pandemic and called her “a dictator” who “doesn’t know what she’s doing.” Mills, who is the first female governor of Maine, responded, “I have spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weakness.” 
When Mills earlier served as Maine’s attorney general, she also routinely clashed with the Republican governor at the time, Paul LePage, a long-time political ally of Trump. 
For example, Mills sued pharmaceutical companies for their role in the opioid epidemic and then used settlement funds to purchase overdose-reversal kits — after LePage had vetoed legislation that sought to provide police greater access to opioid overdose medication. In 2017, LePage supported Trump’s ban on immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries, but as the state’s chief legal officer, Mills challenged it in court. LePage then unsuccessfully sued Mills. 
Background
Mills, who grew up in Farmington, first entered public service as an assistant attorney general and, in 1978, she co-founded the Maine Women’s Lobby to advocate for abused women after seeing faults in how the criminal justice system handles such cases. She then went on to become district attorney for Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford counties and later serve in the Maine House of Representatives. 
After serving as attorney general from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2013 to 2019, Mills was elected governor in 2019. 
Some notable accomplishments during her tenure include expanding access to MaineCare, Maine’s Medicaid program, ensuring abortion access following the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade and meeting the obligation to pay 55% of the cost of K-12 education for the first time in the state’s history. She also ushered the state through the COVID-19 pandemic and launched free community college, though the future of that program is now uncertain. 
She’s taken flack from both sides of the aisle for some of her funding plans, with Republicans objecting to any tax increases and Democrats pushing back on program cuts. But she’s walked the line, rejecting any broad-based income tax changes while making significant investments in health and child care. 
The state has seen record savings under Mills’ tenure.

(Photo by Scott Housely/CDC)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]In public settings, the leading candidates for governor in New Jersey say they support the state’s current childhood vaccine requirements and believe the state should pursue herd immunity.
But the two differ on the details, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill saying she would follow “vaccine protocol” and Republican Jack Ciattarelli promising to allow more parents to opt out of vaccine requirements for their children.
The two are campaigning to replace a term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in January as state health officials express alarm about declining immunization rates and a dip in herd immunity, a threshold level of community immune protection sufficient to restrict the spread of disease.
Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman, has promised that if she becomes governor, she would work with other northeastern states that have joined forces to develop their own science-based vaccine guidelines in the wake of federal policy shifts driven by vaccine skepticism in the Trump administration.
When asked during the first gubernatorial debate at Rider University about falling immunization rates nationwide and the rise in infectious diseases like measles, Sherrill said New Jersey parents “should be very worried.”
“These are eminently curable diseases and we are allowing children to get sick and, yes, die because we are not appropriately following medical research and vaccine protocol,” she said.

New Jersey, as the nation’s most densely populated state, is particularly at risk, Sherrill said, since close contact increases the chance of transmission. Nationwide, more than 1,500 measles cases have been diagnosed this year alone — including 10 in New Jersey — and three children have died, two in Texas and one in New Mexico, according to federal data. 
“These are diseases that in my childhood had been pretty much eradicated,” Sherrill told WPIX-TV recently. 
Ciattarelli has also pledged to uphold New Jersey’s current childhood vaccine requirements, or schedule, and said his priority as governor would be to protect public health and safety.
“The rise in things like measles, mumps, and whooping cough and the like is very, very concerning,” Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, said at Rider University. “We’ve got to get above the threshold for herd immunity to keep our communities safe.”
But Ciattarelli has also publicly said he would never mandate a vaccine, and last month joined an event hosted by the New Jersey Public Health Innovation Political Action Committee, which opposes mandatory vaccination, where the keynote speaker was a doctor who claimed COVID-19 vaccines can make people magnetic, according to the New York Times.
“Jack will oppose a one-size-fits-all vaccination schedule, support medical and religious exemptions for vaccines, and create a parental rights ombudsman in state government to give parents more of a voice on key issues, including those seeking a philosophical vaccine exemption,” Ciattarelli’s website says. 
Early in-person voting in the gubernatorial race begins October 25. Election Day is November 4. Mail-in ballots are being accepted now.
The front-runners’ campaigns have focused largely on affordability, with Ciattarelli seeking to connect Sherrill to unpopular elements of Murphy’s tenure and Sherrill underscoring Ciattarelli’s support for — and endorsement from — President Trump. But Ciattarelli, who almost defeated Murphy four years ago in a race shaped largely by voters’ feelings about the Murphy administration’s response to the pandemic, has also emphasized parental choice around education, gender identity, and health care. 
Sherrill has said Ciattarelli’s connection to vaccine-skeptics shows he is “taking his cues from fringe activist, conspiracy theorists” whose “extreme policies” will reduce access to vaccines and lead more children to become sick from preventable diseases. 
“People are getting sick because of politicians like Jack who campaign with anti-vaxxers and spread dangerous lies about our public health, and it’s clear we can’t trust him to keep our kids safe and healthy,” she said in a statement.
Ciattarelli told reporters at Kean University recently that parental choice and herd immunity are not in opposition. Communities would still be sufficiently protected even if families have more ways to opt out of childhood immunizations, he said, since the majority currently comply with the state immunization requirements. 
“Considering how many parents still vaccinate their children according to the current recommended schedule, I don’t think herd immunity is an issue here,” Ciattarelli said.

Guidelines for the use of vaccines are shaped by various federal bodies, but states control their own immunization schedules, a mix of recommendations and requirements that dictate what shots are given to newborns and what is needed to attend public school or child care. New Jersey requires children attending K-12 schools to get seven vaccinations — including the MMR, which targets measles, mumps, and rubella, and influenza — some involving multiple doses over several years. COVID-19 shots are not mandated for school. 
Immunization levels have declined in New Jersey and other states in recent years as concerns about the COVID-19 vaccines have elevated the voices of longstanding vaccine skeptics, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump tapped to lead federal health programs. 
Herd immunity varies depending on the disease, but Dr. Kaitlan Baston, a former commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health, warned state lawmakers in April that all counties in the Garden State had dipped below the needed threshold — 95% — to block measles transmission. The rate has also declined nationwide, federal data shows, so that 93% of kindergarteners were immunized against measles last school year, leaving some 286,000 youngsters unvaccinated. 
Baston said state officials need to work with medical providers and local health leaders to make sure families have accurate information about the risks and benefits of vaccination. Immunizations have saved 150 million lives globally over the past five decades, according to the World Health Organization. COVID-19 vaccines saved between 14 and 20 million people worldwide in the first year they were available, a study by the National Institutes of Health found. 
New Jersey health officials have continued to encourage people to get vaccinated, with recent campaigns highlighting the risk of seasonal respiratory illness and reminding people that measles is a preventable disease. The health department has also ordered pharmacists to offer COVID-19 vaccines to anyone older than 6 months — the minimum age for which they’ve been approved — regardless of federal guidance. State insurance officials are calling on insurance companies to cover the cost. 
Dr. Eddy Bresnitz, a vaccine expert and former state epidemiologist, said herd immunity or community protection is “not a single entity,” but varies depending on the disease. Measles is highly infectious, increasing the need for more people to be vaccinated in order to protect those who have health risks that prevent them from getting certain shots. Public health measures like keeping children home from school when sick, wearing masks, and regular hand washing also impact how a disease spreads, he said. 
Vaccine requirements “are not just about protecting children in the school setting. It’s also about protecting adults,” including teachers and administrators who are not able to be immunized themselves, Bresnitz said. The same principle applies in the wider community, he said. 
All states permit children who have immune disorders or cannot be vaccinated for other medical reasons to be exempted from these requirements. Like most states, New Jersey also allows for religious exemptions, a category that has become more popular in recent years. In 2019-2020, 3% of pupils opted out of immunizations for religious reasons; by last year, religious exemptions had risen to 5%, state data shows.
While most parents still support vaccination, Bresnitz — who lives in Pennsylvania — said adding another option for exemptions, as Ciattarelli proposes, inevitably increases the pool of unprotected children.
“The easier you make it for parents and caregivers to exempt their children” from the vaccine schedule, “the more likely it will put the community at risk,” he said. 
Ciattarelli has said that parent advocates want a process that provides them more information before they consent to shots for their children, along with options to “spread out” the vaccine schedule. The number of shots babies must get is “of great concern to a great number of parents across the state,” he said.
“The schedule is very different today than when my kids were children, and when I was a kid,” he said. 
Vaccine skeptics emerged as a political force here in late 2019, when Democratic leaders in the Legislature sought to limit New Jersey’s religious exemption, claiming it was being misused. Thousands of people, including many families with children, converged on Trenton for one of the largest, loudest Statehouse protests in recent times. Even Kennedy, founder of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, made an appearance. Democrats abandoned the reform effort, which has not resurfaced since.

Family treatment courts save money and improve efficiencies. The societal benefit is clear: Children and families are safer and better off.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Meghan Masterson: We cannot afford to lose the Family Treatment Court docket.","This commentary is by Meghan Masterson of Burlington. Masterson is the executive director of KidSafe Collaborative, which serves as a member of the Chittenden County Family Treatment Court Docket steering committee.


Last month, it was announced that the Chittenden County Family Treatment Court docket will close at the end of the year. For those of us who have worked closely with this initiative, the news is heartbreaking and deeply disappointing.
The family treatment court docket, which is based on a nationally recognized evidence-based model, was created to support families affected by substance use disorder through a collaborative, trauma-informed and family-centered approach. It focuses on particularly challenging cases, where the stakes are highest for adults, children and the systems that support them.
This approach has been shown to work and be more effective than traditional dependency court processes. For adults, family treatment courts have been found to get people into treatment faster, retain people in treatment longer and support completion of treatment. For children, having parents participate in a family treatment court makes it substantially more likely they will achieve reunification without increased risk of future foster care reentry. 
Family treatment courts save money and improve efficiencies. The societal benefit is clear: Children and families are safer and better off.
The Chittenden County docket has been a powerful example of what is possible when courts, child protection, treatment providers and community organizations come together around a shared vision. It created real opportunities for parents to pursue recovery and for children to experience safe, stable connections. It stands as proof that when systems align and people persist through the inevitable challenges of collaboration, outcomes for families improve.
The closure of this docket is a step backward. At a time when Vermont families continue to grapple with the increasingly complex challenges of substance use and our communities cry out for effective solutions, we should be digging in to safeguard programs that work, not dismantling them because of funding decisions. 
The children and parents who would have benefited from this model next year will no longer have that opportunity. The professionals who staffed this program and relied on the docket as a structure for collaborative work will lose an evidenced-based and effective strategy. Our most stretched and overburdened systems will be forced to return to inefficient and less effective models of support.
The lessons of the family treatment court docket are too important to lose. Vermont must find a way to sustain and replicate this model, because the well-being of children and families demands it, and because our community deserves it.

Spokespeople for both the Flint Bishop International Airport and Grand Rapids’ Gerald R. Ford International Airport confirmed Monday afternoon that they have not been playing the video. Meanwhile, Matt Morawski, the director of communications and external affairs for the Wayne County Airport Authority, which operates the Detroit Metro Airport, directed the Michigan Advance to a spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration, noting that the monitors are located in a TSA-leased space in the airport. 
However, the spokesperson, Amanda Osborn, was unable to provide further information on whether the video was being shown, on account of the government shut down. 
An automatic reply from Osborn’s email reads “I will be out of the office starting Wednesday, October 1, 2025, due to the current federal funding hiatus. I will not be able to return emails or telephone calls until I return to duty upon conclusion of the funding hiatus.”
Kasey Posa, director of marketing and public relations for Flint Bishop International airport told the Advance in an email that the airport’s operations have not been impacted by the federal government shutdown with flights running on schedule and no staffing or service interruptions. 
“We continue to stay in close communication with our federal partners to monitor the situation and remain prepared should circumstances change,” Posa said. 
Heidi Groenboom, communications and events associate for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority said that as of Monday afternoon, they had not received the video and that it was not playing at the airport.
In the video, Noem said “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government” acknowledging the shutdown has affected operations, with many TSA employees working without pay.

“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” Noem said. 
According to a report from Reuters, more than 23,000 flights were delayed last week due to the government shutdown, while some 13,000 air traffic controllers and roughly 50,000 TSA officers are working without pay. 
Since the shutdown began, the Trump administration has received repeated criticism as several federal agencies display messages laying the blame for the government shutdown at Democrats’ feet. According to a report from Politico, the Small Business Administration shared a template for automated response out-of-office emails for furloughed employees which reads in part “I am out of office for the foreseeable future because Senate Democrats voted to block a clean federal funding bill.” 
Democrats have noted that Republicans control both the U.S. House and Senate, as well as the White House, and as the party in control have the ability to pass legislation that would reopen the government.
The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen has filed legal challenges against nine government agencies over the messaging, alleging a violation of the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, in a federal facility or using federal property.

But paying more won’t mean getting more. 
In Missouri, insurance doesn’t guarantee access. It often guarantees delays, denials and avoidable harm. Behind those higher costs are insurer rules that reach beyond billing and into clinical decisions once left to physicians.
Insurers argue these rules control costs in a system where waste is a legitimate concern. But in practice, they’ve become barriers that delay treatment, increase administrative spending and force patients through unnecessary tests. 
In a 2024 AMA survey, 94% of physicians said insurance pre-approvals, often called prior authorizations, delay treatment and 29% said it led to serious adverse events such as hospitalization or permanent disability.
Linda Quach, a former ICU nurse in Missouri, saw firsthand how insurer rules endangered patients.
“One incident that still haunts me today was when my patient needed an urgent MRI, but his insurance wouldn’t approve it unless we did a CT scan first,” she told me in a recent interview. “Our physicians said the CT wouldn’t be helpful, but we had no choice. The stress of transport caused his vitals to crash, and by the time we got back upstairs we had to code him. It was my first code, and it left me traumatized.”
Many hospitals already run overbooked CT and MRI machines, with inpatient and outpatient imaging sharing the same limited equipment and staff. Outpatients often wait weeks between scheduling and receiving a scan, and urgent inpatient cases can displace their test at the last minute.
When insurers require unnecessary procedures, they don’t just delay care for one patient. They limit access for others already waiting. 
In stroke care, timing is critical. Clot-busting drugs like tPA and TNK must be given within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and only after imaging confirms the stroke is not caused by bleeding. When machines are tied up by avoidable imaging, it can delay diagnosis for patients whose outcomes depend on speed. Insurer rules that require sequential tests are intended to control costs, but they can worsen system-wide delays when they override medical judgment.
For many Missourians, those rules extend far beyond imaging. When insurers update or restrict their drug formularies, patients can lose coverage for medications that were already working. A 2024 Missouri Foundation for Health survey found that one in three Missourians skipped or rationed prescriptions because of cost, and more than half delayed or went without other care. 
Doctors are often required to follow “step therapy” policies — sometimes called fail-first rules — forcing patients to try cheaper alternatives before an insurer will approve the drug their physician originally prescribed. 
Unsafe staffing is the quiet emergency in Missouri hospitals

Prior authorization can also limit which doctors or specialists patients can see, or which treatments are covered, depending on the plan’s network and review process. In practice, medical decisions often hinge less on a clinician’s judgment and more on what the insurer is willing to cover that month.
Nationally, private insurers deny nearly one in five in-network claims. Investigations show some denials are issued with little or no physician review. Insurers defend these policies as safeguards against unnecessary care, yet investigations continue to show that these barriers delay or deny medically necessary treatment across the health system. 
In Missouri, as in most states, many people with private insurance are covered by self-funded employer plans regulated under federal rather than state law. A federal statute called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, exempts these plans from most state oversight. 
ERISA’s preemption clause was originally designed to enable national uniformity in employer-based benefits, rather than shield insurers from accountability, and today it constrains states’ ability to act when those plans deny care. In the Supreme Court’s 2004 Aetna v. Davila decision, which ruled that patients harmed by coverage denials under ERISA-regulated employer plans can’t seek damages under state law,limiting accountability for insurer decisions.
That regulatory gap became painfully clear when Anthem ended its contract with University of Missouri Health Care on April 1, 2025, putting about 90,000 Missourians out of network. For more than three months, many insured Missourians faced canceled appointments, limited access to their regular providers, or out-of-network costs they could not afford, without knowing when or if coverage would return. A new agreement was reached in July and applied retroactively, but the disruption showed how vulnerable patients are when insurers control access without accountability. 
For thousands of Missourians, insurance itself became a barrier to care, forcing many to choose between paying out of pocket or delaying treatment.
The MU-Anthem dispute exposed what happens when insurers operate with little state oversight. In legislative hearings that followed, Director Angela Nelson of the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance testified that her agency has “no real authority” over many commercial insurance products — leaving Missourians with little recourse when coverage fails and regulators unable to act even when patterns of delay or denial emerge.
The Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance conducts market conduct examinations and reviews rate filings, many of which are made public through SERFF. But unlike some states, Missouri does not routinely publish detailed market conduct examination reports beyond settlement summaries. 
Consumers can see proposed rates, but they rarely have access to the specific findings from these examinations or to the corrective actions regulators require of insurers, when regulators identified violations or required corrective action.
Missourians are expected to shoulder rising costs without meaningful public accountability.
As reimbursement stagnates and insurers retain more of each premium dollar, hospitals absorb growing losses through uncompensated care — the combined cost of charity care and unpaid bills. In 2023, Missouri hospitals absorbed more than $1 billion in uncompensated care, according to the Missouri Hospital Association.
The Affordable Care Act’s Medical Loss Ratio rule requires insurers to refund excess premiums when they spend too little on patient care and quality improvement. Those rebates make the flow of money visible, showing how insurer margins can expand even as hospitals operate at a loss. Missouri has no framework to tie those rebates to patient access or workforce stability, particularly for ERISA-exempt employer plans that fall outside state oversight.
The cost of inaction is clear to Quach, the ICU nurse: “Unsafe staffing ratios. Administrators who prioritize budget over lives. The emotional whiplash of being both essential and expendable.”
Premiums are rising even as many Missourians already can’t afford healthcare. Insurers are rebating millions while hospitals absorb tens or hundreds of millions in unpaid and unreimbursed care. Rural hospitals are closing, safety-net facilities are shrinking, and patients are left with nowhere to go. Insurer accountability should be as visible as hospital transparency. 
The state can’t keep calling that efficiency.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-10-14 07:58:47.140335

(Photo courtesy of the Indiana State Teachers Association)New data shows that while Indiana teacher pay has climbed in recent years, Hoosier educators still earn less than peers in neighboring states — a gap union leaders and some legislators say threatens teacher retention and classroom success.
Members of the Interim Study Committee on Fiscal Policy spent much of their final meeting on Friday examining teacher and administrator salaries, student-to-teacher ratios, and other education funding trends. 
The statewide median teacher salary was $60,100 as of the 2025 fiscal year, compared with $98,193 for school administrators and $114,825 for corporation administrators, according to a presentation prepared by the Legislative Services Agency.
The mean salary across Indiana was $63,424 for teachers; $99,556 for school administrators; and $116,731 for corporation administrators.
Though average salaries rose about 4% from 2024 to 2025, LSA staff told the committee that when adjusted for inflation, median wages for teachers and administrators have actually declined since 2020.
Suburban districts continue to pay the most, while teachers in rural and small-town schools saw the smallest wage growth, according to the LSA analysis.
Public schools spent roughly $824 million on teacher and administrator benefits in 2024, nearly 80% of it for health insurance.
‘We simply have to raise teacher pay’
Joel Hand, representing both the American Federation of Teachers Indiana and the Indiana School Social Workers Association, told the committee that Indiana “still lags far behind our other Midwestern states.”
He pointed to Wisconsin, for example, where teacher salaries averaged $65,196 for the 2023-24 school year. Ohio, meanwhile, reported average teacher pay at $72,644.

“If we want to keep those students who are getting degrees in education from leaving to go to Illinois or Ohio or Wisconsin or Michigan, we simply have to raise teacher pay,” Hand said.
He emphasized that Indiana currently ranks 39th in the nation for average teacher salary, citing data from the National Education Association. 
“If we want to address teacher retention … we have to raise teacher pay across the board,” Hand told lawmakers.
Gail Zeheralis, with the Indiana State Teachers Association, echoed those concerns. She reminded the committee that the 2019 Governor’s Teacher Compensation Commission had set a goal of a $60,000 average teacher salary.
“A $40,000 salary in 2019 equates to roughly $50,000 today, and a $60,000 average in 2019 equates to about $76,000 in today’s dollars,” she said. “Indiana must continue increasing state funding.”
LSA staff told lawmakers that statewide, student-to-teacher ratios have declined — from 17.6-to-1 in 2019 to 15.6-to-1 in 2025 — while the student-to-administrator ratio dropped from 208-to-1 to 196.9-to-1 over the same period. 
The trend, said LSA Assistant Director Austin Spears, mirrors national patterns but is “really driven by an increase in the count of teachers” rather than student enrollment growth. 
Still, Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, noted the roughly 1,300 open, unfilled teaching positions currently posted on the Indiana Department of Education’s website.
But other committee members questioned whether funding decisions at the local level steer too few dollars directly to classrooms. 
“It’s frustrating up here … that we want to take care of teachers as best we can, because we think that helps us educate kids better,” said Sen. Scott Baldwin, R-Noblesville. “But dollars going into the school system from this body don’t seem to always make it into the classroom or teachers’ pockets.”
Hand responded that “the erosion of collective bargaining for teachers at the local level” has weakened educators’ ability to advocate for fair pay and working conditions.
Story continues below.

Hand additionally called attention to Indiana’s severe shortage of school social workers, which he and others flagged as a “critical” issue in the midst of growing mental health needs across the state’s schools.
The latest data from the state and national school social worker associations showed that Indiana has a student-to-social worker ratio of 1,829 to 1 — massively above the recommended ratio of 250 to 1.
“With the enormous crisis we have in Indiana — and really throughout the country — with mental health in our schools, this is a ratio that I would strongly challenge you as members of the General Assembly to work on,” Hand said.
School social workers are different from school counselors and are primarily focused on students’ lives outside of the classroom and on helping deal with issues outside of school that interfere with academic progress. 
Hand said that despite holding master’s degrees and being specially-certified, school social workers are typically not considered to be teachers and many are not on teacher contracts. 
He urged legislators to include social workers in the state’s definition of “teacher” for funding purposes, arguing that change will make it easier for school social workers to get hired or be qualified for raises.
Possible legislative solutions
Lawmakers and education advocates pointed to Senate Enrolled Act 146 — approved earlier this year — as a starting point for potential reform, but said additional changes are needed to make teacher pay competitive.
That law raised the minimum teacher salary from $40,000 to $45,000 beginning June 30, and increased the share of state tuition support that school districts must spend on teacher compensation from 62% to 65%.
Indiana’s annual average teacher pay tops $60K — but many still make less — per new report

It also created a statewide Teacher Recruitment Program to help fund training and placement in high-need schools, while requiring annual reports on expanding affordable health plan options for educators.
Several lawmakers on the committee signaled interest in going further. 
Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, suggested offering weighted funding or incentive pay for shortage areas such as special education and STEM fields — “a market-based approach,” he said, that would help schools recruit for the hardest-to-fill roles.
Baldwin continued to push for greater transparency in local spending to ensure that “dollars reach classrooms and teachers,” rather than being absorbed by administrative growth.
Qaddoura additionally proposed a deeper analysis of district administrative structures to distinguish between small charter schools and large corporations when comparing salary ratios, noting that such distinctions “would give us a clearer picture of where our dollars are actually going.”
Other ideas discussed included restoring stronger collective bargaining rights for teachers and giving districts more flexibility to redirect certain capital project funds — like those used for athletic facilities — toward salaries. 
“We just need to somehow loosen up that money for teachers over another astro-turf football field,” said Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle.
No formal recommendations were adopted, but lawmakers said the findings will guide education discussions in the 2026 legislative session. 
“We’ve seen the data,” Thompson said. “Now we need to figure out what levers we can pull.”

I sit at a folding table with my neighbors, check in voters, and keep watch as democracy unfolds right before me.
There is nothing more uplifting and inspiring than to see neighbors from every walk of life voting.
Voters come as they are. Working parents bring their young children along, modeling the importance of being an active participant in our community and our democracy. 
Young voters exercise the franchise for the first time, sometimes with nervous excitement, sometimes with friends cheering them on. 
New Americans walk in with pride on their faces. 
Seniors who have voted in every election since Lyndon Johnson are there. 
In the voting booth, we aren’t defined by our age, race, income, or political affiliation — we’re Minnesotans coming together across differences to make our voices heard. 
But, as November approaches again, our democracy faces threats.  
Billionaires, big corporations and the politicians they fund who want to take us backward are sowing doubt by trying to convince people like you and me that our elections and our neighbors who run them can’t be trusted. 
They are also rigging the rules of our democracy so that they can maintain their wealth and power by distracting and dividing us.
That makes it even more important for us to vote and have our voices heard every chance we get. Because no matter what we look like, how we pray, or how much money we have in our bank accounts, we all deserve the freedom to vote and choose our leaders. 
Our democracy is a group project, and we can’t afford for Minnesotans to sit on the sidelines this election season or any to come. Voting equals power, and it is among the few tools at our disposal to fight the influence of the wealthy and big corporations and the politicians they fund.
Voting in Minnesota is safe, easy and secure. We lead the country in voter turnout, and it’s no wonder: Minnesota also has some of the strongest voter protections in the country, including guaranteed time off from work to vote and same-day voter registration. Our elections are run by professional election officials and supported by our friends and neighbors — from a mix of major political parties, as the law requires — who have stepped up to serve as election judges.
Whether you vote in person on Election Day, vote early at your city hall, or are one of the nearly 1.3 million voters across Minnesota (nearly 40% of voters) who cast their ballots by mail in 2024, you can be sure your vote will be counted accurately.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic lawmakers are proposing a package of higher education bills to help address affordability for students by investing in a statewide tuition promise program and to support faculty and staff members by reversing Walker-era collective bargaining and tenure policies. 
Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire), the ranking member on the Assembly Colleges and Universities committee, said Democratic lawmakers are looking for ways to ensure Wisconsin’s higher education system is strong and accessible to “anybody who has the talent and the work ethic to want to pursue something.” 
“That’s part of our American dream, is that no matter where you start out in life, you’ve got an opportunity to do better and to gain knowledge and training,” Emerson said. 
Emerson said Democratic lawmakers hope the bills can kickstart discussions about policy changes that could be made. She noted that Republican lawmakers have often stripped proposals from the budget, saying that policy should be passed through individual bills outside of the budget process.
“We’re putting some of these bills back out now and saying, let’s have the policy discussion,” Emerson said. “If you’re not willing to have that during the budget, let’s have the discussion now.” 
Emerson said the first pair of bills that lawmakers unveiled at a press conference last week seek to specifically help with the affordability of higher education. 
“A lot of us heard loud and clear last election that pocketbook issues are really what are leading people right now,” Emerson said, adding that it’s part of the reason she supported the recent state budget. “But it wasn’t a perfect budget, and so we thought, how can we make this a little bit better?”
One bill, coauthored by Sen. Kristin Dassler-Alfheim (D-Appleton) and Rep. Brienne Brown (D-Whitewater), would implement a statewide “tuition promise” program, allowing first-time, in-state students from households with an adjusted gross income of $71,000 or less to have their tuition covered at any UW school, other than UW-Madison. Under the bill, the state would dedicate nearly $40 million towards the program. 
The program would function as “last-dollar, gap funding” meaning it would fill in the rest of the tuition costs after all federal and state grants and scholarships are calculated.
According to The Hechinger Report , as of 2024, 37 states offered a statewide promise program. 
UW-Madison already offers “Bucky’s Tuition Promise,” which launched in 2018 and is funded with private gifts and other institutional resources, not state tax dollars. The program guarantees four years of tuition and segregated fees for any incoming freshman from Wisconsin whose family’s annual household adjusted gross income is $65,000 or less. 
Recent studies have found the tuition promise program increased enrollment among accepted students at UW-Madison and increased retention rates. 
UW-Milwaukee also offers its own program which covers up to four years of tuition and segregated fees for students from families earning less than $62,000 per year. 
The UW system also has a version of the program that recently relaunched in 2025 after the system secured private funding. The Wisconsin Tuition Promise first launched in 2023, but was ended in 2024 after Republican lawmakers declined to fund the program. 
Another bill by Dassler-Alfheim and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) would invest $10 million in the UW system for student retention and talent development efforts. 
At the press conference last week, Dassler-Alfheim said the bills are essential for supporting the state’s workforce.  
“If our workforce is the engine that runs our economy, then our Universities of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical Colleges are the gasoline that power that engine as our baby boomers retire in droves. We have workforce shortages in every category. We have all struggled to schedule a doctor’s appointment, a plumber, an accountant, or even a cleaning at the dentist,” Dassler-Alfheim said. “The purpose of these two bills is to help qualified students access the higher education needed to advance themselves and to fulfill the promise to Wisconsin employers to develop the workforce necessary to maintain and grow Wisconsin’s economy.”
Democratic lawmakers also circulated bill drafts meant to help support staff and faculty at UW system campuses. 
One would again allow most UW system employees, faculty and academic staff to collectively bargain over wages, hours, and conditions of employment. UW employees were stripped of that ability under the Walker-era law Act 10. 
Another bill would reverse changes made in the 2015 state budget that eliminated language in state statute that protected tenure. Lawmakers said in 2015 that the changes were necessary to give the UW system flexibility to deal with budget cuts, though faculty members said then that the changes were an attack on tenure. 
Emerson said it is getting harder to recruit people to work at the universities in the state and that some of the changes could help. 
“If we’re making these big changes about how universities are dealt with, staff and faculty need to have a seat at the table for having these conversations and having a seat at the table in meaningful ways where their concerns are addressed too,” Emerson said. 
Emerson noted that in recent years Republican lawmakers have pushed through proposals and deals that triggered pushback from faculty members. 
The most recent budget deal negotiated between lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers included new work load requirements for UW faculty, mandating that they teach a minimum of 24 credits per academic year, or four 3-credit courses, starting in Sept. 2026. The requirement has garnered concerned reactions from faculty, some of who have said it could be difficult to balance teaching and research demands.
In 2023, Republican lawmakers negotiated with UW leaders to secure concessions on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in exchange for staff pay raises and money for buildings. The deal garnered a lot of pushback from staff and students at the time.
“You know, the workload requirements that came through the budget, or the DEI deal that happened last session, none of those would have happened if we had collective bargaining in place,” Emerson said. “Those are two things that when you have people who don’t work in an industry trying to put working parameters around that industry, it falls flat.”
Bills likely won’t advance in Republican Legislature
The Democratic proposals will face a difficult road in the Republican-led Legislature. Emerson said the likelihood for a public hearing on the Democratic bills is “slim to none.”
However, Emerson said Democratic lawmakers plan to take the ideas to people in the state other ways. She and some of her Democratic colleagues will be on the UW-Stevens Point campus this week to start a tour of campuses around the state. 
Emerson said the purpose is to have as many conversations with staff, faculty and students as possible. 
“If we’re not going to have a hearing in Madison on it, we are ready to take this around to other campuses and other parts of the state and have the conversation on the college campuses,” Emerson said. “I want to hear what matters to the students. I want to hear what, you know, the career people need their students to have to get jobs. I want to hear from the business people in these communities.”
Emerson said part of the goal is to also start laying the foundation for if Democrats win more legislative power in 2026. 
“It’s always good when you’re making policy about something that you’re talking to the people that this is going to impact, so this is what we’re really hoping to do — work out all the kinks, and dust everything off, and, hopefully, have a little bit more governing power coming up in the next session, and be able to really hit the ground running with some of these bills,” Emerson said.
Emerson said Democratic lawmakers’ approach is focused on figuring out how the state can make higher education available for “anybody no matter their zip code, no matter their income level,” and she expressed skepticism the Republican bills will do that. 
“A lot of the bills that I see coming from my Republican colleagues about higher education tend to either be punitive — one person said one thing on one campus, therefore we have to make sure nobody ever says that again and getting into these free speech pieces — or they’re doing things in a way that tells me that they haven’t been on a college campus for a really long time,” Emerson said.
The Senate Universities and Technical Colleges Committee is scheduled to have a public hearing on eight Republican-authored higher education-related bills Wednesday. 
One bill, coauthored by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), would place caps on annual tuition hikes. It was proposed in reaction to the 5% tuition increase that was approved after the recent state budget was completed. The increase was the third annual hike in a row. UW President Jay Rothman and UW regents had said the tuition increases would be necessary if the system didn’t secure enough funding from the state. 
In a memo about the bill, the Republican lawmakers said the Legislature needed to “implement a common sense law placing controls on these types of skyrocketing tuition increases” and that a cap on tuition increases would provide families with “the predictability required to budget for college expenses into the future.” Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) has also argued that the bill is about “protecting affordability.” 
Under the bill, the UW Board of Regents would be prohibited from increasing undergraduate tuition by more than the consumer price index increase in a given year.
Emerson said she didn’t think the bill would have the intended effect of helping students and families afford school. She noted some of the effects seen during the decade-long tuition freeze implemented under the Walker administration. 
UW leaders said at the time that the freeze was unsustainable as it limited campuses ability to maintain its program and course offerings and wages for staff and faculty. 
“Students couldn’t get the classes that they needed… so people would sometimes have to go for an extra year to get all of the classes that they needed to complete their degree. It ended up costing people more because they had to stay in longer to get the one last requirement that they needed for their degree,” Emerson said. “It’s a good messaging point to say we’re gonna not increase [tuition] by a certain amount, but I don’t think that that has the end result that they’re thinking it does.”

Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby made her opinion-writing debut with repeated reminders of recent limits on her powers. Lawmakers in 2024 narrowed the source material for the non-binding opinions to the “plain text” of public access laws and valid Indiana court rulings.
Ruby’s first months in office were marked by complaints of nonresponsiveness. Gov. Mike Braun’s office said that had to tackle a sizable backlog before looking at the current year’s cases.
In her first opinion, issued Sept. 24, Ruby weighed in on a dispute between one Hoosier and the New Carlisle Town Council over economic development project records.

Complainant Debra Durall sought information about water use for Amazon’s data center project — such as nondisclosure agreements and communications between a flurry of parties — and any agreements or communications about the completion of an electric vehicle battery plant under construction by General Motors and Samsung SDI.
Durall sent the town a records request late last year, on Dec. 6. The town’s attorney offered up limited documents on Jan. 2. That included a blank NDA, because the town didn’t have the signed copies, and a redacted copy of a utility service agreement.
The town didn’t have other documents she requested — like those involving officials working for the county or chamber of commerce — and said it had no agreements with GM or Samsung. It withheld other communications, citing confidential attorney work, ongoing negotiations and trade secrets.
Durall filed a formal complaint with Ruby’s office Jan. 29.
Ruby opined that Indiana law doesn’t require governments to create records they don’t have to satisfy records requests. She also defended the redactions — noting statute protects a utility customer’s confidential personal information — and the withholding of the other confidential information.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, for instance, has found that utility customer water usage data can be a confidential trade secret.
“Although Indiana statute only allows the (Office of the Public Access Counselor) to consider public access statutes and case law when issuing advisory opinions, Indiana case law provides that the IURC can be given wide discretion in matters within its jurisdiction,” Ruby wrote. “Therefore, it seems reasonable for the OPAC to consider an IURC opinion when determining whether water usage information has the characteristics outlined by Indiana case law and qualifies as trade secrets.”
She issued an opinion saying the town didn’t break public records law.
Open door dispute
A second opinion, from Oct. 2, involved a township official seemingly iced out by his own colleagues.
Green Township Board Chair George Coffey accused Township Trustee Jon Fletcher of violating meeting access laws — by not telling him soon enough about a Dec. 19 meeting that the board’s other two members had called.
Hoosiers are entitled to notice at least 48 hours before a public agency’s governing body meets. In his Jan. 9 complaint, Coffey said board members usually were notified by email, but that this time, a letter arrived in the mail on the day of the meeting.

Fletcher defended himself in responses to Ruby’s office. He argued Coffey had emailed asking if there was a meeting and that the township attorney had responded Dec. 18 with the date and time. Fletcher also included a photograph showing the letters to all three board members were mailed Dec. 16.
Ruby noted that U.S. mail often takes three-plus for delivery. She argued that that Coffey “was at a disadvantage” — the other two board members knew about the meeting since they’d called it — and that only Coffey was left “in the dark.”
The photograph itself, she added, “leads our office to believe that Respondent knew that mailing the notice and agenda would be an issue.”
She wrote that it’s “unlikely” that the mailed letter or the township attorney’s emailed response were sufficient as written notice — but added, “As the statute is silent on the timeline and method of delivery for written notice … I decline to define ‘sufficient written notice.'”
Ruby opined that Fletcher didn’t violate open door law but that the conduct “violates the spirit of” Indiana Code’s provisions for ad hoc, special meetings. She recommended that the township trustee and board consider adopting a policy to ensure that all board members get consistent notice.
PAC settles in
The opinions represent two of 34 cases that Ruby has resolved as of last week, according to office spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland.
“Resolved is a fluid term,” McFarland noted. “… Some complaints may have been withdrawn, some may have been rejected due to jurisdiction or pending litigation, or the complainant may have received their request or no longer needs it.”

Open government group launching public access hotline, hopes to ease PAC workload

“Receiving and resolving complaints is an ongoing process, so please continue to visit the page above throughout the year for published opinions,” McFarland wrote.
Braun appointed Ruby to the role in late March, after former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, resigned.
“I’d always said that if I found that my voice was getting ineffective, it was time to leave. And that might have been my sign with that legislation,” he told WFYI at the time. House Enrolled Act 1338 also made the PAC serve “at the pleasure of the governor.” Before, one could only be fired “for cause.”
One nonprofit, in July, opened a public access hotline to “alleviate the pressure” on the new PAC.

Rep. John Bear has tried to spin the $700,000 payment to a former librarian as a win for those who want to crack down on Wyoming libraries. We’re not buying it, writes columnist Kerry Drake.
The post Freedom Caucus won’t let a legal settlement stop its First Amendment assault appeared first on WyoFile .","Far-right Wyoming legislators tried during the past three sessions to pass laws to lock up librarians for allegedly making “obscene” books available to children. After that batch of outrageous bills failed, this interim session was devoted to trying to bankrupt school and public libraries that offend them.

Opinion

A draft bill that fined libraries a whopping $50,000 every time an employee made “sexually explicit” material available to a minor was lowered to $500 Monday by the Joint Judiciary Committee.
But while panel members who approved the heavily amended and confusing bill by an 11-2 vote congratulated themselves for a job well done, one of the dissenters pointed out the bill still infringes on parental control by making certain books unavailable to all children.
“You’re creating a bounty reward system where you’re encouraging people to file lawsuits against the library,” said Rep. Ken Chestek, D-Laramie. Such lawsuits would allow plaintiffs to be awarded damages and legal fees.
The bill requires public libraries to relocate books deemed sexually explicit into the adult section, but school libraries do not have adult sections. “This is straight-up book banning,” Chestek said. “No question about it.”
This bill is a way-off-the-charts effort in the state to censor and ban books that has its roots in a 2021 controversy in Gillette over a “Pride” display of LGBTQ-related books at the public library.
The library’s executive director, Terri Lesley, who stood up for the First Amendment and refused to remove the challenged books, was fired in 2023 by the Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees. Before her termination, Lesley told the board that working at the library was her dream job but the last two years were “pure hell.”
Lesley and her staff were branded as pornographers and pedophiles by some members of the public at board meetings, and one family went to local law enforcement to try to get her arrested for violating state obscenity laws. A special prosecutor determined no crimes were committed.
After she was fired, the library board voted to move the books featured in the Pride display and other challenged books to the adult section. It was an expensive “victory” for the far right.
Lesley sued for wrongful termination and reached a $700,000 settlement last week with Campbell County, its commission and six members of the library board. I think she deserved more.


It was vindication for the librarian and her supporters, but it apparently did nothing to deter the extremist Freedom Caucus from going after Wyoming libraries again.
Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, is chairman emeritus of the Freedom Caucus that controls the House, and co-chair of the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee. His wife, Sage Bear, is one of the six Campbell County library board trustees Lesley sued.
In a text message to WyoFile, Bear defended the board’s action and obnoxiously claimed that Lesley “was more concerned about fleecing her prior employer than the supposed altruistic motive of standing up for LGBTQ rights.
“I don’t believe the county’s insurance company or their attorneys should have settled this case, but I understand the business decision to attempt to keep costs of frivolous litigation minimized,” Bear wrote. 
Amazingly, Freedom Caucus leaders like Bear portray themselves as both the victim and the victor whenever their side loses.
Bear whined that Lesley’s case is the reason Wyoming needs to reform its tort laws that govern civil cases, which supposedly allow liberals to file frivolous suits for damages.
Then Bear pretended that somehow the Campbell County Public Library won when it settled the suit.
“Gillette public libraries are the first in the nation to stop the left’s onslaught on the innocence of children by moving books that sexualize children to the adult section of the library,” Bear wrote. “Is $700,000 too much to pay to save our children?”
Lesley’s wrongful termination had absolutely nothing to do with saving children. It was about appeasing a group of people who do not want the LGBTQ community represented in the books available at the Gillette library. 
Our society doesn’t work that way. Public resources should be inclusive and open to diverse groups.
Parents have the right to determine what books their children read, and most school districts have policies that allow parents to “opt-in” and allow their child to read a controversial book. Legislators can’t allow one set of parents to decide what all children should read.
But that’s effectively what they’re attempting to do with their latest library bill. The Joint Judiciary Committee, at the urging of Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, decided in June to draft a bill to ban sexually explicit material from children’s sections in libraries. 
This was a significant change in approach from previous Freedom Caucus bills, which sought to repeal the exemption librarians, educators and museum workers now have from being charged with obscenity crimes for performing their job duties.
Under the earlier bills, the state established that materials may be deemed obscene if the average person applying contemporary standards would find it appeals to the prurient interest. The work must also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value” to be obscene. 
The committee’s bill, however, covers “sexually explicit” material, going into graphic detail to list any sex acts between two or more people.
Bill supporters want to keep LGBTQ-related books off the children’s shelves, especially ones aimed at the far-right’s favorite target, transgender individuals. These banned books would be unavailable to the people they were written for, teens who may be struggling with their own gender identity and want information.
Opponents say the bill would force libraries to move into the adult section all educational material about puberty and sex, historical books like “The Diary of Anne Frank,” and religious texts like the Bible, Quran and Book of Mormon.
Allowing libraries to be sued for allowing a book in the children’s section that describes any sex act, no matter the context, would have a chilling effect on libraries’ book purchases. What library official would take a chance ordering a book that has been challenged anywhere that could cause economic harm to the entire library and its staff, plus deprive patrons of their First Amendment right to decide what to read?
Before going to the polls during next year’s primary elections, do your homework. Research which candidates have voted to make libraries effectively ban books for fear of retaliation, or allow parents to make reading decisions for other people’s kids. Then vote them out.
Do it in the name of Terri Lesley. Do it in the name of all defenders of the First Amendment.

Jim Pillen before his press conference at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sept. 29, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Nebraska moves forward in converting a McCook state prison into an ICE detention center, concerns grow about the Governor’s Office stonewalling public requests seeking more about what is going on.
By late September, Gov. Jim Pillen’s office had denied at least nine public records requests asking for information about the state’s negotiations with the federal government regarding the McCook Work Ethic Camp, records obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicate. Additionally, there’s evidence that broader requests on the subject have also been denied, although some state agencies, including the prison system, have released some records.
These denials raised the eyebrows of local activists and legal experts who say they are suspicious that potentially thousands of public records could be withheld under the governor’s justifications. Though there is little evidence of wrongdoing, the lack of information on a subject that involves a state prison and state funds makes some believe the state has something to hide.
“Whether or not they file an open records request, people are calling out for this information and are entitled to understand what their government is doing in their name,” said Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. “The interest in obscuring that information completely … is really suspect, and the motivation for that needs to be questioned.”

Meanwhile, Nebraska is well underway in transitioning the McCook property into a jail that holds migrant detainees for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said just over 60 of the 180 men the camp typically holds remained housed there as of Oct. 8.
Charlie McPherson, executive director with the McCook Economic Development Corp., said his team is “keeping eyes and ears open for more information,” and hasn’t gotten any fresh info from the city or state. “Just sitting tight.” He said driving by the camp, he noticed fencing work being done.
Talks between state officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the Work Ethic Camp have been going since at least late March, according to documents the government watchdog group Common Cause Nebraska acquired from the Department of Corrections.
News of the plan broke in late August. In early September, Pillen administration staffers revealed in a closed-door briefing that state officials initiated conversations with the federal government regarding the possibility of helping ICE.
At the time, State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington said she was told state leaders expect a written agreement between Nebraska and the federal government to be completed within 60 days.
Though it’s still within the 60-day window, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha said he’s heard from several sources that the state has already signed the contract and is waiting for a federal response. There has been no official confirmation as yet. Homeland Security operations continue during a government shutdown that could limit some ICE actions.
The Nebraska Examiner filed a public records request of its own Sept. 5 for communications between Pillen, his staff, and Homeland Security officials about the deal. The Governor’s Office responded to the request Sept. 18, well past the four-day deadline laid out in statute for how long state agencies have to respond.
In its response, the office denied the request based on four justifications:

The documents requested constitute “proprietary or commercial information.”
The documents requested constitute “negotiation records for the lease or sale of an interest in real property.”
The documents requested constitute “confidential communications.”
Cited a statute outlining the rules for lawyer-client privilege.

The Examiner sent a follow-up request on Sept. 22 seeking how the Governor’s Office responded to related requests from others. The office requested an extension and fulfilled the request on Oct. 8.
The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s. All were denied, and seven of the nine were denied with virtually identical reasonings — those listed above. The requests were made by a range of individuals, including reporters, private citizens and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha.

But the state’s justifications for denying the requests are questionable, according to multiple legal experts who spoke with the Examiner, including Houlden and Daniel Gutman, a lawyer who has litigated several public records disputes. Houlden said she believes the exceptions government agencies are granted under law are being applied more broadly than they ought to be.
“(The governor’s office) tends to blur lines when it comes to interpretations,” said Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska.
Geis argued that the first two justifications treat the dealings between two public bodies — the Nebraska state government and the federal government — as though both are private businesses. Houlden noted the exact language of one of the cited statutes grants an exception for records that would “give advantage to business competitors and serve no public purpose” if they were made public, which makes her believe that the exception should not apply.
Houlden said the second justification contradicts previous public statements state officials have made that Nebraska will continue to own and operate the McCook facility.
Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted. Though Gutman said this isn’t a legally binding principle, there is a legal obligation for state officials to “understand and apply the exceptions in light of a broader public policy that favors disclosure.”
The Governor’s Office declined an interview for this story but sent a written statement.
“The Governor’s Office has responded to all record requests submitted about WEC and its transition to becoming a federal detention center,” Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple wrote. “The process followed was the same as for any record request. Records have been provided to each requestor within the scope of law, which also allows for withholding information that meets specific exceptions.”
Gutman equated questionable public records responses to “the chicken or the egg” paradox, because while there is cause to suspect the Governor’s Office is withholding records that should be public, there is no way to know for certain without seeing the records being withheld.
There are legitimate reasons to withhold government records, Gutman said. The question is: Do those reasons apply to the potentially thousands of records that pertain to the WEC negotiations? Gutman said he thinks that’s unlikely.
Nebraska law treats most public documents as public records. According to the Attorney General’s Office, exceptions to the state’s public records statutes include personal information on students, medical records other than about births or deaths, trade secrets, investigatory records, vulnerabilities involving public property, firearms registration information and cybersecurity info.
A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated. The main option is suing in Lancaster District Court, which Gutman said at best can take two to three months to resolve, or longer if the state appeals.
The state also recommends requesters petition the Attorney General’s Office for a review if they believe an error was made in their response.
In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of the governor and other state agencies, said she believes Pillen’s office is banking on the assumption that most people won’t take them to court.
Cavanaugh acknowledged that hesitation over public records requests is not a problem specific to Pillen’s administration but argued it has gotten worse since he took office. Former governor turned U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., didn’t make the process easy, but he returned requests and allowed room for negotiations, she said.
When reached by the Examiner, McCook City Council members said they agreed to direct all questions on the McCook conversion to Molly Smith, a city spokesperson who did not return calls. McCook Mayor Linda Taylor also did not return calls.
State Sen. David Murman, whose legislative district includes McCook, said he had no fresh update. He supports the project and President Trump’s efforts to secure the border, he said, and believes many of his constituents do also.
Cavanaugh, along with fellow Appropriations Committee member State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, requested that the committee hold a public briefing to better understand the transition process and its financial implications for the state. They were denied by committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who said there will be opportunity to discuss the topic when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
Judiciary Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln also has denied requests for public hearings about the Work Ethic Camp.
The Urban Affairs Committee, chaired by McKinney, held a public hearing in September at the Capitol, which drew a large enough crowd that it required an overflow area. This is part of the “far-reaching consequences” Geis said come with withholding information on matters of high public interest. It limits the opportunities for voters to make informed decisions.
On the flip side, he said, it also keeps voters in the dark about good decisions their government is making. In this way, Geis argued Pillen could benefit from being more forthcoming.
“When they close the door, we can only assume that what’s happening back there is not to our benefit,” Geis said.

On Sept. 30, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission issued a decision approving new reimbursement rates called export credit rates that Idaho Power pays its rooftop solar customers. 
In April, Idaho Power officials applied for a larger decrease in the reimbursement rate. 
But the commission, which regulates utility companies in Idaho, approved a smaller decrease in the reimbursement rates after expressing concern about the impact on rooftop solar customers.
“The commission recognized that all customers have faced increases to their average monthly bills over the past 18 months, and the proposed update to the (export credit rate) would further affect customers in Schedules 6, 8 and 84,” the Idaho Public Utilities Commission said in a news release issued Oct. 2.
The new decreased reimbursement applies to about 14,000 Idaho Power customers who had rooftop solar systems or other on-site generation systems installed after Dec. 20, 2020. Customers who had a rooftop solar system, or other system installed before Dec. 20, 2020, are considered legacy customers and are not subject to the new reimbursement rate, officials said. 
Rooftop solar systems are the most common type of on-site generation systems among Idaho Power customers, but other types of on-site generation systems include wind and power systems, officials said. 
Idaho Power is a Boise-based electric utility company that serves more than 650,000 customers. About 20,000 Idaho Power customers have a rooftop solar system, a company spokesman said.
The decreased reimbursement rate that Idaho Power is paying its rooftop solar customers comes as Idaho Power is also seeking to increase the rates it charges its electricity customers by $199 million, or 13%, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The Idaho Public Utilities Commission is accepting public comment on the proposed rate increase for residential electricity customers though Nov. 20.  
 



 Reimbursement rates Idaho Power requested vs. approximate rates the Idaho Public Utilities Commission approved


Summer peak rates: 14.0598 cents per kilowatt hour vs 15.68 cents per kilowatt hour

 Why did Idaho Power want to change the reimbursement rate it pays rooftop solar customers?

Idaho Power Communications Specialist Jordan Rodriguez said the company sought the change in reimbursement rates to more accurately reflect energy costs and avoid overcompensating rooftop solar customers.
Rodriguez said that in the beginning, rooftop solar customers were compensated for excess energy they pushed back on the grid at the same retail rate that customers paid per kilowatt hours on their electric bills. 
Rodriquez said the problem with that is the full reimbursement rate did not take into account expenses Idaho Power has for providing power to its customers, like maintaining and operating the grid and employing the people who operate it.
“When some customers are being overcompensated with the full retail rate credit, the difference is made up by the rest of our customers, 98% of which do not have rooftop solar or other on-site generation,” Rodriguez said, adding that Idaho Power followed the process the Idaho Public Utilities Commission put in place for updating rates.  
 Idaho Power’s application to change rooftop solar rates received widespread opposition

Idaho Power’s proposal to decrease compensation rates for rooftop solar customers was met with widespread public opposition from rooftop solar customers, environmental groups and Idaho residents. 
Several customers who use rooftop solar systems filed written comments urging the Idaho Public Utilities Commission to reject the change in reimbursement rates.
“My household made the decision to invest in solar panels because we believe in the power of clean energy,” Boise customer Wayne Rysavy wrote to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission in May. “We wanted to harness Idaho’s abundant sunshine, lower our long-term energy costs and do our part to reduce reliance on energy sources that are less environmentally friendly. Idaho Power’s proposal not only threatens the value of that investment, it also sends the wrong message to families and individuals trying to make responsible energy choices.”
Others agreed.
“Considering the urgency of climate change, it would greatly help to encourage solar panels rather than disincentivizing them,” Sandpoint customer Gabrielle Duebendorfer wrote to state regulators in June.
The city of Boise filed public comments asking the Idaho Public Utilities Commission not to approve Idaho Power’s proposed decrease and instead set rates that are fair and affordable and consider the long-term impact on customers who invested in solar systems. 
The Sierra Club, which publicly opposed decreasing the rooftop solar reimbursement rates, said there were nearly 1,000 written comments filed in opposition to Idaho Power’s application. 
“Even though we’re opposed to these solar rate changes, we appreciate the adjustments the PUC made to Idaho Power’s original proposal to help reduce the impact on customer power bills,” Lisa Young, director of the Idaho Chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a written statement. “Energy affordability is an increasingly important issue in Idaho, and the PUC has a key role to play in ensuring that our monopoly utilities don’t unfairly raise our bills. We will continue pushing the PUC to listen to Idaho ratepayers and prioritize fair rates moving forward.”
Following the Idaho Public Utilities Commission’s order, the change went into effect on Oct. 1. As part of its decision, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission also paused updates to the reimbursement rates until 2028, officials said.

Then one of those officers stepped forward and told him to stand 25 feet away because he was violating a new Tennessee law that allows police to create a buffer zone for any of their interactions, according to video reviewed by the Lookout.
“They are explicitly trying to remove accountability for police across the state,” said Demster, a leader with the group Free the 901, a coalition of advocacy groups organizing against federal and state law enforcement’s presence in Memphis.
At the end of September, President Donald Trump and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee established the “Memphis Safe Task Force” that brought in an additional 700 law enforcement officers, according to a report by the Daily Memphian. The task force includes a combination of federal and state agencies, like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the ATF, the FBI, the Tennessee Highway Patrol, the state National Guard and more.
The heightened presence of enforcement comes with little detail from officials about the task force’s exact orders and their operational areas.
In an executive order issued by Trump on Sept. 15, the president said the objective of the task was to “end street and violent crime in Memphis to the greatest possible extent,” adding they would accomplish this through “hypervigilant policing, aggressive prosecution, complex investigations, financial enforcement, and large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel.”
National Guard members were seen patrolling a popular commercial area after arriving in Memphis on Friday and there have been reports of an increase in immigration raids and stop-and-frisk policing.

What is the buffer law?
In 2025, Tennessee lawmakers passed the buffer law, allowing law enforcement officers engaged in official duties at a traffic stop, crime scene or “an ongoing and immediate threat to public safety” to create the 25-foot zone even if the person in question doesn’t pose a safety risk or is not obstructing law enforcement.
Anyone in violation of the law can be charged with a misdemeanor. 
The Tennessee law is similar to those passed in Indiana and Louisiana, which two federal courts have ruled unconstitutional due to the laws’ vague nature in allowing police broad discretion to create buffer zones. 
Both states are appealing the decisions. 
In Tennessee, seven news organizations filed a federal lawsuit arguing that the law grants law enforcement officers limitless authority to bar journalists and the public from reporting on protests and other newsworthy events. The Lookout is a plaintiff in the lawsuit.
Demster has been told at least three times by law enforcement working with the Memphis Safe Task Force that he must remain at least 25 feet away from police interactions, according to videos reviewed by the Lookout.
“The second I walked up with a camera, that’s the first words out of their mouths,” he said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) Key Tennessee lawmakers are taking different views toward Gov. Bill Lee’s desire to expand the state’s new private-school voucher program. 
House Speaker Cameron Sexton is gung-ho about an increase, saying he wants to double the number of students who receive the state funds when lawmakers return to the Capitol in 2026, according to Chalkbeat Tennessee.
But Lt. Gov. Randy McNally declined to say he supports such an increase in the program and was leery about the impact on the state budget.
“I anticipate there will be legislation to augment the current Education Freedom Scholarship program next session. While there is clearly an appetite to expand, until we start examining the overall budget and revenue numbers it would be premature to commit to any specific scope,” McNally, a former Senate finance committee chairman, said in a Monday statement.
Vouchers worth $7,300 each for 20,000 students are costing the state $144 million in the program’s first year. Doubling that amount could prove difficult as the legislature tries to buoy the budget amid two years of business tax reductions and rebates. Lawmakers also approved one-year bonuses for public school teachers to try to gain their support before a tight vote during a January special session.
The state received 42,000 applications for the voucher funds this year but couldn’t award all of them because of a cap on the number of recipients. Of those 20,000, half went to families without an income limit, and half were designated for students from families with incomes at 300% of the free or reduced-price lunch guidelines, more than $173,000 for a family of four.
Nearly two-thirds of the vouchers went to students in five counties, Shelby (3,738), Knox (2,924), Hamilton (2,458), Davidson (1,684) and Williamson (876), according to the Tennessee Journal.
The Department of Education is declining to release the number of private-school students who received the money, saying that information wasn’t required from applicants.
Lee was surrounded by students from private schools in the Capitol when he signed the measure into law this year, leading critics of the legislation to call it a private-school “subsidy.”
The governor, in contrast, said recently he is satisfied the vouchers were “widespread” as the state awarded them to students attending 200 of 220 schools that qualified for the program. 
“The only thing I’m not happy with is that we don’t have more scholarships to give to more income-limited, low-income families and families that aren’t limited in their income,” Lee said.
The governor added that because of the large number of applications, he hopes to persuade the legislature to “provide more scholarships to Tennessee families” when lawmakers return for the 2026 session.
The law contains a provision already allowing lawmakers to add 5,000 students to the program if the number of applications hits 75% of the number of vouchers available.
Lee, whose term runs out in January 2027, wasn’t specific about how much he would like to see the program expand. But Sexton’s spokesperson, Connor Grady, said the speaker is committed to “at least doubling” the number of available vouchers to meet student demand, Chalkbeat reported.
Nashville Rep. John Ray Clemmons, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, criticized the move Monday, saying the voucher program is expected to have its biggest impact on the budget in two to three years when the state is committed to paying for more students to attend private schools and public schools lose enrollment.
“Bill Lee has lost his damn mind,” Clemmons said in a statement. “Our state is teetering on the edge of a fiscal cliff due to Lee and Republicans’ fiscal recklessness and now he wants to double the size of the most expensive and unpopular Republican welfare program in recent history.”
Clemmons, who recently toured the state, said officials from multiple rural areas told him the voucher program and other “irresponsible schemes” are causing job cuts and property tax increase proposals.

Aurora voters in November will choose from among a dozen council candidates. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Backed by conservative dark money groups, Republicans in Colorado’s third-largest city are looking to expand their council majority in the 2025 off-year election.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Though Aurora’s elections are officially nonpartisan, slates of Republican-affiliated candidates led by Mayor Mike Coffman, a former GOP member of Congress, have solidified their grip on city politics in recent years — even as the sprawling, diverse suburb east of Denver became an unlikely target of national attention over false and exaggerated claims of immigrant gang activity.
Candidates up for reelection in 2025 include at-large Council member Danielle Jurinsky, whose tales of a “complete gang takeover” of Aurora were instrumental in drawing President Donald Trump to the city for a high-profile 2024 campaign stop. Trump, Jurinsky and other far-right figures painted a sensational picture of the influence of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in Aurora, where police have described the gang’s presence as “isolated” and relatively small, and crime rates, consistent with national trends, have trended downward since 2022.
Jurinsky and four other conservative Aurora City Council candidates are backed by Building Aurora’s Future, an independent expenditure committee that has raised a combined $295,000 this year from Advance Colorado and Our Community Our Future, two dark money groups that do not disclose their donors.

Advance Colorado is a prominent conservative group that funds anti-tax ballot measures and other Republican-aligned causes in Colorado politics.
Our Community Our Future is a nonprofit incorporated in Colorado in 2023. In tax filings, it lists former Aurora City Council member Charlie Richardson as its lone board member. Its bare-bones website consists of a single sentence describing the group as seeking to “advance the mission of community building,” and a stock photo titled “Group of people support unity arm around together.”
No Democratic-aligned groups have reported any expenditures on behalf of Aurora municipal candidates this year.
Ballots began going out by mail Oct. 10 to all active registered voters in Colorado. The state’s coordinated 2025 election features two statewide ballot measures, Proposition LL and Proposition MM. Depending on where they live, voters will also be asked to weigh in on such items as local ballot issues, city council races, and school board races.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.
Overall, 12 candidates are vying for five City Council seats in Aurora’s 2025 municipal election. Voters will also have the final say on five citywide measures referred to the ballot by council members.
 At-Large seats
Five candidates are running for two at-large seats, including the two incumbents: Jurinsky, who was elected to her seat in 2021, and Amsalu Kassaw, a Republican-affiliated member appointed to fill a vacancy on council by its conservative majority last year.
Kassaw is an Ethiopian immigrant who works for The GEO Group, a private prison company that operates the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora. Jurinsky and Kassaw are part of the slate backed by Building Aurora’s Future, and both lead the field of at-large candidates in individual fundraising, having received $250,740 and $101,908 in contributions, respectively, as of Sept. 30.
Two Democratic-affiliated candidates, Rob Andrews and Alli Jackson, have received endorsements from a long list of progressive groups and Democratic elected officials. Andrews, president of the nonprofit job-training service CommunityWorks, has raised $45,262, according to campaign finance disclosures. Jackson, a social worker, has raised $15,114.
An independent candidate, Community College of Aurora instructor Watson Gomes, has raised $610.
 Ward I
Three candidates are running for the Ward I seat being vacated by progressive Council member Crystal Murillo. Ward I is centered on the East Colfax corridor in northwest Aurora.
Murillo, who was elected in 2021 with 56% of the vote, has endorsed Gianina Horton, a former executive director of the Denver Justice Project. Horton also has the backing of the Colorado Working Families Party, Colorado People’s Action, Conservation Colorado and other progressive groups and elected officials.
Stephen Elkins, a product development manager for a data center business, is the conservative slate’s pick for the Ward I seat and has received support from Building Aurora’s Future.
Reid Hettich, a pastor at Mosaic Church of Aurora, is also running for the Ward I seat.
 Ward II
Incumbent Council member Steve Sundberg, a Republican, is running for reelection in Ward II, which encompasses Aurora’s sprawling northeastern quarter, extending as far as Denver International Airport to the north and the town of Bennett to the east.
Sundberg is part of the conservative slate supported by Building Aurora’s Future. He won his seat with a 48% plurality of the vote in a four-way race in 2021.
His lone challenger in 2025, Amy Wiles, is backed by Democratic elected officials and progressive groups including the Colorado AFL-CIO, the Colorado Working Families Party and Moms Demand Action.
 Ward III
Incumbent Council member Ruben Medina, a Democrat, is running for reelection in Ward III, which includes much of central Aurora along its border with Denver to the west. Medina narrowly won election to his seat with 51% of the vote in a head-to-head race in 2021.
His 2025 challenger is Marsha Berzins, a conservative who previously held the Ward III seat for 12 years before she was term-limited in 2021. Berzins is part of the conservative slate and has received support from Building Aurora’s Future.
 Ballot questions
Alongside the City Council races, Aurora voters will vote on five citywide ballot questions, referred by council members earlier this year.

Ballot Question 3B would amend the city charter to use gender-neutral language.
Ballot Question 3C would amend the city’s process for filling council vacancies, requiring special elections to fill any vacancy that occurs one year or more before the next election for the seat in question.
Ballot Question 3D proposes to eliminate the requirement that Aurora’s city manager must reside within city limits.
Ballot Question 3E would remove the city charter’s prohibition on elected city officials simultaneously holding another elected office.
Ballot Question 3F would amend the charter to allow at-large council seats and ward council seats to count as separate offices for the purposes of term limits.

Some Aurora residents within a designated area along East Colfax Avenue will vote on two ballot measures to create and fund a new downtown development authority, a taxing district to foster economic development along the corridor.

West Virginia Health Right’s annual #WeCareWV Day will be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 18 at its East End clinic, 1520 Washington Street East in Charleston, West Virginia. 
During the pop-up clinic, volunteer medical and dental professionals will provide free teeth cleaning, fillings, eye exams and glasses, hearing screenings and other medical and dental care. 
This is the second year Health Right has hosted the event on its own. In previous years, the free and charitable clinic partnered with Remote Area Medical to offer an annual two-day free pop-up clinic. 
West Virginia Health Right typically provides care to about 46,000 people annually who don’t have insurance and make below 250% of the federal poverty level. On Saturday, no one attending the clinic will need to prove their income or that they don’t have health insurance, CEO Angie Settle said. 
“We understand there are people out there that have insurance, and they have deductibles and copays and things that are preventing them from getting that care,” she said. “So we don’t want anything like that to get in the way that day.”
Last year, the clinic treated more than 500 people during the event.  
Settle said vision and dental care are big needs in the community. Last year, the clinic treated many people for medical problems too, she said. 
“Even people that have insurance, sometimes it doesn’t cover preventative exams and things like that,” she said. “So it’s really important that [people] have this opportunity. We have people that come every year and they use it as their preventive service, because things are so expensive.” 
Settle said the clinic will see as many people as it can Saturday based on the number of volunteers who help. As of Monday, between 250 and 300 people have signed up to volunteer, she said. The clinic is always looking for more, she said. 
“It’s everything from nurses, doctors, pharmacists, dentists, eye doctors — you name it,” Settle said. “Lay people, lots of kids in the community, like high school kids, are wanting to volunteer, especially those interested in the medical field.
“It’s a great opportunity, I think, for everybody to get out and really get to know their community and understand that there’s real need,” Settle said.

(Photo by John Gray/Verite News)Louisiana’s first alternative program to certify teachers of English learners will seek final approval Wednesday from the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in hopes of addressing a shortage of teachers serving the state’s growing English learning student population.
TeachNOLA is an alternative teacher preparation program that recruits locally, providing certification pathways for teaching and special education. If approved, the TeachNOLA program would provide a more affordable way for teachers to become certified to teach English language learners, compared to traditional certification courses housed in universities.
The initiative comes as the Trump administration rolls back education and support programming for students, leaving much of the burden to train educators for English learners to states.
The state has seen some of the largest growth across the country in the number of English language learners it serves, according to a recent report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. The number of English language learners in the greater New Orleans area has also grown in recent years, with 13% of New Orleans students and 39% of Jefferson Parish students identifying as Hispanic as of the 2023-24 school year.
Schools haven’t kept up with that growth rate, said Angela Ramirez, the executive director of Latine youth support group Puentes New Orleans.
Ramirez has noticed that local districts don’t have enough teachers who are trained to provide education to English learners, and that resources for such students can be scarce. Ramirez said that ESL programs are not effectively staffed or implemented to actually create a difference in outcome for Spanish-speaking students.
In 2023, only 33% of English-learning students graduated from high school in New Orleans, compared to a 77% overall district graduation rate.
“[English learners] still need that culturally responsive teaching and advising, and some of the schools are not able to provide that, and that has to do with a shortage of bilingual teachers and advisors,” Ramirez said.
Hiring rates for New Orleans public school teachers have increased recently, but two months after the beginning of the school year, the NOLA Public Schools district still had a shortage of 83 teachers. About a third of those vacancies were in specialized roles, with 18 openings in special education and nine in teaching English learners.
If approved, the new program will launch at the beginning of next school year and follow the blueprint TeachNOLA has for its other certification courses, which include a yearlong residency program and mentoring opportunities. The program will be fully online to be accessible to interested educators across the state.
All of TeachNOLA’s programs cost around $4,700, but many teachers only pay around $200 after state and private scholarships, Pereda said. Some districts and charter operators subsidize certification for teachers. A traditional certification pathway for teaching English learners at Tulane University can cost over $6,000.
Milton Pereda, the senior manager of instruction at TeachNOLA, said that the alternative certification is an effective tool at retaining teachers.
“TeachNOLA recruits local people, because we know one of the big factors of staying is feeling like you’re connected to a school community, which also means you’re connected to the city that you live and work in,” Pereda said.
Still, low pay continues to be an issue nationwide for specialized teachers, including those who are trained to work with English learning students.
The report from the National Council on Teacher Quality recommended that Louisiana provide differential pay of at least $5,000 and expand scholarships and loan forgiveness to recruit and retain specialized educators.
Many teachers for English language learners, Ramirez said, burn out and start teaching elsewhere or leave education altogether.
“If you are a talented bilingual teacher, you’re going to have plenty of opportunities, you’re going to have plenty of offers, and unfortunately we end up losing some of our best talent,” Ramirez said. “And the ones that have stayed are immensely attached or immensely devoted to these kids.”

Republished with ProPublica’s permission.
On a sweltering morning in Vidalia, Louisiana, Shannan Cornwell and Freddie Green got in a long line to wait for food.
The couple has struggled to pay for groceries amid soaring prices and health setbacks, they said. She had back surgery. He had undergone cancer treatment.
They turned to a local food bank to supplement their diets. Although they’re grateful for the food, lately they’ve noticed changes in what they receive. For months in the spring and summer their pickups did not include any meat, Cornwell said.
“You have to learn how to adapt to what you have,” Green said. “Which is hard,” Cornwell added.
In the spring, the Trump administration abruptly cut $500 million in deliveries from a program that sends U.S.-produced meat, dairy, eggs and produce to food banks and other organizations across the country — about a quarter of the funding the program received in 2024. The items that were delivered through The Emergency Food Assistance Program were some of the healthiest, most expensive items that organizations distribute.

The cancellation of these deliveries comes at a critical time for food banks. Food insecurity is higher than at any time since the aftermath of the Great Recession, according to federal data, and many food banks are reporting higher need than they saw at the peak of the pandemic. Demand is only expected to increase; this summer, President Donald Trump signed into law the largest cut to food stamps in the program’s history.
ProPublica obtained records from the Department of Agriculture of each planned delivery in 2025, detailing the millions of pounds of food, down to the number of eggs, that never reached hungry people because of the administration’s cut.
The cancellations began in mid-May, when over 100 orders of 2% milk bound for 31 states were halted.
The records show 4,304 canceled deliveries between May and September across the 50 states, Puerto Rico and D.C. (Experience this as an interactive story on ProPublica’s website.)



				According to the data, North Carolina lost out on 97 canceled shipments of requested food aid. That amounts to 2,921,900 pounds, or 1,461 tons.			


All told, the deliveries accounted for nearly 94 million pounds of food. The true loss is likely greater, food banks said, because not all of the year’s deliveries had been scheduled.
Most food banks rely on a combination of federal or state dollars, private giving and partnerships with businesses that donate leftover food. While the cancellations were disruptive to all food banks, according to their representatives, those that receive state funding or have strong community support said that they have weathered the cuts better than others.
The Food Bank of Central Louisiana, where Cornwell and Green’s groceries come from, gets more than half of its food from the federal government and receives very little state support. It serves rural areas of Louisiana, which has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to U.S. census data.
The Trump administration canceled 10 orders for the food bank totaling over $400,000 of pork, chicken, cheese, dried cranberries, dried plums, milk and eggs, records show. The food bank has struggled to keep up with demand following the cuts and a decrease in private donations. Staff told ProPublica they used to distribute 25-pound packages of food, but over the summer, some packages shrank to about half of that weight.
The longtime director of The Food Bank of Central Louisiana told ProPublica the organization’s warehouses are emptier than usual. (Photo: Stephanie Mei-Ling/ ProPublica)
“We’re not turning people away with no food. It’s not to that point,” said Jayne Wright-Velez, who has been the executive director at the food bank for 30 years. “But people are getting less food when they come to us.”
The organization has tried to fill the gap with produce donations, but transporting and distributing fruits and vegetables is challenging, and multiple patrons told ProPublica the produce had gone bad by the time they received it.
On a recent morning, Codie Dufrene, 23, came to collect food for her grandfather and his neighbors, who live 45 minutes from the closest grocery store.
Usually, the trunk of Dufrene’s car would be full. Not lately.
Dufrene received chicken for the first time “since way before the summer.” But the poultry came from a donation that hardly made up for the 74,000 pounds of chicken that never arrived in June.
She said that though her family is grateful and will use whatever they get, the quality of the food can be discouraging. Dufrene pointed out the condition of a cantaloupe she received. “You can tell — they’re frozen and they’re already super, super soft.” She said her mother would likely give them to her pigs, “because people can’t really eat those.”
Wright-Velez said the food bank trains its staff on food safety and does its best to check everything before it goes out, but it’s difficult to do at a large scale. “Especially in the heat of the summer, things just go bad so quickly,” she said. “The clock’s ticking as soon as we get the donation.”
The Emergency Food Assistance Program was created in 1983 to purchase farmers’ surplus food and distribute it to low-income people. The program’s budget is typically authorized every five years as part of the Farm Bill, but in 2018, the first Trump administration added funds to help farmers struggling under retaliatory tariffs the U.S. faced amid trade disputes. The additional, discretionary federal funds helped food banks serve more people; last fiscal year, they got nearly twice as much money from the fund as they did from their congressional allocation.
Now characterizing the additional funding as a “Biden-era slush fund,” the second Trump administration cut $500 million that had already been allocated. The government is still distributing food through other parts of the program, but food banks were caught off guard by the canceled deliveries because it’s rare for funding to be cut mid-year. Food bank managers, some with decades of experience, couldn’t recall a disruption like it. With the Farm Bill slated for renewal this fall, officials who run food banks worry that any additional cuts would cause them to have to scale back the number of people they serve.
Already the need is greater than what food banks have on hand, said Shannon Oliver, the director of operations at the Oregon Food Bank.
“We’re having to kind of prepare for the fact that there’s just not going to be enough food, and having to be clear with setting the expectation that we’re doing everything we possibly can,” she said.
The USDA did not respond to questions or requests for comment. In a May letter responding to senators’ concerns about the funding cut, the agency said it had made additional food purchases through another program and that the emergency food program continues to operate “as originally intended by Congress.”
“While the pandemic is over, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not and will not lose focus on its core mission of strengthening food security, supporting agricultural markets, and ensuring access to nutritious foods,” the letter said.
### The Need Continues to Grow
By 8 a.m., the line in the parking lot of a library in Albuquerque, New Mexico, snaked around a chain-link fence. People had been waiting for hours to pick up groceries from Roadrunner Food Bank, which lost about 850,000 pounds of food to the funding cut, according to USDA records. As a result, people are receiving less dairy, meat and other high-protein items.
New Mexico consistently ranks among the poorest states in the nation, and it has more food bank distribution sites than full-service grocery stores, according to data provided by the USDA and Roadrunner Food Bank. And in recent months, organizers have noticed more people showing up than usual.

“They’re having to run from place to place to place to try to stitch together enough coverage for their family,” said Katy Anderson, a vice president at the food bank.
Vivian Santiago, 54, pieces together what she can from food-distribution sites across Albuquerque. She also uses her benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to feed her daughter and 9-year-old granddaughter. Lately her electronic benefits card isn’t lasting even halfway through the month because of the increase in grocery prices, which have risen nearly 30% since February 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“It’s hard out there,” she said.

Parker has been homeless for about six months, sometimes sleeping in her car or staying with friends. She’s looking for a job after a recent stint at a laundromat didn’t work out. As she carried Doritos, green grapes, potatoes and onions from the Albuquerque food bank, she said she appreciates the help.

“I won’t have to go days without food,” she said.
Workers at food banks and pantries said that the canceled deliveries add to the growing challenges they face. Many staff members said they had seen a decline in private contributions and volunteers. Grocery stores and food manufacturers, which started managing their inventories more efficiently during the pandemic, now have less leftover food to give. Other Trump cuts have disrupted AmeriCorps, which helps staff mobile food pantries and other services, and are ending the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided food from local farmers.
Food banks with more resources can be more creative. Several told ProPublica they’ve hired someone whose job is to find grocery stores in the area willing to donate food. But in areas where grocers are scarce, there are fewer options. In some cases, food banks are among the only places where people can get fresh fruits and vegetables.
“When we see federal cuts like this, that affects entire communities and villages and towns,” said Stephanie Sullivan, assistant director of marketing and communications at Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves 93 counties across Nebraska and western Iowa.
### “There’s Not an Option B”
Cuts and changes to foundational federal programs for low-income people — namely, SNAP and Medicaid — are a looming concern. The increase in need even before these changes take effect could signal that food banks are a “canary in the coal mine” for what’s to come, said Christopher Bosso, a food policy expert at Northeastern University and the author of a book on SNAP.
Hunger will also be harder to measure now that the USDA has canceled an annual food insecurity survey, calling it “redundant” and “politicized.”
“It feels like the idea is to make it harder to identify the consequences of the policy changes that we’re seeing right now,” said Marlene Schwartz, the director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health at the University of Connecticut.
Food bank administrators emphasized that they could not fill the gap created by benefit cuts in the administration’s multitrillion-dollar spending bill. Feeding America, a national nonprofit association of food banks and other organizations, estimates that for every meal its food banks provide, SNAP provides nine. The majority of people who receive food assistance also receive Medicaid, so reductions in both programs could force people to choose between health care and groceries.

The legislation cuts SNAP by $187 billion, or 20%, through 2034, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The bill, which has expanded work requirements for some recipients and taken protections away from others, will also increase the amount of money that states must contribute to the program for the first time in decades. Experts say it’s unclear how cash-strapped states will be able to shoulder that cost.
Two experts on food insecurity told ProPublica that hunger is expected to rise with the new program rules as it has when SNAP spending has been reduced in the past. There could also be ripple effects: Research has shown that people enrolled in SNAP are less likely to be hospitalized. And grocery stores where the majority of customers use these benefits could close, said Gina Plata-Nino, the interim SNAP director for the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit that works to eradicate hunger.
The people who are harmed are “working incredibly hard,” Plata-Nino said.
“They are Americans who are falling on hard times and just need those resources to be able to have economic mobility and be able to escape poverty,” she said. “Without those resources, it just makes them even poorer and less equipped to be able to handle the tough economy that all of us are facing now.”
Michael Heaton, 76, takes care of his 31-year-old son, who has autism; the two live off Heaton’s Social Security and his son’s disability payments. After the pandemic, Heaton, who is retired, said he saw his SNAP benefits shrink from $600 a month to just over $100. To supplement their diets, he goes to pantries and food-distribution centers around Albuquerque.
On a recent morning, he picked up two bags. “This fills that gap,” he said. “We only take what we need, we’re not trying to be gluttonous or anything.”

Even food banks that rely less on federal funding are worried about what comes next if the emergency food assistance program is reduced or altered in a significant way.
“There’s not an option B,” said Brian McManus, the chief operations officer of the Food Bank of Central New York.
Louisiana, one of the states most reliant on SNAP, stands to be among the places hardest hit by further cuts.
“It’s unfortunate that in a time where the social safety nets are being cut, that our resources are also being cut,” said Wright-Velez.
If people haven’t experienced food insecurity, or don’t know someone who has, they might forget something important, she said:
“Those are real people on the other end of those cuts.”
In all, the USDA records indicate that food banks were expecting more than 27 million pounds of chicken, 2 million gallons of milk, 10 million pounds of dried fruit and 67 million eggs that never arrived. Food banks had planned to schedule more deliveries in the coming months. Those orders are not reflected in this data.

The suit alleges that the state discriminated against Bethany Christian for their policy of hiring only employees who align with the group’s “statement of faith,” by not renewing a contract for refugee resettlement funding, which is managed by the Office of Global Michigan, or OGM. 
The case, filed in federal court in the Western District of Michigan, has now stretched over a year since it was first filed in September 2024. In a stipulated preliminary injunction granted soon after, the office agreed to continue two of Bethany’s three contracts for their final year — a value of $1,000,000.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bethany Christian’s suit comes at a time when conservative and religious advocates are pushing the envelope on legal cases, Michigan State University Law professor Frank Ravitch noted, with a conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court. 
“Prior to 2020, most of these claims wouldn’t have had a leg to stand on,” he said. “But because of recent Supreme Court decisions, there is at least some chance for these arguments to prevail.”
Lawyers for Bethany Christian filed a renewed motion nearly a full year after the initial suit was filed for another preliminary injunction, through which they are asking to have their funding granted to them for the cycle in which it was not renewed — a funding cycle from October 2024 through September 2025.
However, the state argued in a filing at the start of October that the preliminary injunction itself is not valid for a number of reasons — first, that the contracts for which Bethany Christian is seeking renewed funding has already expired in its regular cycle. They also argue that, because it took Bethany Christian nearly a full year to file its renewed motion for the injunctive relief, they have “unreasonably delayed” the case. 
In this response filed, the lawyers for the state and the two officials specifically named — Susan Corbin, director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, and Poppy Sias-Hernandez, director of the Office of Global Michigan — are seeking to have the renewed injunction denied in its entirety.
“OGM cannot revive expired contracts, or change their terms, or cancel other entities’ contracts for services, or simply provide some sort of funding stream to Bethany unattached to a properly awarded contract,” the response states. 
Ravitch noted that the specific ask for injunctive relief might dictate how effective this mootness argument will be in court. 
“A court can’t order the state to create a new contract that it doesn’t have funding for, and it really can’t ask the state to undo the current contract,” he said. “But would it be moot for purposes of something like a declaratory judgment or an injunction that in future bidding situations this can’t be considered?”
The state also refuted the argument that the decision not to renew the contracts with Bethany Christian was religious discrimination — instead stating that it was due to performance and cost considerations. Comparing the performance of Bethany Christian under that $1 million injunction to their prior work, the filing states that under the injunction, “Bethany provided approximately 85.35% less services to refugees in 2024, charging OGM approximately 305.72% more per client served.”
“One of the big questions that seems to be occurring here is, to what extent did the state just deny this under its in order normal bidding process, and it had nothing to do with the anti discrimination rule,” said Ravitch, “and they considered that when they found out about it, but they didn’t end up deciding based on that, in which case Bethany Christian has no leg to stand on.”
Ravitch added that even if Bethany Christian’s version of the facts is found to be more accurate than the state’s, they may still not successfully prove discrimination.
“As long as the state can show that it really did just neutrally apply its anti-discrimination provision and its rule about having someone representative of the religious community from which many of the refugees are from, I think that really hurts Bethany Christian’s argument,” he said. 
They also compare Bethany Christian to Samaritas — another Christian social service agency, which was granted the contracts in the 2024-25 year that Bethany Christian was denied. The filing goes on to say that Samaritas served 1148% more refugees than Bethany Christian in that time frame, while Bethany Christian’s cost per refugee served was 1075% more expensive than Samaritas. 
Ravitch also noted that the case is still in very early stages and has not yet gone through the process of discovery, which can take years — making it unlikely that this case will be wrapped up in any near future.

West Virginia is home to the only two remaining greyhound tracks. (Stock photo/Getty Images)West Virginia is the only state in the country that still allows greyhound racing. 
A new bipartisan bill in Congress would ban greyhound raising nationwide, outlawing the country’s last two remaining greyhound racetracks: the Mardi Gras Casino and Resort in Nitro and the Wheeling Island Hotel Casino and Racetrack in Wheeling.
“Public records reveal that some greyhounds used for live commercial racing suffer serious injuries including broken backs, broken necks, head trauma, paralysis, seizures and electrocution,” the bill said. 
While live racing is declining in popularity, West Virginia’s race tracks are still important economically. Revenue from racetracks help fund public services across the state along with providing jobs in a state where jobs are diminishing. 
“All 55 counties benefit from these casinos,” said Steve Sarras, a greyhound breeder in West Virginia, who said his dogs are well cared for to abide by strict state regulations. “Pensions are funded from these races. Police and fire [services] get a portion of simulcasting wagering.
Sarras said the greyhound racing industry brings thousands of jobs to West Virginia.
The casinos employ nearly 900 people, according to Glen White, director of corporate communications for Delaware North, the company that operates both casinos. The businesses “are positive economic drivers for the state and their regions,” he said, adding that they give back to local charities. 
Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio
Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, represents the area that contains the Wheeling track. He noted that the track provides jobs in dog training, veterinary services and more.
“These are specialized economic and employment opportunities directly tied to the industry which would be gone tomorrow if racing is eliminated,” Fluharty said. “Not to mention, the owners and trainers of these dogs are residents of West Virginia. They are business owners employing people locally.”
Since 2007, state law has said all state-sanctioned casino table games and video lottery machines cannot operate without having horse or dog racing. State-level legislative attempts to undo the mandate have failed.
Casinos make annual video lottery payments to the West Virginia Lottery Commission. The lottery commission transfers some of the money into a purse account for kennel operators that they earn when they win or finish well in races. A separate fund — the West Virginia Thoroughbred Development Fund — supports the state’s horse racing industry.
The legally mandated Greyhound Development Breeding Fund typically pulls between $15 and $17 million annually. The fund, which goes to owners of accredited West Virginia whelped greyhounds, is supposed to promote better breeding and training track facilities.
Carey Theil is executive director of GREY2K USA Worldwide, which works to end greyhound racing around the world. He said that money could be better spent on the state’s roads or public education system. 
“The Legislature, if it wanted to, could absolutely end the live racing mandate and take that $17 million and redirect it anywhere it wants,” Theil said. 
Over the past five years, there has been a steady decline in the number of greyhound racing patrons at both Wheeling Island and Mardi Gras, according to White.
“At Wheeling Island, three kennels have closed in the last two years due to lack of profitability,” he said. 
Delaware North faces fierce competition from other casinos, he said, and focuses on marketing what’s profitable — slots and table games, the restaurants and hotels.
Regardless of what happens with the federal legislation, White said the company has said for years that if state lawmakers passed legislation that allowed it to operate without operating racing, “we would work with the kennel owners to phase out racing.”
Sarras said the decision should be made at the state level — not in Washington, D.C.
“The federal bill doesn’t really concern me,” he said. “I kind of feel like it’s more optics and posturing … Our country has a lot bigger problems to address.”
National organization already working to end greyhound racing in West Virginia 
For Theil, the potential federal ban represents a hope to end greyhound racing in West Virginia after his own efforts to lobby state legislators on the issue haven’t succeeded. His organization’s opposition to racing centers on animal welfare concerns. 
State records indicate that 487 greyhounds were injured at the two tracks in 2024, and it included 162 dogs that suffered broken bones, Theil said. Thirteen greyhounds died.
“These dogs have very short racing careers, and they’re out of the industry by age 3 or 4,” Theil said. Besides training, racing and using the bathroom, he said, “the rest of their life, basically, is spent in a cage.”
There are also concerns about live lure, where rabbits and possums are used in greyhound training.
Sarras emphasized that greyhound racing is an “extremely regulated” industry, and dogs are seen regularly by veterinarians who oversee the greyhounds’ care. Racing isn’t permitted without veterinarians on-site, and Sarras said any injuries to the dogs are treated immediately on-site then sent to a veterinary hospital.
“Those misconceptions of abuse and neglect are just people putting out lies. I always tell people, ‘Believe your eyes and not the lies.’ 
He continued, “These dogs are seen on the regular by veterinarians. There’s no room for abuse and neglect … I can promise you, those dogs are very well taken care of, and they’re happy and healthy and extremely fit.”
For Delaware North, White said, “As long as the company operates racing at Wheeling and Mardi Gras, we will do so to the highest of standards, always keeping the safety and wellbeing of the greyhounds as our top priority.”
Fluharty emphasized that the push to end greyhound racing is not coming from West Virginia residents. 
“It is being pushed by out-of-state propaganda groups like Grey2K,” he said. “They lie about the industry then pack their bags and go home. It’s pathetic.”
“Go visit a kennel. The dogs are very much taken care of when they are racing and afterwards with a 99% adoption rate after their racing career,” Fluharty added.

State lawmakers have tried but failed to end greyhound racing
In West Virginia, dogs have raced at Mardi Gras since 1985, and Wheeling Island transitioned from horse to greyhound racing in 1976.
State lawmakers have in the past considered ending greyhound racing by terminating the West Virginia’s Greyhound Breeding Development Fund. The Legislature passed a bill to end the state dog racing mandate in 2017, but it was vetoed by Gov. Jim Justice. 
In 2020, then Senate President Mitch Carmichael, R-Jackson, prioritized ending greyhound racing in the state, introducing legislation to eliminate the Greyhound Fund and decouple live dog racing from casino operations. He argued that greyhound racing — which he called a dying industry — was harmful for dogs, and that it should not be considered a priority for the state’s funding. 
But lawmakers who represented the Wheeling-area spoke out against it, saying it would devastate the area economically. The measure failed.
Earlier this year, separate bills were introduced by Republicans in the Senate and House of Delegates during the legislative session to end the state mandate for greyhound racing at casinos. 
Tracks wouldn’t have been required “to conduct a minimum number of live racing dates”, the bill said, in order to qualify for a video lottery or racetrack table game licenses.
Once a licensed track wanted to discontinue dog racing, the bills would have required the track to pay $250,000 to $1 million in live racing cessation fee that would go into a special revenue account. 
The funds would have been allocated to facilitate the care, adoption of or placement in no-kill animal shelters of whelped greyhounds that had been running at the tracks, according to the legislation. Sarras told West Virginia Public Broadcasting in 2022 that most of his dogs get adopted. 
Neither bill was taken up for a vote. 
Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, sponsored the House version. 
Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam
“As the delegate who represents the area where Mardi Gras Casino is located, I try to be responsive to requests for bills on this topic and mindful of all the entities involved,” Hess Crouse wrote in an email in June. “As such, what I was hoping to see would have been a step-down approach to the end of greyhound racing to be sure all the animals were properly cared for. I’ve not had any recent conversations about this issue, so I’m not sure what any potential legislation next year may look like.”
Sarras said support for the greyhounding racing industry is still strong in the Statehouse. 
“West Virginia doesn’t have a lot of jobs, so I don’t know why anyone would want to sponsor a job-killer bill that would take out five- to 7,000 jobs,” he said. 
Federal bill seeks to ban ‘cruel,’ ‘unpopular’ greyhound racing
In August, Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif, along with a list of bipartisan co-sponsors, introduced the Greyhound Protection Act, a bill to ban greyhound racing in the United States permanently. The legislation would also prohibit gambling on live and simulcast greyhound races.
“Greyhound racing is a relic of an era long-past in the United States. It is cruel, inhumane, and thoroughly unpopular with the American public — which is why nearly every state in the union has already voted to outlaw it,” Carbajal said in a news release from Grey2K. 
Other states have outlawed greyhound racing, and a handful of states, including Alabama and Iowa, still permit, but have no active tracks. Seven states have passed laws to outlaw remote gambling on greyhound racing since 2022. 
“I think this issue is reaching a tipping point because you’ve seen so many other states act and outlaw greyhound racing,” Theil said. 
Some lawmakers who represent the Wheeling-area still don’t want to see the sport end. Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, has fought to retain greyhound racing. He adopted a fawn brindle greyhound, a retired racing greyhound who is a regular at the state Capitol. Weld has maintained that the greyhounds are treated well after visiting a kennel operated by Sarras.
Greyhound racing is still an economic juggernaut in Wheeling, according to Fluharty, who is an attorney. He is also president of the National Council Of Legislators From Gaming States.
“Total handle in 2023 was $260 million with a large portion from a national simulcast audience, showing the national reach. In 2023, Wheeling’s signal transmission fee totaled $8.87M, reflecting heavy out-of-state demand,” Fluharty said. 
“The federal ban is being pushed by a California representative who probably couldn’t find Wheeling on a map,” he added.
Theresa Bruner, president of the Federation of Humane Organizations of West Virginia, has been fighting for years to end greyhound racing in the state. 
“These dogs belong on couches and not on the race tracks,” she said. “We believe they’re exploited in a cruel way.”
The $15-17 million in required annual subsidy to the greyhound purse funds could be used to fix the state’s other glaring issues, Bruner said, like the financially-troubled Public Employees Insurance Agency. It shouldn’t be propping up the greyhound racing industry, she said. 
“The industry should be left to survive on its own. If it survives, it survives,” she said.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)The news that $130 million in already-committed clean-energy funding for Wisconsin is on the chopping block is not abstract politics. It pulls real tools out of Wisconsin homes, schools, farms, and shop floors — right as our state is building momentum. The result is simple: higher bills, fewer choices, and lost jobs.
In a purple state like ours, climate action has succeeded because it’s kitchen-table common sense. It lowers costs, creates good local jobs, and protects the air and water families depend on. Our playbook is pragmatic — align smart policy with market innovation, center justice, and let businesses, workers, tribes and frontline communities lead together. Clawing back funds mid-stream breaks that compact and injects uncertainty just when we need reliability and speed.
What’s at stake here and now
Across Wisconsin, 82 clean-energy projects are moving forward: EV-charging corridors that support tourism and commerce from Superior to Kenosha; solar on schools and farms that cuts operating costs and keeps dollars local; grid upgrades that reduce outages for households and manufacturers. Clean energy already supports more than 71,000 Wisconsin jobs, with manufacturers, contractors and building trades poised to add tens of thousands more if the rules stay steady.
This is not coastal hype — it’s Menomonee Valley and the Fox Valley. Companies like Ingeteam in Milwaukee build components that power wind and EV projects nationwide. Give our manufacturers clear, predictable rules and Wisconsin will keep making core parts of the transition -— batteries, solar panels, wind components, EV chargers, and smart-grid equipment -— right here at home.
Schools and local governments are also using direct-pay to put solar on rooftops, electrify buses, and cut fuel and maintenance. Green Homeowners United and similar groups are helping thousands of households -— including many lower-income homeowners of color — tap rebates that reduce bills and carbon at the same time. These are the practical tools that stretch tight budgets and improve health outcomes in neighborhoods that have carried the burden the longest.
The real cost of policy whiplash
Rolling back incentives is a hidden tax on working families — up to $400 more a year on energy without the savings tools people are using now. With AI and data centers accelerating demand, the cheapest, fastest reliability gains come from efficiency, storage, and renewables. Cut those tools and we invite more price volatility and more outage risk — exactly what Wisconsin manufacturers, hospitals and farms can’t afford.
The “Big, Broken Bill” passed in Washington goes further, weakening EPA pollution standards and letting big polluters sidestep responsibility. That doesn’t eliminate costs; it shifts them to families in the form of asthma, missed school days and medical bills. It’s not fiscal conservatism to socialize pollution costs while privatizing short-term profits.
And for farmers, whose energy and conservation projects were finally penciling out with IRA tools, canceling support mid-contract leaves family farms holding the bag after planning in good faith. That’s not how you build durable rural economies.
Momentum that continues even if funds are cut
Here’s the other half of the story: Wisconsin’s transition won’t stop because some programs are attacked. Market forces, including  the declining cost of renewables and storage, efficiency that pays for itself and corporate and municipal sustainability commitments, continue to drive projects. Public-private partnerships, rural co-ops, tribal governments, school districts and village halls are working together to reduce risk, share data, and scale what works. That coalition will keep moving.
But let’s be clear: Clawbacks and moving goalposts slow us down and raise costs. They strand planning, freeze hiring and deter investment — especially in manufacturing corridors that depend on multi-year production schedules. If Congress wants to improve programs, fine. Just don’t pull the rug out mid-project.
Purple-state practicality: Results over rhetoric
Wisconsin’s approach is neither red nor blue; it’s results-based:

Lower bills and stronger reliability through weatherization, heat pumps, rooftop and community solar and batteries that keep homes and Main Street businesses running during heat waves and deep freezes.
Good local jobs in design, construction, electrical, HVAC, machining and advanced manufacturing.
Cleaner air from electrified school buses and efficient buildings, health benefits that show up in fewer sick days and lower costs.
Fairness by ensuring benefits land first where burdens have been heaviest.

We’ve also learned to say no when it matters and yes to better options. When a $2 billion methane gas plant was proposed, business and civic leaders asked basic questions: Is this the least-cost, least-risk path for ratepayers? Would it lock us into volatile fuel prices just as renewables, storage, demand response and efficiency are scaling? Pushing for a cleaner, more affordable portfolio wasn’t ideology. It was risk management.
A constructive path forward

Keep the tools that help Wisconsin build here, hire here, and save here. Don’t rip away commitments families, schools, farms and manufacturers are already using.
Provide certainty so manufacturers can invest in people and equipment. Certainty is economic development.
Target affordability and reliability: Expand programs that lower bills, reduce outages, and prioritize investments in communities that have waited the longest for cleaner air and safer housing.
Let locals lead: Support direct-pay and streamlined approvals for schools, municipalities, tribes and rural co-ops to deploy projects faster and cheaper.

Wisconsin has the talent, the supply chains — more than 350 in-state clean-energy companies — and the tradition of stewardship to lead the clean-energy economy. If we stay focused on trust, collaboration and measurable results, Wisconsin’s green momentum will outpace politics.
Don’t make Wisconsinites pay more to get less. Let’s build it here, power it here and prosper here.

(Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court will hear new arguments Wednesday over Louisiana’s congressional maps. State Republican leaders now want to get rid of a majority-Black district they created, and the Supreme Court’s ruling could have national implications.
Attorney General Liz Murrill questions key tenets of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal law that has been amended multiple times over the decades to prohibit racial discrimination in elections. Watching closely are Republicans in other states who have pushed to redraw their congressional districts to improve their odds of holding onto U.S. House seats – and their majority status – in next year’s midterm elections.
In Louisiana v. Callais, justices could set a standard for the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps. 
A group of non-Black Louisiana voters filed the lawsuit after the state legislature, at the direction of Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, approved a U.S. House map in January 2024 with two out of six districts being majority Black. A previous map, which a federal district judge rejected, had just one majority-Black seat in a state where Black residents account for one-third of the population.
The governor and attorney general preferred lawmakers maintain control in drawing new congressional district boundaries after the judge invalidated a previous version and threatened to have her court draw the lines instead.     
The Supreme Court was originally expected to rule on the Callais case earlier this year. But in a rare move, justices punted their decision to their next term. They also posed new questions for parties to answer: Did the legislature’s creation of a second majority-Black district violate the 14th or 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution? 
​The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
Since then, Murrill has gone from supporting the map with two majority-Black districts to questioning the constitutionality of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.
How we got here: Louisiana’s redistricting case puts the Voting Rights Act on trial 

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Murrill argued Section 2, as it has been applied to Louisiana, is unconstitutional. 
“​​Race-based redistricting under Section 2 is principally unconstitutional because it inherently rests on a racial stereotype: that all voters of a particular race must — by virtue of their membership in their racial class — think alike, share the same interests, and prefer the same political candidates,” she wrote. 
To bring a successful case under Section 2, plaintiffs must prove the racial minority in question is politically cohesive.
The Trump administration has filed its own brief echoing Murrill’s arguments. 
Like Murrill, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argues the standard for determining whether a district complies with the Voting Rights Act is flawed and should be altered. The so-called Gingles test, which arose from a 1986 Supreme Court ruling, sets the standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards. 



The Gingles test
Created by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1986 case Thornburg v. Gingles, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions to prove racial vote dilution:

The racial or language minority group “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district”
The minority group is politically cohesive
The majority votes sufficiently as a block to usually defeat the minority’s candidate of choice




The Trump administration also argues that plaintiffs seeking judicial relief from a violation of Section 2 should be required to take state’s political motivations into consideration when offering alternative districts. For example, this could include drawing a district to not just keep an incumbent in their district but to ensure the incumbent’s victory. 
Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive organization that follows redistricting issues throughout the country, said requiring plaintiffs to meet a state’s political goals is among the Trump administration’s boldest proposed modifications to the Section 2 framework. 
“Effectively, this is asking SCOTUS to gut the [Voting Rights Act] without saying you are gutting the [Voting Rights Act],” Li said. 
In addition to the Trump administration, 16 Republican state attorneys general have signed onto briefs in support of Murrill’s arguments in the Callais case. In the filings, Republicans argue in favor of a “colorblind” approach, in which states would not consider race in the redistricting process at all. 
Attorneys with the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund representing Black voters, say the “colorblind” era before approval of the Voting Rights Act was marked by racial discrimination.
“It was an era ‘blind’ to race only in the sense that obvious, widespread discrimination went unaddressed by Congress and courts,” the attorneys wrote in a rebuttal to the Murrill and Sauer briefs. 
Press Robinson, the lead Black voter who sued Louisiana over its original, single-Black district  map, believes the state should still be subject to its Section 2 requirements. Robinson said he hasn’t observed sufficient progress in the 60 years he’s been involved in politics in the state. 
“It’s fairly easy to be arguing that things have changed to the point that there’s no need for special dispensation of Black voters,” Robinson said earlier this month in a news media briefing. “Has Louisiana really changed? I don’t see it. I don’t know what they’re talking about when they say that it has.” 
“Louisiana has only been a full democracy since the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 when federal law finally guaranteed Black communities the right to participate equally in our political process,” ACLU of Louisiana executive director Alanah Odoms said at the same news conference. 
Attorneys for Black voters in the case called Republicans’ stance a “burn-it-all-down approach” and argued Louisiana would prefer no congressional or judicial oversight for its voting processes. 
“Let there be no mistake: That was the situation that prevailed in Louisiana and nationwide for the 100 years before the [Voting Rights Act],” the ACLU and NAACP attorneys wrote. “It was a time when Black voters and other voters of color were systematically excluded from the political process.”

Potential ‘head-spinning reversal’ 
Until the Voting Rights Act was enacted, many promises of Reconstruction era amendments to the Constitution were largely unfulfilled as Black voters were suppressed under racially oppressive Jim Crow laws. 
The Voting Rights Act has been amended five times to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates said federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law. The most notable crack occurred in 2013 when the Supreme Court ruled Section 5 of the act was unconstitutional. The provision required Louisiana and other listed states and local governments to get federal government pre-approval for any redistricting plan or voting law. 
The redistricting cycle based on the 2020 census is the first in which Louisiana was not subject to this preclearance.
Murrill’s defection ended state Republican leaders’ strange bedfellowship with Black voters who challenged the 2022 version of the congressional district map. Both supported the 2024 map, but their alliance came to an end in September when Republicans and groups supporting Black voters filed opposing briefs, teeing up the arguments justices will make Wednesday. 
If the justices side with Louisiana and the Trump administration, it would reverse a precedent the court set just two years ago in in Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required lawmakers there to add a second majority-Black congressional district. 
“If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself,” John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said in a statement. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Special session questions
There is no set date for when justices will rule on Callais, but it is likely to be next year before the end of June. 
In anticipation of the ruling, the Louisiana Legislature is considering a special session in the coming weeks to push back the qualification deadline for next year’s congressional elections. Doing so would give lawmakers enough time next year to adopt a new redistricting plan. 
In August, Gov. Landry directed lawmakers to set aside dates for another redistricting special session, but legislative leaders expressed reluctance to do so before justices made a decision in the Callais case. Depending on the court’s ruling, it’s possible Louisiana’s new U.S. House map could have two, one or even no majority Black districts.
Fair Fight Action, a progressive voting rights organization, predicts that if the Supreme Court sides with conservatives and hollows out Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, states could redraw up to 19 majority Black districts to make them competitive or safe seats for Republicans.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/supremecourtoct92024-1024x7681742939759-1.jpg,,,2025-10-14 06:56:39.862711

To Angela Gifford, executive director of Village of Hope CDA (Coeur d’Alene), those words are more than a rallying cry, or a book title. It’s the foundation of her entire operation.
And it’s a big one.
Idaho foster youth didn’t receive Social Security money they’re entitled to. That will soon change. 

Village of Hope provides support and resources for more than 250 child-foster families, and Gifford’s “village” includes social-worker support, practitioners communications experts and a healthy number of volunteers. The heroes are the foster parents who have big hearts, but not always the capability to host foster kids with a wide range of problems.
“Everyone can do something,” Gifford says. “The kids in foster care in North Idaho are our kids, and they need us to step up – each and every one of us. Not everyone can, or should, be foster parents or work with kids, but everyone can do a little something to support those that are doing it – bringing dinner, tutoring a child, providing diapers, helping prep curriculum, raise awareness donations. There are so many ways to be the village.”
As Gifford says, there’s nothing easy about caring for foster kids – many of whom are victims of abuse. Some troubled kids bounce around to multiple foster homes, going through a string of bad situations. But Gifford’s “village” and social workers do not quit on the kids, or the families.
There are success stories. Meet Katelyn Miller of Rathdrum and Tabitha Norris of Post Falls.
On Christmas Eve of last year, Katelyn took in a newborn boy (Sonny), and it was not for a short-term placement. She’s had experience working with foster children, which inspired her to say “yes” to welcoming Sonny. Katelyn’s 8-year-old son, JJ, was excited about getting a baby brother, but there were many things to work out.
“They said for me to bring a car seat,” she said. “How am I going to get a car seat? And clothing? What kind of formula is he going to be on? What special needs will he have?”
But Katelyn wasn’t doing this alone. The Village of Hope was there to address all those issues and even provide a crib months later.
“The Village of Hope has been amazing,” Katelyn said. “I’m so glad I answered the call on Christmas Eve, and he’s healthy and safe. He lights up my life in ways I never expected.”
Tabitha Norris and her husband, Paul, had a challenge of a different sort. In June, they adopted a 17-year-old boy from southern Idaho who had bounced around foster homes for more than a decade. And Tabitha has plenty of challenges of her own with advanced stages of muscular dystrophy.
“I think that has given me a huge heart for kids who are struggling with trauma and disabilities themselves,” she said. For her son, named Raymond Paul Norris, he now has stability in his life and a mom and dad who care. 
Raising a teenager is not easy in any scenario, but Tabitha says the rewards far outweigh the challenges. Raymond is being home-schooled during his senior year and enjoys basketball, baseball and rock climbing.
“He’s so joyful – so bouncy and fun,” Tabitha says.  “He has changed our lives. He is our hero.”
The Village of Hope has been with Tabitha and Paul through the entire journey, Tabitha says. “They have gone above and beyond, always asking how they can support us.”
Officially, Raymond has “aged out” of the foster-care system, but he’s now working as a junior volunteer with Village of Hope.
Gifford gladly celebrates success stories, but they are not typical in her world. She sees social workers who are overworked, foster parents who do not have enough training and families that are at risk.
“North Idaho has not caught up to offering affordable housing, and families are losing health coverage for their kids,” she says. “These families are at risk and we need to be doing more on the prevention side. We work with families to help kids overcome trauma and set healthy goals, but there are so many other odds that are stacking up against them.”
Gifford is correct. She has a nice “village” in place, but there’s much more that needs to be done.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-14 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi prison chief reopens homicide cases following news investigation,"Jerry Mitchell, Daja E. Henry, The Marshall Project and Mina Corpuz",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/14/mississippi-prison-chief-reopens-homicide-cases-following-news-investigation/,"Nearly 50 prison deaths will be examined, following a joint investigation by multiple Mississippi newsrooms.","The Mississippi Department of Corrections will review more than two dozen unprosecuted homicides inside its prisons, as well as deaths where causes were ruled as “undetermined,” following an investigation by several news sites, including Mississippi Today and  The Marshall Project – Jackson.
“All the deaths that we’ve had since 2015, we’re going back to revisit,” Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain told the reporting team. “There is no statute of limitations, as you know, on homicide.”
Cain’s comments follow an investigation by a team of Mississippi reporters that revealed at least 43 people died by homicide inside Mississippi prisons since 2015. Total murder convictions in those cases? Eight, including two guilty pleas that came after the news stories were published.
The prison homicide investigation involved reporters and editors from The Marshall Project – Jackson, Mississippi Today, The Clarion Ledger, Hattiesburg American and The Mississippi Link. 
A prisoner advocacy group said revisiting past homicides won’t address the key reasons for the deaths in the first place — chronic understaffing of security officers.
Revisiting past homicides is “sort of closing the door after the horse has left the barn,” said David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project. “What the commissioner also needs to do is figure out why this is happening and what to do to stop it.” 
Deaths officially categorized as homicides this year appear to have reached their highest level since 2020, when a gang war pushed that year’s total to at least nine killings.
Forty-one-year-old Aaron Harrison became the sixth person killed in a state prison this year when he died on July 3. A medical examiner later ruled that Harrison, incarcerated at East Mississippi Correctional Facility, was killed by blunt force trauma.  
A nurse practitioner at the prison noticed bruising on Harrison while treating him for a possible drug overdose before he died, according to an incident report obtained by the news reporting team. Court records show that no one has been charged in Harrison’s death, but it is not unusual for homicide investigations to take up to a year.
State Rep. Becky Currie, who chairs the House Corrections Committee, asked a legislative committee last month — as the reporting team was about to publish its investigation — to look into all prison deaths for the past five years. 
The Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review analyzes state agency programs and operations and can issue recommendations.
Even with recent deaths, she’s found that little information is shared with the families, the public and lawmakers when an incarcerated person dies. 
“How can you say you’ll keep people safe if you don’t know what they’re dying of?” Currie asked.
Internal investigations
The corrections department has its own criminal investigations unit and can refer cases to county prosecutors for further action.
Cain said the agency’s Criminal Investigations Division is now examining each death that was not referred to a district attorney’s office. About 25 people work for CID, which has been rebuilt since he took over corrections in 2020, he said.
“We’ve brought a lot more professionalism,” Cain said.
Each prison has an investigator who can respond quickly, and more investigators work out of the central office than before, he said. “That way we can keep the integrity and know what’s going on.”
He compared the investigators’ work on these homicides to working on cold cases. “They’re looking for answers.”
“We’re going back to visit all that to be sure that we haven’t left any stone unturned,” Cain said. “Every crime that is committed in the prison, no matter how small,” will be referred to a county prosecutor. “If he wants to throw it in the trash and not prosecute, that’s up to him.”
In the past decade, prosecutors indicted people in 16 of the 43 homicides, with eight guilty pleas. One case was dropped because the accused person died by suicide before his day in court. Another was dropped in light of evidence that supported the accused person’s claim of self-defense. The remaining six indictments, handed up between 2022 and June 2025, are pending trial. 
The commissioner shared similar comments during a Sept. 24 legislative budget hearing, but lawmakers did not ask him follow-up questions about the investigations. Among those in attendance were House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann.
When reached by the reporting team, the offices of Hosemann and White, along with the state auditor’s office, declined to comment. 
The state Senate Corrections Committee chairman, Sen. Juan Barnett, did not respond to requests for comment about the team’s findings and Cain’s remarks.

In addition to the 43 homicides, another 21 prisoner deaths since 2015 have been ruled “undetermined” by the state medical examiner’s office. That means medical examiners were not able to come to a conclusive answer about how a person died. An undetermined death could be a homicide, suicide, accidental, or a natural death. 
For example, Richard Weems’ 2022 death was ruled undetermined, but medical examiners noted his body showed signs of blunt force trauma. An incarcerated person told the Mississippi Free Press in 2023 that he saw Weems being beaten.
Asked if MDOC planned to review deaths marked as undetermined, Cain replied, “We’re going to look at all of them.”
Cain said prison security has been improved in recent years with more video cameras, six narcotic detection dogs, a drone detecting system and enhanced video on the prisons’ fences to stop drugs from being thrown over or dropped by drones. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the abundance of illegal drugs in MDOC facilities has led to extortion and violence, the department’s 2024 investigation found. 
Staffing shortages lead to violence, advocates say
One of the key problems the news investigation identified is the chronic understaffing that leaves incarcerated people vulnerable to violence. 
Fathi called the staffing levels in Mississippi prisons “a five-alarm emergency.” 
Corrections spokesperson Kate Head said in a statement that staffing “is central to safety and security.” The department continues to address the shortages and strengthen staff accountability, she told the news team.
Since Cain took the helm in 2020, the starting salary for a correctional officer increased by about $13,000, beginning at $40,392. Still, it is hard to hire and retain staff for such dangerous jobs. 
About 30% of the funded corrections officer positions were vacant, Deputy Commissioner Nathan Blevins told lawmakers at the budget hearing in September. 
“No prison can operate safely with that kind of staffing,” Fathi said, “It’s not safe for the incarcerated people, it’s not safe for the staff… it’s not safe for anybody.” 
Homicides in the prisons often happened when corrections officers were not watching.
For instance, Ronnie Graham was killed at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County in 2021, but his battered body was not discovered by a corrections officer for at least five hours. In another case, Jonathan Havard was strangled to death earlier this year at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. However, his body was only discovered after an unidentified parent called to tell the prison officials that he had been killed, according to prison records.
Compounding the staffing problems is the growing prison population. Since December 2021, the number of state prisoners has increased from about 16,800 to 19,300, returning to pre-pandemic levels. Cain said the increase is largely due to high rates of recidivism. 
About 47% of people released in fiscal year 2021 returned to prison within three years, according to state corrections data. 
“If we do a better job of getting them employable, then that’s the whole key to recidivism and not coming back,” Cain said in the legislative hearing. “Recidivism is killing us.”
Cain’s promise of new investigations into unsolved homicides sparked hope for a mother who lost a son. 
Janice Wilkins, the mother of Denorris Howell, who was killed in the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman in 2020, said she is grateful that her son’s case will be reviewed.
“It means a whole lot to me,” she said. “Once they review everything, they should move forward.”

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Republican Party) For the second month in a row, I find myself writing about a sham press conference held under our golden dome in Charleston. 
Last Monday, Republican members of the Legislature gathered with West Virginia Coal Association President Chris Hamilton and Attorney General J.B. McCuskey to heap praise on President Donald Trump’s latest attempts to pretend coal will make a lasting comeback. Recently the administration announced it would open up millions of acres of public lands for coal mining and dedicate over $600 million for coal plant upgrades across the country. 
Too bad last week’s press conference to discuss the Trump proposal was short on actual plans, and too long on falsehoods and misconceptions to convince West Virginia voters that they’re doing something to help the mining industry, coal miners and West Virginia overall. 
Normally I’d use this space to explain why coal can’t revive in the way West Virginia officials want you to think. Lately there has been great local and national reporting about the cost of West Virginia’s reliance on expensive coal fired-power as well as the global rise in renewable energy. This week the New York Times reported that wind and solar produced more power in the world than coal for the first six months of 2025. 
Simply put, our elected officials are trying to score political points by misleading the public about the potential for coal to power West Virginia. Actually, the potential does still exist. But it will be at great expense to all of us who pay electricity bills. Even our utilities, Appalachian Power and Mon Power, don’t see a future in which coal power is king. Also, the $625 million investment they tout won’t go very far. It can cost tens of millions to upgrade aspects of a coal power plant. 
I’d rather spend the bulk of this discussing something McCuskey said that really struck a nerve with me. “And this president, for the first time in a very long time, can look at every single coal miner in the face in this country and say I respect you, I value you, and what you are doing is a patriotic duty that is designed to rebuild this country’s superiority on the world stage,” he said. 
I work on black lung policy in my day job, and I have the privilege of meeting and working with coal miners with black lung and their families. In case you didn’t know, rates of black lung disease are worse than it has been in decades. It’s a terrible, incurable disease, and the people I work with are advocating for stronger protections for the current and future generations of coal miners. 
I don’t agree that this president and the federal or state governments are able to look miners and coal communities in the face and say they value them. If so, why haven’t they passed legislation to raise the monthly black lung stipend for miners who are too sick to work? Just last month, West Virginia Watch published a commentary from the vice president of the Black Lung Association. She wrote about how the One Big Beautiful Bill has a tax break for coal mining that ironically will be worse for black lung disease because it will likely lead to less money going to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.  
Why is the Trump administration not fighting to preserve the silica dust rule that would protect coal miners? Silica is highly toxic and has been killing Appalachian coal miners (and other occupations that are exposed to the dust). The rule is currently on hold due to a lawsuit from the mining industry and the Trump administration hasn’t indicated that it’s interested in strongly defending it. That’s why coal miners and the Black Lung Association are going to rally in Washington D.C. today to demand action. 
Our state lawmakers, governor, attorney general and congressional representatives have all been mostly silent on actually trying to tackle black lung disease, which, again, is at its highest levels in years and it will likely get worse. Every year, the Legislature invites coal miners to come to the capitol for Black Lung Awareness Day. And every year, they fail to pass legislation to improve the state compensation system for miners with black lung. 
So when officials stand in front of the cameras to say they care about coal, I have to ask if they actually care about who is mining it. Even if it turns out that coal “comes back” and we have coal power plants for decades to come, what will they do to actually ensure the health and well-being of the coal miners? Starting with being honest to West Virginians, as well as making commitments to reduce black lung disease and mining accidents is a good start.

Local officials are urging residents to tap into the funds, with just one month left to apply for federal aid. Thousands of Milwaukee County residents were affected by the floods, which blanketed streets and parks in flood water and debris after a record-breaking thousand-year storm. 
“Federal assistance is a crucial resource to help our residents repair their homes, recover from flood damage, and take a major step toward normalcy,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement. “But to unlock this funding you must apply. I know the process can feel overwhelming, representatives from our federal partners are available throughout Milwaukee County at Disaster Recovery Centers and Disaster Survivor Assistance locations to help you every step of the way. With only one month left to apply, I strongly urge everyone affected by the flood to start the application today. Don’t wait until the last minute.”

The deadline to apply for federal aid is Nov. 12, with residents able to apply at DisasterAssistance.gov, or by phone at 800-621-3362. Residents are also encouraged to visit one of the disaster recovery centers at the West Allis Senior Center (7001 W National Ave), or the Milwaukee recovery center at McNair Elementary School (4950 N. 24th St). A recovery center that had been located at the Wauwatosa City Hall closed Friday Oct. 10, after assisting more than 500 residents with Federal Emergency Management Agency applications over its two and a half weeks of operation, according to a press release. 
In the month since federal assistance became available, FEMA has distributed nearly $92 million to flood survivors statewide. Of that, just over $82 million has gone to 15,666 Milwaukee County residents. Additionally, the U.S. Small Business Administration has approved $10.2 million in disaster loans to Milwaukee County homeowners, renters and business owners. 
FEMA has also continued providing flood relief through the government shutdown. A spokesperson from the office of U.S. Rep.  Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) told the Wisconsin Examiner at the onset of the shutdown that FEMA will continue conducting essential duties, including payments to disaster survivors, debris removal, emergency protective measures and salaries for the disaster workforce.

A mailer targeting three justices up for retention pins blame for the map on the state Supreme Court. (US Government)A voting rights watchdog group called on a conservative PAC backed by Republican financier Jeffrey Yass to rescind and apologize for a campaign mailer falsely pinning blame on the state Supreme Court for an unconstitutionally gerrymandered congressional district map.
The Republican-controlled General Assembly’s 2011 congressional redistricting map drew national attention for its oddly shaped districts, including one nicknamed “Goofy kicking Donald Duck” because of its resemblance to the Disney cartoon characters. 
That map is featured on a mailer sent to homes across the commonwealth last month urging voters to “Term limit the liberal Supreme Court,” as Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht run for retention next month.
The nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania was the lead plaintiff in a 2017 lawsuit challenging the legislature’s map. The case ultimately resulted in the Supreme Court ordering the state to use its alternative for the 2018 mid-term elections. 
“We litigated it, and the result was a court ruling that resulted in a map that was more fair, cleaner, more appropriate, more constitutional,” League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania President Susan Gobreski said in a call with reporters Thursday.
Gobreski and others say the mailer is misleading and threatens judicial independence.
“Everyone has the right to an opinion, but no one has the right to lie to voters and call it democracy,” Gobreski said. “They should really pull these mailers and apologize to voters.”
The mailer shows the 2011 map with two of its districts sprawling over multiple counties circled in red. Next to the map is the message “The liberal Supreme Court gerrymandered our congressional districts to help Democrats win.”
In fact, the court first ordered the General Assembly to produce a map that passed constitutional muster without putting partisan interests ahead of neutral lines that avoided splitting counties and municipalities. When the legislature and then-Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, failed to agree on an alternative, the court provided its own.
The GOP challenged the court’s map in federal court but was unsuccessful in overturning it. The redistricting resulted in a net gain of three congressional districts for Democrats, changing the state’s representation in the U.S. House from a 12-6 Republican majority to a 9-9 tie.
With the election three weeks away, the League of Women Voters is urging voters to seek trustworthy information about the justices and the election from nonpartisan organizations like itself and the Pennsylvania Bar Association, which has an independent commission that evaluates every candidate for statewide judicial office. It has rated all three “recommended for retention.”
Dickinson College President John E. Jones III, who is a retired U.S. district judge, said judicial retention elections, which coincide with municipal elections, generally have low voter turnout and those who vote often know little about the judges or their records. 
Jones noted the only time a Pennsylvania justice has lost a retention vote was 2005, when voters responded to the midnight pay raise that the General Assembly approved earlier that year by broadly voting against incumbents. Justice Russel Nigro was not retained by a narrow margin, while Justice Sandra Schultz Newman was retained with 54% of the vote. Retention vote margins are typically in the range of 60% to 75%. 
“It had nothing to do with Justice Nigro’s bona fides as a justice, but rather the prevailing political climate,” Jones told the Capital-Star. “I’m concerned that if the three justices who are subject to the retention votes are simply unelected because of their party affiliations, then we’ve missed the point of what the retention elections are supposed to be.”
Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht were elected as Democrats in 2015, defeating three Republican nominees in the only election where three new justices have been elected in the court’s more-than-300-year history. A defeat in this year’s retention election would result in competitive elections in 2027 and a chance to swing the court’s ideological balance in favor of conservatives.
The mailer was paid for by Commonwealth Leaders Fund, a political action committee whose treasurer Matthew Brouilette is linked with two other groups spending money to influence the Supreme Court election. 
Yass, the founder of trading firm Susquehanna International Group, contributed $1.25 million to his pro-school choice Students First PAC this year, according to campaign finance reports. Last year Yass donated $16 million to the PAC, chaired by SIG Counsel Geoff Bushko. 
This year and last, most of the money flowed to Brouilette’s PAC, Commonwealth Children’s Choice Fund. The Children’s Choice Fund in 2024 gave nearly $12 million to Commonwealth Leaders Fund, much of which was spent during the presidential election, according to campaign finance records.
Commonwealth Leaders Fund has spent about $185,000 on expenses labeled “direct mail” or “mailing” so far this year, according to campaign finance reports, the most recent of which was due Sept. 15. Reports for the other groups, Commonwealth Partners and Citizens for Term Limits, whose names appear on ads and mailers about the retention election, were not available online.
A spokesperson for Susquehanna International Group who returned a call seeking comment from Yass said he had no comment. Commonwealth Partners, which administers the PACs, did not respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, spending in Supreme Court elections in Pennsylvania and elsewhere have set new records year upon year. Candidates in the 2015 election where Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht were elected spent $15.8 million. That was surpassed in 2023 when now-Justice Daniel McCaffery and his Republican opponent spent more than $19.5 million, which included nearly $4.5 million from Yass’ PAC. 
The same year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court race shattered the national record with more than $100 million in spending, including nearly $30 million from Elon Musk, the world’s richest man..  
The heavy political spending in Pennsylvania’s judicial elections perverts the intent of the retention process, said Deborah Gross, executive director of Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, a nonprofit that advocates for court access.
Pennsylvania adopted its system of electing jurists and retaining them for subsequent terms after the 1967 constitutional convention, which modernized the commonwealth’s foundational document. It followed decades of criticism over the process of electing judges and justices, which had been in place since 1850.
The new system would combine direct election by the people with a nonpartisan, non-competitive re-election that spared incumbent judges the rigors of a campaign while allowing the public to decide on judges’ fitness to continue serving based on their prior term.
But Gross said the system wasn’t intended to take the judges’ interpretation of law into account.
“If someone is not doing their job properly, if they’re not showing up for court, if they’re doing bad acts, if they have judicial conduct issues. Those are reasons why someone should not be retained,” Gross said. “Judges are doing their jobs when they’re interpreting the law.”
Jones, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, presided over landmark cases challenging the teaching of “intelligent design” in public schools and Pennsylvania’s ban on same-sex marriage. Jones found both to be unconstitutional.
“It is problematic, I think, for jurists to be judged on one or two cases,” he said, adding that most voters don’t have the time or resources to consider the justices’ records in total. “They’re apt to potentially make a reactionary vote. It’s fueled by perhaps a misleading ad and just a lack of knowledge about the justices.”
The League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania is considering how to respond to the Commonwealth Leaders Fund mailing, Executive Director Amy Widestrom said, noting that some voters have already received mail ballots and are making their decisions.
In addition to the bar association’s ratings, the league and Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts hosted a “fireside chat” with the three justices that is available to view on YouTube. The league has also worked to aggregate trusted information about the judicial election.
“There’s a lot of really good nonpartisan information out there, and I know it’s hard to find, so we’re trying to consolidate it all into our website, and our partners are doing the same,” Widestrom said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/lossless-page1-1200px-Pennsylvania_Congressional_Districts_113th_Congress.tif-1024x681.png,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)As the federal government entered a shutdown on Oct. 1, 2025, competing narratives quickly emerged about the cause.
Some Republican lawmakers objected to Democrats’ push to include an extension of the expanded Affordable Care Act premium subsidies in a short-term funding bill and cited concerns about long-term spending. Democratic leaders countered that the subsidies are not a new demand but rather the continuation of a program that has helped keep record numbers of Americans insured since the pandemic – and therefore that the issue could not be delayed.
The result is a standoff that blends fiscal and policy disagreements – a hallmark of contemporary budget politics.
As experts in health law, we see this issue as simple but consequential from a legal standpoint. Congress authorized the enhanced subsidies in 2021, originally to cushion the economic fallout from COVID-19 for families, and extended them through 2025 in the Inflation Reduction Act.
Without new legislation, the subsidies revert to pre-2021 levels on Jan. 1, 2026 – which would lead to a jump in the cost of health insurance and would make coverage unaffordable for millions of Americans.
 Enhanced subsidies explained

Most Americans under age 65 get insurance through their employers, which the federal government subsidizes by making it tax-free. Medicare, the program for older Americans, and Medicaid, the program that mainly serves low-income Americans, are heavily supported by subsidies too.
But as of 2025, about 1 in 6 people under age 65 do not have access to this coverage, including many small-business owners and tradespeople, as well as part-time workers and those in the gig economy. For them, unsubsidized health insurance can be prohibitively expensive.
To address this affordability problem, the ACA provided for households earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level to receive subsidies for purchasing policies on the ACA marketplace, effectively lowering premiums. The original law limited subsidies only to those making under 400% of the federal poverty level, which is, for a family of four in 2025, around US$128,000 per year. A family making $129,000 a year, however, would have to pay full price.
The American Rescue Plan temporarily made two major changes in 2021:

It removed the 400%-of-poverty eligibility ceiling, extending help to many middle-income families.
It capped the maximum household contribution at 8.5% of income for everyone, ensuring affordability regardless of income.

If these reforms expire in 2026, the Internal Revenue Service must revert to the older, less generous formula.
 What the subsidies accomplished

The enhanced subsidies drove ACA marketplace participation to historic highs – more than 24 million people selected plans for 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020. The Department of Health and Human Services found disproportionate enrollment gains among Black and Latino Americans, helping to reduce racial disparities in coverage.
For many low-income enrollees, mid-level plans – called silver plans in the ACA marketplace – effectively became free. Middle-income families who previously earned just above the cutoff gained meaningful relief, sometimes saving thousands of dollars a year.
 What happens if subsidies expire?

Analysts broadly agree that returning to the pre-2021 rules would mean large cost increases and coverage losses. On average, the premiums that Americans will pay for ACA marketplace plans would more than double. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that average annual out-of-pocket premiums for an individual would jump from about $888 in 2025 to $1,900 in 2026.
With these increases, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance coverage. The Urban Institute, a think tank, projects that 7.3 million fewer people would receive subsidized marketplace coverage and 4.8 million more would become uninsured.
This is highly consequential, as research shows that insurance coverage saves lives by ensuring access to care. Knocking nearly 5 million people off insurance may cause as many as 500 additional deaths per year.
Losses would disproportionately impact low- and middle-income families. Free premium plans would disappear. Those making below 250% of the federal poverty level could see their net premiums rise more than fourfold, while those between 250% and 400% would see their premiums double. What’s more, rural Americans, already under pressure from the state of the economy, face higher risks.

 The fiscal and policy trade-offs

On the flip side, making the enhanced credits permanent would add about US$350 billion to federal deficits between 2026 and 2035, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates. Proponents argue that the cost is justified by reduced medical debt, fewer uninsured, greater household stability and ultimately saving lives. Short-term savings from cutting the subsidies would also lead to higher health care costs, longer-term. But critics worry it’s a broad and expensive way to support affordability, benefiting some higher-income households that could otherwise afford coverage, even though it would cost more than 8.5% of their income.
Another concern is how the subsidies affect price competition. Under the ACA, the government pays most of the difference between what a household is expected to contribute and the actual cost of a standard benchmark plan. That means if health insurance companies raise their premiums, those who receive subsidies don’t feel the effect of the premium increases, because the federal subsidy simply grows to cover it. That means companies have fewer reasons to compete on price.
 Legal and administrative constraints

Because the subsidies are written into the tax code, only Congress can extend them or make them permanent. The question of whether to renew them was already debated strenuously when Congress passed the big tax and spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. By omitting the subsidies, the bill effectively raised health care costs for millions of middle-income Americans. States that run their own marketplaces may add some aid, but few can match the scale of federal support.
Administrative timing matters too. The IRS, health insurers and the online marketplace all need to know how the subsidy amounts will be calculated – in other words, which income limits and premium caps Congress wants to use. These figures determine how much financial help people get when they sign up for coverage. Late or temporary fixes can create confusion for both consumers and administrators.
 Options before Congress

Lawmakers have several options, each with different trade-offs.
A permanent extension would provide stability for consumers and insurers – but at the cost of higher long-term federal spending. A short-term renewal of one to four years could soften the immediate jump in premiums while giving Congress time to reassess the policy, but it would continue the cycle of temporary fixes.
Alternatively, a targeted approach might preserve the larger subsidies for lower-income households but gradually reduce assistance for higher earners so that they aren’t guaranteed a cap of 8.5% of their income for insurance. This would make the policy more fiscally restrained but less universal.
Some legislators have also proposed offsetting the cost of ACA subsidies by pairing an extension with savings elsewhere in the health system. Those savings could come from trimming what the government pays insurers to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs or by reducing Medicare payments to doctors.
Each of these options reflects a different balance among affordability, fiscal responsibility and administrative simplicity. Together, they highlight how difficult it is to design a policy that meets all three goals at once.
 A structural challenge

The problem isn’t just political – it’s built into how time-limited programs like the enhanced ACA subsidies are designed. The subsidies have always reflected partisan divides, but their temporary nature makes those divides even sharper. Lawmakers limited them to a few years to keep costs down, but that choice now means Congress has to reopen the same debate every year.
When deadlines for renewing programs collide with larger funding fights, important benefits can lapse, not because lawmakers chose to end them but because the fights over broader spending leave little room for resolution.
In the end, it’s up to Congress to decide not only whether these subsidies continue, but whether big social policies like this should be settled through last-minute budget showdowns. For now, getting the government running and keeping health insurance affordable are part of the same fight.

I am a single mom — making ends meet often means adding a gig to your income.
I thought driving full time for a rideshare app might be the safety net I needed. It wasn’t about having what I needed, it was about having an option to make cash. Any time I turned to driving it was to supplement or be my full-time income because I needed immediate cash.
The advertisements on social media about the flexible hours, potential upside, and being your own boss are not close to the reality of the circumstances of your everyday rideshare driver. What I experienced was reflected in a later report that came out on driver and gig experience by Jobs with Justice. It narrated exactly what I had experienced — often driving around the city looking for a ride to just pay for the gas without rides that help pay for that gas.
Some days I drove for 14 hours straight without making minimum wage when I had to turn around and pay for car maintenance. As the report indicated, our reported mileage, income, hours and unpaid time add up, and across all three gig platforms it studies — Uber, Lyft and Doordash — it found that drivers were making around $5.49 an hour.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Read that again. Drivers are making on average $5.49 an hour.
This means that Uber and Lyft have created a second class of workers — unable to reach benefits, or any rights that workers do in other sectors, since rideshare companies call themselves “non-employers,” evading any responsibility over the people who work for them. There is no employer liability. Drivers are on their own, and making less than minimum wage. Minimum wage in Denver in 2025 is $18.81 per hour for non-tipped employees and $15.79 per hour for tipped employees. These corporate giants are making people work for one-third of the minimum wage in metro Denver. Seems like a crime, right?
Imagine chasing cash with your car when you have to worry about the constant fear that one complaint or algorithm change would end your income immediately.
I drove across Interstate 25 and even Lyfted across Summit County multiple times, during three winters, which left a tremendous cost on my car. When I had to replace my brakes, I was out of that income again.
One Friday evening I remember parking near Union Station in downtown Denver, waiting for a ping by my old office after being laid off. The first two hours of driving were filled with short trips: a half-mile drop, a quick run across the block, a drunk man who verbally accosted me, someone who puked in my back seat, each ride earning me around $6 or $7. Then a longer ride popped up, about 16 miles across town I’d get $13 for. Add in the mileage, gas and wear on my car, and that longer ride was hardly worth the time. By the end of six hours on the road, I had about $60 before expenses, well under minimum wage before subtracting gas, insurance, maintenance, and self-employment taxes.
Many days the promise of “flexibility” felt more like economic fragility.
National industry data shows that gig drivers’ earnings have declined in recent years, even as hours on the road have increased. In one analysis, drivers saw a 3% drop in average weekly earnings while logging more hours, a lose-lose equation. Federal regulators have even taken action against gig companies for advertising exaggerated earnings potential, underscoring what most drivers already know: The advertised $25 or $30 an hour is far from what most of us see after expenses.
Do the math. Suppose you gross $25 an hour on the app during a “busy” period. Subtract platform fees, gas, insurance, car depreciation and taxes. Then factor in the unpaid hours spent waiting for rides. That $25 shrinks fast, often into single digits an hour.
Denver is not unique. This is the reality of gig work across the state and the country. But here in Colorado, rideshare platforms are essential parts of our transportation system. Students, seniors and late-night workers depend on them. That dependence makes it easy to forget that behind every ride is a driver absorbing nearly all the risk with no protections from any employer, because Uber and Lyft are not considered employers and thus are unable to offer worker protections that those workers would otherwise have if they were not considered independent contractors.
Colorado has the opportunity to lead for our gig workers who are marginalized by these corporate giants and their anti-worker policies. Transparent earnings, caps on how much companies can take from a driver for a ride, portable benefits, better deactivation rules and support for cooperative models are all areas we know drivers are concerned with.
I eventually left driving full time. The physical and emotional toll was too high and I had to replace my brakes — a $700 job that can’t be done with my income as a driver. I am one of 248,378 gig workers who have been broadly defined as independent contractors and make up 12% of Colorado’s workforce. This workforce (potentially over 1 in 10 Colordans) does not have access to basic worker rights, let alone minimum wage.
It’s time that changes.

Mark Warner (left) and Tim Kaine of Virginia are co-sponsoring legislation to protect federal workers from evictions and loan defaults during the shutdown. (Official U.S. Senate photo by Rosa Pineda)As the federal government shutdown stretches into its third week, Virginia’s U.S. senators are backing a bid to shield federal workers and contractors from the fallout. Last week, Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine joined 16 other Senate Democrats in introducing the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act, a bill intended to protect federal employees, federal contractor staff and their families from evictions, foreclosures, repossessions and defaults during a funding lapse.
The legislation would halt evictions or foreclosures, stop repossession of vehicles or other property, prevent negative credit impacts, pause student loan default consequences, and let workers stay current on bills and insurance premiums — protections that would remain in place for the duration of a shutdown plus 30 days afterward.
“Through no fault of their own, hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants in Virginia have been furloughed or are currently working without pay. That creates real financial strain for families trying to keep up with mortgages, student loans, and other bills,” Warner said in a statement. “This legislation will help ensure federal workers and contractors aren’t forced to bear the cost of a shutdown they didn’t cause.” 
Kaine pressed a similar point: “During a government shutdown, federal employees and contractors are forced to work without pay, leaving many trying to figure out how they’re going to pay their rent, mortgage, car payment, or other bills. That’s why I’m introducing this legislation to help protect these federal workers and contractors from losing their home or defaulting on payments during a shutdown.”
The move comes as tens of thousands of federal workers and contractor employees across Virginia — and nationwide — navigate a precarious financial situation. In Richmond alone, more than 90 employees at the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) were furloughed without back pay when the federal shutdown halted Health and Human Services funding for nonessential operations.
Across Northern Virginia, which includes many suburbs home to federal workers, unemployment rates have risen as layoffs ripple through the region. Virginia’s unemployment rate has already ticked upward this year — reaching 3.6% in July — and in June it was the only state to record a monthly increase, according to data from Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
A Brookings summary of the DMV Monitor analysis shows that unemployment increases in the region have been particularly pronounced in the suburbs — Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties are flagged as seeing the largest rises. 
 In Hampton Roads, a region especially dependent on federal and military presence, local officials have warned of reduced consumer spending and economic drag on restaurants, retailers and other businesses.
Virginia is particularly vulnerable: More than 147,000 civilian federal employees live in the state, and Northern Virginia is among the areas feeling the stiffest economic aftershocks of federal downsizing.
In Fairfax County alone, roughly 80,000 federal workers live in the area, and county officials have been preparing emergency resources to help families with food, rent and utilities.
The Senate legislation is backed by major labor groups, including the National Treasury Employees Union, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association, UNITE HERE and others. 
Doreen Greenwald, national president of NTEU, framed the bill as a safeguard for civil servants who otherwise carry the burden of a political impasse.
“Federal employees have student loans, mortgages, car payments, and other financial commitments just like every other American. Those obligations don’t go away during a shutdown,” Greenwald said in a statement. 
“If passed, the Federal Employee Civil Relief Act will help civil servants across the nation have peace of mind when navigating the uncertainty posed when the government shuts down and their financial security is jeopardized. Federal employees serve the public daily. This legislation honors their service and ensures they aren’t penalized when circumstances arise that are no fault of their own.” 
AFGE President Everett Kelley added that “No public servant should be at risk of eviction, repossession, or losing health insurance simply because they are working without pay or furloughed.”
The shutdown began Oct. 1, after Congress failed to pass new appropriations, triggering the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers and forcing many others to continue working without pay.
In an unprecedented step, the White House has also initiated mass layoffs — so-called reductions in force (RIFs) — rather than simply furloughing employees. That shift raises further risk for households that may lose employment entirely rather than simply enduring a pay interruption.
Amid the crisis, Virginia Democratic elected officials have responded sharply to the administration’s handling. 
Abigail Spanberger, the party’s nominee for governor, blasted mass firings of Virginia federal workers, saying she’s hearing from families “who are hurting because of the Trump Administration’s attacks on Virginia’s economy and workforce.” 
She criticized Republican leadership for refusing to oppose what she called reckless firings and pledged she would “never be afraid to stand up to the President when he attacks Virginians’ jobs.” 
Similarly, Democratic nominee for attorney general Jay Jones called the firings “reckless” and said he would act to stop any illegal terminations, accusing his opponent Jason Miyares of failing to stand up to Trump. 
At the legislative level, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, assailed Republicans for “hurt(ing) Virginia families by laying off workers on a Friday afternoon,” warning that “using people’s livelihoods as a partisan political bargaining chip is a cruel act.”
The Senate proposal is not the only effort underway. Some lawmakers have proposed paying federal employees working through the shutdown immediately, even while appropriations remain unresolved.
But back pay is now under renewed scrutiny. A White House Office of Management and Budget memo contends that the 2019 Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) does not automatically guarantee back pay after a shutdown unless Congress explicitly provides funds. Democrats strongly dispute that interpretation, arguing that previous practice and statutory purpose support retroactivity.
In the Senate, Warner and Kaine are banking on bipartisan concern for public servants to propel the civil relief act forward. Their effort is spearheaded by Sens. Brian Schatz, D-HI, and other Democrats. If passed, it would give affected workers a 30-day buffer following a shutdown to get back on track with bills and housing stability.
Whether the approach will gain traction in the divided Congress is uncertain — especially given the sharp standoff over core budget priorities.

Glenn Youngkin views data center infrastructure designed by Hyper. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)As data centers continue to sprawl across Virginia — with hundreds already built and many more planned nationwide — the demand for the equipment powering these massive digital hubs is surging. Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday touted a Henrico company that can rapidly deploy hyperscale, AI, and colocation data center components.
Hyper, the Henrico-based manufacturer, cut the ribbon on its new headquarters, where engineers design electrical power distribution and cooling systems that regulate temperature and supply electricity to the racks housing the critical servers. 
The company’s technology uses a smaller, more efficient design than traditional cooling infrastructure and is engineered  to to minimize power loss throughout a data center’s system. It also touts its extensive U.S. manufacturing footprint as a way to ease supply chain challenges.
“(We) build it with the highest efficiencies of steel, copper, aluminum, so that there’s less loss through their distribution system, allowing more of the energy to go to the actual chips that do the work,” said Dennis Strieter, co-founder of Hyper. “Cooling’s the same way. We want to match the cooling with the actual output of the heat of the chip and we want those tied together through sensors so that we’re not over cooling the space and we’re not under cooling the space.”
Hyper’s model is to manufacture parts in 18 states across the country, ensuring components reach data centers quickly as construction booms nationwide. The company currently employs 40 people at its Henrico headquarters.
“We spend a lot of time focusing on on-time delivery, because right now, in the market, that’s what’s holding everybody up — they’re not getting the equipment to open the buildings on the day they promised their customer,” Strieter said. ”We’ve had to rethink the way that we designed products.”.
Data centers consume vast amounts of energy to cool the rows of server racks inside their buildings. While Hyper’s components are smaller and more efficient, it’s up to the data centers themselves to determine how to further reduce energy use as rack technology evolves.  
With Dominion Energy currently awaiting State Corporation Commission approval for a new rate class for data centers, lawmakers are examining how to expand Virginia’s energy capacity to sustain the fast-growing industry.
“We’ve got a lot of work to do on the policy front to make sure that data centers are able to take on their own power generation and are willing and able to take on the added cost of the infrastructure necessary for the big builds,” Youngkin said Monday. “We want more data centers here. It’s a big driver for our economic future and for our national security.”
On the energy side, some officials worry that not all proposed data centers will ultimately be built, potentially leaving the state with excess energy projects already in the pipeline. 
When asked whether there’s a possibility of an “AI bubble,” the governor said he remains encouraged by the strong demand for new data centers amid the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence across industries. He added that companies like Hyper will continue to play a vital role for decades to come.
“Huge supply with no demand, that’s what causes a crash,” Youngkin said “And in this case, there is giant demand, giant growth, and it’s being met with, of course, investment.”

With demonstrations planned Saturday in the morning and afternoon, some might even consider joining in more than one, Robert Vitello, treasurer of the Newport Democratic City Committee, said. 
The Newport Democratic committee is arranging bus transportation from Aquidneck Island to Providence for the rally near the State House taking place from 1 to 3 p.m. 
Vitello told Rhode Island Current Monday that the group had filled at least one bus so far. Limited free tickets for a seat were available, but tickets can be reserved by donation through the end of Tuesday. 
“Many others are attending local events that are happening in the morning in Portsmouth, North Kingstown and other other towns, so people can attend both if they’re interested,” Vitello said via text message. 
Vitello participates in the committee’s weekly demonstrations near the Pell Bridge, to signal dissatisfaction with Trump’s administration. The bridge coalition gathers on Wednesdays and averages between 25 and 50 people, Vitello said.  
“The most amazing thing is the response from passing motorists, waving, giving us a thumbs up and honking their horns,” Vitello said. “We would be fooling ourselves if we thought that the constant barrage from the Trump White House isn’t taking [a] toll, but every day we get new supporters saying enough is enough.” 
A Sept. 18 press release from the national No Kings coalition organizing the protests describes the rallies as “a nationwide mobilization uniting millions of Americans in nonviolent protest against President Trump’s authoritarian actions and power grabs.”
Saturday’s protests were in the planning stages before the federal government entered a shutdown on Oct. 1, but the shutdown seems to have only added more fuel to organizers’ critiques of the Trump administration.  
National organizers bill the rallies as having “a shared commitment to nonviolent protest and community safety.” As of Monday, there were about 2,500 protests planned across the U.S. 
“I cannot sit by and watch what is happening to our country, from sending in the National Guard to our American cities to unleashing masked ICE agents who terrorize our neighborhoods, to using our U.S. Justice department to go after political adversaries,” Vitello said. “If you call these tactics for what they are, it is fascism, which is un-American.”
Groups involved in organizing the protests nationally include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Federation of Teachers, Common Defense, 50501, Human Rights Campaign and Indivisible. Home of the Brave, one of the groups involved in backing the No Kings events, launched a $1 million ad campaign in local and national newspapers to promote Saturday’s rallies, the Huffington Post reported Monday.
U.S House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the protests in an Oct. 10 interview on Fox News.
“The theory we have right now, they have a ‘Hate America’ rally that’s scheduled for Oct. 18 on the National Mall,” Johnson said of one of the larger No Kings protests planned in Washington, D.C. “It’s all the pro-Hamas wing and the Antifa people, they’re all coming out. Some of the House Democrats are selling T-shirts for the event. And it’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally because they can’t face their rabid base.”
The national No Kings coalition responded to Johnson in a statement.
“Speaker Johnson is running out of excuses for keeping the government shut down. Instead of reopening the government, preserving affordable healthcare, or lowering costs for working families, he’s attacking millions of Americans who are peacefully coming together to say that America belongs to its people, not to kings.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
The ongoing federal shutdown has eclipsed the final stretch of negotiations on an updated agreement to guide restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, leaving partner states to contemplate a less ambitious pact with scaled-back targets and modest cleanup goals.
Nearly all normally participating federal agencies have been absent from these deliberations since the Oct. 1 shutdown. The Chesapeake Bay Program’s management board met Thursday without that expertise to hammer out a proposal aimed at closing gaps identified by the public after a draft agreement was announced in July.
That draft agreement had drawn the ire of scientists, advocates and citizen groups for weakening legal accountability under the federal Clean Water Act and diluting the enforcement of the bay’s longstanding pollution limits, known as the Total Maximum Daily Load, or TMDL.
The last bay agreement was struck in 2014 by the six partner states—Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York and West Virginia—along with the District of Columbia, the federal government as represented by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and the Chesapeake Bay Commission.
 Scaled-back framework sparks concern

The new framework proposed in July cut the previous agreement’s 10 goals to four and 31 outcomes to 21. As Inside Climate News reported earlier, pollution targets were left blank, deadlines were pushed back as far as 2040 and oversight timelines were replaced with undefined “X-year” review periods. Several restoration goals were scaled back without explanation.
All that happened before the federal shutdown. But the impact of now largely shuttered agencies was visible during the meeting Thursday, with key federal staff absent and progress on the new bay agreement in question, people familiar with the negotiations told Inside Climate News.
Among the agencies whose participation was cut short by the shutdown are the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service.
Only the EPA was present. The agency acted on behalf of the federal government, but several attendees told Inside Climate News that they felt the lack of the scientific and technical expertise the missing agencies would typically provide in shaping restoration targets.
A vote on the proposed target for waterbird conservation went forward without the input of the Fish and Wildlife Service, while other issues requiring input from the Department of Defense and Army Corps of Engineers were deferred, attendees told Inside Climate News. The EPA cast interim votes representing the federal government, but there was no way to know whether the outcomes would have been different if all partners were at the table.
“We won’t know until the shutdown ends whether decisions taken in their absence align with how all federal agencies would have voted,” Keisha Sedlacek, senior policy director at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in an email. “We do know that Fish and Wildlife Service would have voted in favor of having waterbirds in the agreement, which EPA voted to remove.”
That target, which refers to tracking and protecting bird populations that rely on the Bay’s tidal and non-tidal wetlands, squeaked in with a 5-4 vote.
Gregg Bortz, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, acknowledged that “the inability to communicate with many federal agencies as we reach the end of the revision process is less than ideal.”
But he said in a statement that the federal shutdown has caused limited disruption so far because “the vast majority of the progress and discussions, and virtually all of the technical input, occurred prior to the shutdown.”
 Fear, funding cuts and fading ambition

Also clouding the negotiations were concerns over setting restoration targets that may prove difficult to meet if the Trump administration keeps cutting funding and states’ budgetary constraints persist. Draft revisions on Thursday included lower or unchanged goals for fish passage, wetlands, protected lands and public access, marking a retreat from the previous decade’s progress, several attendees told Inside Climate News.
As the session concluded, some attendees worried that even EPA’s participation could lapse if the shutdown continues, potentially delaying final adoption of the new bay agreement beyond the Oct. 28 target. If the proposal isn’t hammered out soon, the final agreement could get pushed to January, under new executive council leadership.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, said the shutdown and uncertainty surrounding federal funding have produced a cautious, scaled-back bay agreement.
“It seems like a big part of what’s driving some of the decisions in this agreement is fear,” she said. “There’s a fear of not achieving the targets that they set … and that’s reflected in what we’re seeing over the course of several outcomes and targets in the agreement.”
She pointed to wetlands as an example. The proposed target of 3,000 tidal and 3,000 nontidal acres falls below what scientists recommended. She added that while she was glad the waterbird target narrowly survived, “it was disappointing that it came down to such a close vote.”
If the agencies don’t return soon, Reilly warned, some jurisdictions may not feel comfortable moving forward on the agreement.
Sedlacek, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation senior policy director, said it remains unclear how deeply the shutdown will affect the agreement process. “For now,” she said in an email, “the restoration partners remain on track to have a final revised Bay Agreement ready for the Executive Council to approve on December 2. We should know better whether they can finish on time by … October 28.”
She said that while the management board’s latest language on protected lands and wetlands is “stronger than what was in the initial draft,” those goals “still need to be strengthened.”
Jon Mueller, former vice president for litigation at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the absence of key scientific agencies could weaken the integrity and ambition of the agreement.
“My understanding is that some states and, in some cases, EPA, are suggesting the elimination of some of the non-nutrient targets,” he said, referring to goals not directly relevant to nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment reduction, such as outcomes for wetlands and fish. “However, federal agencies like NOAA have federal protection and scientific monitoring obligations and have, in the past, expressed interest in maintaining these targets. … Without their presence, their advocacy for maintaining robust targets will be lost.”
Mueller added that enforcement and permitting oversight, already weakened in recent years, could suffer further under the shutdown. “EPA Region II and III play a significant role in monitoring Clean Water Act point source permitting and enforcement within the bay watershed,” he said. “Even without the shutdown we have seen federal enforcement reduced either because of firings at EPA and DOJ [the Department of Justice] or because those are no longer priorities.”
He added: “Without federal oversight, states with delegated permitting authority—Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware — are free to operate on their own.”
Bortz, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources spokesman, said the state views the current draft as an important update that reflects scientific progress since the last agreement, even if compromises were inevitable.
“Maryland did not get everything it sought in the current draft of the revised agreement, but neither did any other partner,” Bortz said. “As with any partnership, reasonable compromise is to be expected between six states, the District of Columbia, the federal government, and the Chesapeake Bay Commission working to meet a common goal.”
Asked about the impact of the shutdown to the process, a spokesperson for EPA emailed a brief statement: “EPA always spends according to the law. Congressional Democrats have chosen to shut down the government. If they want to re-open the government, they can choose to do so at any time.”",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2166526241-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)If voters approve Question 2 on the November ballot, Maine would end up with two laws on the books that would make it possible to remove firearms from someone considered to be dangerous. 
While twenty-one states, including four in New England, have what is known as a red flag law, Maine is the only one that takes a different approach with its so-called yellow flag law. Both are forms of extreme risk protection orders, which are used to temporarily confiscate firearms from someone who poses a risk of danger to themselves or others. 
In November, Maine voters will be asked if they want the state to adopt a red flag law. If passed, the law would not replace the existing statute, but rather make both processes available for use in the state.
Gov. Janet Mills recently argued in an op-ed against the referendum that the co-existence of both policies would “create a new, separate and confusing process that will undermine the effectiveness of the law and endanger public safety along with it.”
But proponents see a red flag law as another tool for keeping Mainers safe that could work in concert with the existing policy without stigmatizing mental illness.
Five years into the yellow flag law
Maine’s existing statute allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation, whereas red flag laws — like the one proposed in Question 2 — allow family or household members to petition a court directly for someone’s firearms to be temporarily removed. 
Since Maine is the only state with a yellow flag law, it would be the only state to see these two laws exist in tandem. 
Michael Rocque, a professor of sociology at Bates College, said the potential for confusion lies in the fact that people still don’t know exactly what a yellow flag is. 
“If we passed the red flag law, I would imagine that that would sort of supersede the yellow flag law in terms of usage,” he said, arguing the nuance of Maine’s yellow flag law would encourage people to opt for the red flag process that presents as more streamlined. 
He pointed to a report from the independent commission that investigated the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston that underscored how confusing the yellow flag process was at that time. 
Use of Maine’s yellow flag law continues to be consistently high

In the aftermath of the shooting, some law enforcement officials said the yellow flag law was difficult to use. This testimony was followed up by a finding from the commission that the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office had sufficient probable cause to both take the perpetrator, Robert Card II, into protective custody under Maine’s yellow flag law and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. 
While it is still time and resource intensive, Lt. Michael Johnston of the Maine State Police said changes made to the yellow flag law last year, as well as additional training for law enforcement, has made it less cumbersome. And there’s data to back it up. 
As of the beginning of this month, the yellow flag law had been used more than 1,100 times. Johnston said 81 of those occurred between 2020, when the law was implemented, and late 2023. More than 1,000 uses occurred in the past two years at a rate of 1.5 per day, he said. 
It takes time to adapt to a new law, but it gets smoother and easier to execute with repetition, Johnston said. And now that law enforcement has more familiarity and practice with the current law, Johnston argued that adding a new policy “could potentially detract, undermine or take away resources from a law” that he believes is working well.
Like Mills, he believes having both laws could create confusion, especially for families who may need to navigate these sorts of supports. 
“It could potentially muddy the waters when it comes to the relief that families are seeking,” he said. “Do they call law enforcement? Do they try to petition the court? Which process do they follow?”
Should mental health professionals be involved?
Critics have also taken issue with the absence of a mental health element in the red flag proposal, while supporters and industry professionals applaud it for separating violence from mental illness.
Maine Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), said mental health is “of the utmost importance here,” and the yellow flag law can connect people with the help and services they may need.
“No person of sound mind is going to want to harm themselves or somebody else… so we need to focus first on the root of the problem and that’s concerning mental health,” she said.
But Jack Sorensen, who does communications for the Maine Gun Safety Coalition and Question 2 campaign, argued that is a misunderstanding of the current law because the stipulated mental health evaluation “is a stamp of approval by a mental health professional that someone should have their firearms removed,” but does nothing to get them actual treatment.
Sorensen also said it’s a misconception that the mental health evaluation in the yellow flag process makes the situation safer because mental health challenges are not a precursor for violence. For this reason, mental health professionals such as the Maine Association of Psychiatric Physicians have voiced their support for Question 2. 
“All of us will experience a moment of crisis in our lives at some point. That doesn’t mean we are mentally ill,” Sorsenson said. “So, conflating mental illness with preventable gun deaths is not only misleading, but it’s dangerous. It’s dangerous because it overlooks the reality of a lot of lives that could otherwise be saved.”
But Johnston with the State Police said most of the scenarios that he’s seen the yellow flag law invoked either involve criminal behavior or, more commonly, a mental health crisis involving someone who is suicidal. 
“The overwhelming majority of them, they are not bad people, they are going through a difficult time,” Johnston said. “They are human beings that are having a hard time for whatever reason.”
Which one would be faster?
Both those for and against the red flag proposal agree that, in the case of someone posing a threat of danger, they shouldn’t be in possession of a firearm. But there are diverging thoughts as to which policy would contain those situations faster, as well as the value of involving law enforcement from the beginning.
Sorenson and the gun safety coalition say that it’s a good thing communities have had more success with Maine’s yellow flag law in recent years. But, he said, “the fact that it has been used more and more underscores the need for these types of laws and the need for a better, proven, more effective tool.”
He argued that the proposed red flag law would separate a dangerous person from their firearms more quickly and efficiently because families can go directly to a court to file a petition. 
Rocque, the Bates professor, argued the two policies could work in tandem. For example, in a case involving a threat of suicide, he said someone could use the red flag process to immediately remove the firearms and then follow up with the yellow flag process to get a mental health professional involved.
But critics question that reasoning since it relies on the availability of the courts and stipulates a 14-day window for a hearing to be held. Johnston pointed out that law enforcement works round the clock, while courthouses could be closed on weekends or have even more limited hours in rural areas. 
If someone came to law enforcement on a Saturday with a concern about a family member posing a risk of danger, for example, Johnston said that would require an immediate response. “Would we tell them to go to the court and petition? The answer is no,” Johnston said.
Early police intervention is a key feature for proponents of the yellow flag process. 
In her recent op-ed, Mills said the yellow flag “gets law enforcement involved early for good reason.”
Johnston also argued the existing law can better protect law enforcement since they are more aware of potential dangers from the start. Showing up to someone’s house to remove weapons after a red flag process has been initiated could require additional officers or resources, he said, because law enforcement would have less information about the situation.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Winter ski season is on the horizon, but New Hampshire is still deep in drought, putting some snowmakers at the state’s mountain resorts on edge. 
With evolving technology and strategic snowmaking, the snowmakers said they expect to keep skiers on the trails this winter despite current water shortages. But like warming winters, recurring late-summer droughts are part of a larger climate change-driven pattern that has complicated the task of running a ski resort in the Northeast. While technology upgrades can help, experts said they also recognize that the industry is changing in ways that can’t be circumvented.
“Now we’re being limited not only by temperature, but potentially by water as well,” said Caitlin Hicks Pries, a Dartmouth researcher and associate professor of biology whose work studying snowpack has intersected with her love of skiing. However, she said, advances in technology — and, potentially, a mindset shift — can help for now.
As of Oct. 7, more than half of New Hampshire was in “extreme drought,” according to an Oct. 9 report from the U.S. Drought Monitor. This reflects a recurring pattern of dry periods in late summer that is driven by climate change, according to New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone.
Ski mountains across the state get their snowmaking water from different sources, some of which are more vulnerable than others to drought-driven water shortages, said Hicks Pries. A spring-fed lake, for example, will be less immediately affected by drought than a stream fed by mountainside runoff.
Regardless, most everyone in the industry senses the urgency of water conservation, said David Ulbrich, mountain operations director at Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, who has also worked at ski resorts in Vermont, Maine, and New York. 
“We’ve definitely, as an industry, had to be smarter with how we’re using our water, because, yeah, we have run into these problems at almost every resort I’ve been at,” he said.
On Oct. 8, Ulbrich had just returned from checking on the runoff-fed stream that Gunstock will dam in late October to create a reservoir for snowmaking. After some morning rain, Ulbrich said he was relieved to find the stream running again after it had gone dry in late summer.
“You can’t take (water) for granted anymore,” he said.
To cope with this reality, coupled with increased temperature ups and downs midwinter that can melt snow off trails, Ulbrich and his crew have adapted their approach to snowmaking, spreading the effort out across the winter season. Traditionally, a snowmaking crew would make all their snow — maybe five feet on a typical trail — in one go at the outset of the season, he said. But this strategy risks losing all that snow, and labor, to a thaw or warm rain midwinter. So, when water is limited and thaws increasingly common, the team has adapted to making less snow at the beginning of the season, then returning to their trails later in the year to add more.
“It does make sense not to put all your snow eggs in one basket,” said Hicks Pries of this approach. But the method also requires more labor and time.
Snowmaking “is one of the most expensive things we have to do, as far as money and power go,” said Erik Barnes, general manager at Ragged Mountain Resort in Danbury. At Ragged, the snowmaking crew generally sticks to making all their snow in one go. They are aided by the fact that Ragged pulls its snowmaking water from a bog, which is generally a reliable source even in times of drought, Barnes said; this year, the driest since at least 1895, its water level is down only a fifth of an inch from its average, he said. 
Ragged is evolving in other ways, including by adopting high-efficiency snowmaking guns. These devices use compressed air to send water misting into the air, where it can freeze and be deposited on the slope as snow. More efficient snowmaking guns can accomplish that with less energy, less air, and less water, said Kris Blomback, general manager at Pats Peak, where the efficient guns are also in use. And making trails as smooth as possible is another way to lessen the amount of snow required for good skiing, Blomback said.
“The technology with the industry has really come a long way in the last two decades, and it’s good to see the commitment here,” Ulbrich said.
Yet, while efficient snow guns and other snow-maximizing measures are becoming an essential part of mountain adaptations, snowmakers are still limited by temperature. When it’s too warm, snowmaking is simply thwarted.
“It’s one of those things that, like, at a certain point, there’s nothing you can do,” Ulbrich said. “You know, at 32 degrees (Fahrenheit), there’s not much technology that’s going to help you make snow if things aren’t freezing.”
Some resorts engage in “snow farming,” using insulation to preserve heaps of snow through above-freezing temperatures so it can later be put to use for winter sports, said Hicks Pries. The technique is practiced at some locations in New England, but is more common in Europe, she said. 
As water scarcity and winter heat waves continue to challenge early-season snowmaking and snow retention, Hicks Pries said her research had led her to a new idea: What if the answer to preserving ski culture in the Northeast is a shift in timing?
“We are having less snow early in the season, less snowmaking weather early in the season,” she said. Meanwhile, though it’s more sporadic, precipitation is on the rise overall — and some preliminary climate data suggest that early spring months are becoming snowier, Hicks Pries said. 
“So, do we have to sort of rethink when the ski season is, and what’s realistic with our new climate?” she asked.
Adjusting to this shift in timing could involve accepting that some traditional ski weeks — like those around the winter holidays — have less reliable snow and may no longer be in the optimal skiing season. But maybe, Hicks Pries said, skiers could make up for that later in the year.
Adapted snowmaking schedules, like what Ulbrich described at Gunstock, seem to reflect the adaptations already taking place in the industry. Meanwhile, resort operators said they were optimistic ahead of this winter’s season that autumn rains would replenish their reservoirs.
“We’re still 45 plus days away from heavy-duty snowmaking so we still have some time for the storm clouds to reappear and right the ship,” Blomback said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/snowmakingnew-1024x796.jpg,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recently announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that starts Oct.14. 
Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others.  
Todd Hicks opened his new CBD store in Columbus days before DeWine announced the ban.

“It’s been heartbreaking,” he said. “Honestly, it’s been totally heartbreaking. I don’t know which direction to go.”
Hicks said he will likely have to close his new shop and let go of his three employees. 
“I can’t afford them,” he said. “Well, there’s nothing for them to do, right? They can’t sell the product. There’s no one going to be answering the door or coming to the door to actually buy the product. So I don’t need them.”
Children getting ahold of intoxicating hemp products is a parental issue, Hicks said. 
“They’re digging it out of their parents’ purse or something like that,” he said. “It’s not a sale issue.”
Mark Fashian, president of hemp product wholesaler Midwest Analytical Solutions in Delaware, Ohio, said the ban will put him out of business. He works with more than 500 stores around Ohio that sell intoxicating hemp products. 
“We typically will sell to smoke shops or gas stations or convenience stores or drive-thrus, and every one of those have a mechanism for carding anyone,” Fashian said. “There is definitely carding happening all over the place.”
He said those shops are worried about how the ban will impact them.   
“They’re just worried,” Fashian said. “They don’t know what to do. They don’t know what to do with their products.” 
Jim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp in Kentucky, which sells its products in more than 300 Ohio retail stores, said the intoxicating hemp ban has caused lots of confusion.

“Our retailer and distributor partners are very unhappy,” he said. “… It’s really frustrating to watch the Republican Party be an anti-business party. … To see the governor and members of the legislature be anti-business on this front is very concerning when other states have been able to figure this out.”
Kim Bryant, a salesperson at Your CBD Store Marion, said the average age of their customer is 50 years old. 
“They want gummies for pain and gummies for sleep,” she said. “People want that instead of opioids or prescription drugs. … The older people, they have no desire to go to a medical marijuana or recreational marijuana facility.”
The store requires ID checks with every purchase, Bryant said.
“I would never, ever, sell anything to a minor,” she said. “I just feel like it’s unfair to the people that are doing all the right things when there’s one bad apple. … . This is a store that actually helps people.”
This ban includes THC-infused beverages, like the ones Collin Castore started selling at his three central Ohio breweries in March. The beverages contain five milligrams of THC. 
“A five milligram beverage is literally the equivalent of taking a puff off the average joint. It’s not rocking anyone’s world and throwing them into a psychedelic experience, 24-hour head trip. It’s just a slight altering of mood,” said Castore, who is the co-founder of Seventh Son Brewery, Antiques on High, and Getaway Brewing. 
These beverages have no alcohol in them and are “tested extensively,” he said. 
“We want this to be regulated,” Castore said. “Let’s keep low-dose THC beverages. Let’s just treat it the same as beer, and regulate it the same as beer, and everybody gets tax revenue from it, and we get to create jobs.”

Castore said their target demographic with THC-infused beverages is 35 to 55 year old women who want to take a break from alcohol — “not 10-year-old children.”
“I’ve really seen these beverages be a great way for some people who need to take a break from alcohol still have a way to relax after work or have a beverage with their friends and not feel excluded,” he said. 
There is a label on the cans saying the drinks are only for people 21 and older, and people are carded to purchase the beverages, just like alcohol, Castore said. 
The THC-infused beverages make up 10-15% of their wholesale business and about 5% on the retail side, Castore said. 
While it’s too early to put concrete numbers on how much revenue will be lost because of the ban, he said it won’t be good for business. 
“We’re gonna go from a year where we might have scraped by at breaking even to a year where we’re probably gonna lose money again, and it’s really frustrating,” Castore said. 
The craft beer industry has faced challenges this year navigating tariffs on aluminum, steel, and malted barley. 
“It just felt like we kind of had a win, and something that was working really well finally, and it’s just been yanked out from under us,” he said. 
Some people have turned to the THC-infused beverages as an alternative to alcohol, Higdon said.
“People are looking to reduce their alcohol consumption or have gone sober from alcohol and have found beverage products to be what they’re looking for, and taking these products away from those folks is particularly frustrating because they are gonna increase their alcohol consumption as a result,” he said. 
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

(Video screenshot courtesy of St. John's Lutheran Church)Growing up in a religious family, Florida Republican state Sen. Alexis Calatayud has seen how many church communities are no longer anchored to a single building in the way they used to be. Her small prayer groups take place over chats these days, not necessarily in person or sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in pews.
With churches in her Miami-Dade County district grappling with shrinking membership and aging buildings, Calatayud thinks those institutions can do good with their unused land, by acting as anchors of new housing rather than as bystanders in neighborhood redevelopment.
“When you look at someone sitting on a small church, on a 10-acre property with a dwindling congregation, the question becomes, ‘How can this entity continue to be the beating heart of the community?’” Calatayud said in an interview.
“I think it’s to create a village, where we can create more housing and even centralize other needs in the community on that land.”
This year, Florida enacted a measure, sponsored by Calatayud, allowing multifamily residential development on land that is both owned by a religious institution and occupied by a house of worship, so long as at least 10% of the new units are affordable. Some housing advocates believe the zoning override has the potential to unlock roughly 30,000 parcels statewide.
Florida’s new law is part of a growing movement known as YIGBY — Yes in God’s Backyard. Touted by many faith leaders, lawmakers and developers, the movement imagines a connection between a religious mission to serve and the very real hurdles of building affordable housing.
Housing advocates worry states can’t fill rental aid gaps if Trump cuts go through

If the U.S. is to meet the nation’s demand for new apartments, developers are going to need land, experts say, and parcels owned by faith-based organizations are starting to become a part of the solution for some states. At the same time, some skeptics question whether the movement could strip local communities of having a say in neighborhood development.
Places of worship are found in every corner of the United States. Land owned by faith-based organizations makes up 84 million square feet in New York City, for example, with enough land for 22,000 units on just the vacant lots and surface parking lots of those organizations, according to the Furman Center of New York University. Elsewhere, HousingForward Virginia says faith-based organizations own 74,000 acres in the state, nearly twice the size of Richmond.
California enacted what is considered the first statewide YIGBY law in 2023. It cleared the way for churches and other places of worship, as well as nonprofit universities, to create affordable housing on their land. It allows landowners to bypass public hearings, discretionary votes by city councils or planning boards, and certain environmental reviews so long as they meet affordability requirements, with at least 75% of the homes affordable for low-income households.
Several states — Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Texas — have considered YIGBY legislation this year, though none has passed. And a bill filed last month in Congress would allow rental properties to be built on currently unused church land with federal assistance.
Opponents of the Colorado bill frame it as state overreach on local zoning decisions and worry about a potential pathway for religious landowners to bypass Fair Housing Act protections for housing applicants who may not share that faith, according to a position paper opposing Colorado’s YIGBY legislation.
Beverly Stables, a lobbyist for the Colorado Municipal League, told Stateline that local governments worry YIGBY bills could undermine constitutional home-rule authority and saddle towns with unfunded state mandates.
“Our members have worked successfully with schools and churches on housing projects already,” she said. “The question is, what problem are we really trying to solve?”
The Rev. Patrick Reidy, an associate professor of law at Notre Dame who has studied the relationship between housing and faith-based organizations, says states and cities are eager to partner with faith-based organizations to use their land.










The decision to change the way church land has been used historically for decades or even centuries is not easy for a place of worship.


– The Rev. Patrick Reidy, professor of law and co-director of the University of Notre Dame’s Church Properties Initiative


It’s not an easy decision for faith leaders to switch the purpose of their land from a devoted congregation space to housing, he said.
“The decision to change the way church land has been used historically for decades or even centuries is not easy for a place of worship to make, so lawmakers should meet faith communities where they are,” said Reidy, who also is co-director of Notre Dame’s Church Properties Initiative.
“It’s more an understanding that the way places of worship approach housing is from a moral mission to serve, so things like financing, zoning and legal know-how to create housing requires some walk-through for faith-based organizations,” Reidy said.
“The real challenge is learning to speak each other’s language.”
‘Right in the middle’
Every afternoon at 3:22, members of St. John’s Lutheran Church in Madison, Wisconsin, pause what they are doing and pray. Whether they are working, at home, watching baseball’s Milwaukee Brewers or sitting in a temporary worship space, they pray at that exact time.
It isn’t random: “322” is the address where the German Lutheran church has stood downtown at East Washington Avenue and North Hancock Street — just a block from the state Capitol — for 170 years, the Rev. Peter Beeson said.
Congregation members no longer worship there because the site could be set for the biggest transformation in its history: trading in stained-glass windows and church pews for a 10-story high-rise that will combine a worship space with more than 100 affordable apartments.
Beeson told Stateline that the congregation moved out of the building in the fall of 2023 for a groundbreaking later that same year.
“Our current building was built in 1905, and was nearing the end of its useful life, with many additions and renovations over the years,” Beeson said. “And it made sense to sacrifice our existing building to build affordable housing plus worship and community space as a way of serving our mission — providing much needed affordable housing for 130 or so families, and providing a home for the congregation for the next 150 years.”
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

The congregation, founded in 1856 by German Lutherans, has evolved with the needs of its community.
The church hosted a men’s homeless shelter for more than 20 years, ran a drop-in center for people with mental illness and offered small-scale aid for residents seeking anything from bus tickets to steel-toed work boots to child care, Beeson said.
Before construction could get underway on the housing project, though, Beeson and the church ran into a familiar issue that constrained housing across the country in 2023 — rapidly increasing construction costs and skyrocketing interest rates.
Beeson said he isn’t deterred. Other projects have taken 10 to 15 years to break ground, he said. “So keeping that timeline in mind, we are right in the middle.”
He believes the project, which has received sizable donations from community members via GoFundMe, is a God-ordained mission to provide a service for its community.
“We are continuing to move forward with the project. There have been setbacks and challenges along the way,” Beeson said. “However, like God led the Israelites through the wilderness with a pillar of fire by day and a pillar of clouds by night, God continues to open doors and pave pathways to bring this project to completion.”
Ceding local control
The economic realities surrounding homebuilding are among many hurdles challenging congregations that want to develop new housing.
In states such as Colorado, local governments worried that a proposed statewide development measure that would give preferential treatment to faith-based organizations could undermine local control and even potentially open the door to religious discrimination.
“Not suggesting it from all entities,” said Stables, of the Colorado Municipal League, “but we were concerned about the potential for discrimination, and potential violations of Fair Housing Act requirements.”
Stables also thinks this year’s legislation was premature, just a year after Colorado lawmakers made sweeping changes to land use rules — including new laws removing parking minimums and encouraging transit-oriented developments and accessory dwelling units — that she said haven’t had time to take effect or be meaningfully implemented locally.
She also said the bill would have stripped local governments of zoning authority while offering no new resources. More than 200 municipalities opted into an affordable housing fund created through a 2022 ballot initiative, Stables said, but the legislature has been sweeping out some of that money for other budgetary needs, leaving cities under-resourced to deliver on those housing goals.
In the end, Colorado’s legislation passed the House but died in the Senate after supporters concluded it didn’t have the votes to pass.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

YIGBY supporters elsewhere have had to balance the tension between state goals and local zoning authority. A 2019 Washington law requires cities and counties to offer density bonuses for affordable housing on religious land — an incentive, but not a legal override of zoning laws.
In Minnesota, state Sen. Susan Pha, a Democrat, told Stateline she modeled some aspects of her YIGBY proposal off the California law. She also tailored aspects of her bill — such as a focus on middle-housing options like small studios — to find solutions that work specifically for her state.
Pha said some of her big battles have been around the allowances of small lot sizes, such as 220-square-foot studio units, which she said the state “really needs” in order to make a dent in its housing shortage.
“The obstacle really is zoning,” Pha said. “If we can change some of those zoning requirements, we could produce more affordable housing and leverage the space and the dedicated work these faith-based organizations already do.”
Pha’s bill failed to reach a floor vote.
Other YIGBY-like policies have passed in localities including Atlanta; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Seattle. Atlanta’s program aims for the creation of at least 2,000 units of affordable housing over eight years.
When New York City passed its City of Yes housing initiative in December 2024, it permitted faith-based organizations to convert underused properties into housing by lifting zoning, height and setback requirements.
Unlocking land, a bit at a time
In an interview with Stateline, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens pointed out that some of the city’s historic churches sit on prime land with underused parking lots that at one time were filled by many of the churchgoers’ cars.
Unlike many developers who might flip properties after short-term affordability requirements expire, Dickens said, churches may offer stability, since their mission is to serve “the least, the less and the lost” — meaning they might be less likely to sell off the property due to market pressure.
Atlanta is working with financial partners such as Enterprise and Wells Fargo to guide faith-based institutions that need that help, he said.
“Churches are usually on great corners, and they’re hallmarks of the community with land that’s underutilized, and their mission aligns perfectly with affordable housing,” Dickens said. “We’ve got churches that say, ‘Teach us how to develop. We have no idea what we’re doing.’”
The potential is vast, experts say. California faith-based organizations and nonprofit colleges own about 170,000 acres of land, equivalent in size to the city of Oakland, and much of it could be developed under the state’s YIGBY law, according to a 2023 report by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.
In North Carolina, congregations have had small successes. A Presbyterian church in Charlotte turned an unused education wing into 21 units of permanent housing, and an Episcopal church in Chapel Hill built three tiny homes on its property for a trio of formerly homeless residents.
Eli Smith, the director of the nonprofit Faith-Based Housing Initiative, argues that state YIGBY laws should ease affordability requirements for small infill projects such as those in North Carolina and allow them to get built more quickly. Otherwise, he said, small churches’ projects “can’t get off the ground.”
“Think of it as a cottage neighborhood tucked behind a sanctuary — people know each other, it’s beautiful, it’s meaningful,” Smith said. “The future of this movement isn’t in [high-rise apartment] towers; it’s in small, intentional communities that fit their surroundings.”

Amber Roldan/Georgia Recorder (file photo)Grab your ID and get ready to head to the polls: Tuesday marks the first day of early voting for the 2025 statewide and municipal election in Georgia.
This year’s Nov. 4 general election is set to include candidates for two seats on the state’s five-member Public Service Commission, the body that regulates utilities like Georgia Power and plays an important role in deciding how much Georgians pay for services like electricity and natural gas. 
Georgia offers three weeks of early voting, which for this election will begin on Oct. 14 and conclude on Oct. 31. Early voting is offered during the week and on some Saturdays at most locations, and will also be available on Sundays in some counties.
What is on my ballot besides the PSC?
The Public Service Commission election will be the only statewide office on the ballot this fall, but some cities and towns are also scheduled to hold municipal elections for offices like mayor, city council, and school board. Some Georgia residents will also be able to vote on local ballot initiatives. To find your sample ballot, visit the secretary of state’s My Voter Page tool online.
Where can I vote early?
Unlike election day voting, when residents must cast a ballot at their assigned polling place, voters are free to visit any early voting location in their county. The Georgia Recorder has compiled a list of early voting locations, which can be viewed in map or list form. Use the search function to more easily find early voting locations in your county.




What do I need to bring with me to the polls?
Voters in Georgia are required to present a photo ID, such as a driver’s license or U.S. passport, when voting in person or by mail. 
According to the secretary of state’s website, accepted forms of identification include: 

A Georgia driver’s license
A student ID from any of Georgia’s public colleges, universities, or technical colleges (private college and university IDs do not count) 
A valid employee photo ID from any agency, branch, department or entity of the U.S. government
A valid U.S. passport 
A valid U.S. military photo ID 
A valid tribal photo ID 

Voters can also present a free Voter Identification Card, which can be issued at any county registrar’s office or Department of Driver Services Office in Georgia.
Those who choose to vote absentee must also submit some form of identification, such as their driver’s license number, along with their ballot. If you don’t have a driver’s license or voter identification card, you can also include a copy of one of the other accepted forms of ID or another document — such as a utility bill or bank statement — that shows your name and address.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-14 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How the biggest health systems in CT are using AI in patient care,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/14/yale-new-haven-health-hartford-healthcare-ai-abridge/,Doctors at Yale New Haven Health and Hartford HealthCare say a new AI tool is transforming how they interact with patients.,"Doctors at Yale New Haven Health and Hartford HealthCare — Connecticut’s two largest health systems — say a new artificial intelligence tool is transforming how they interact with patients during appointments.
The tool, called Abridge, records conversations between doctors and patients during clinical visits and then uses a large language model to produce after-visit summaries.
Steven Zweibel, a physician at Hartford HealthCare and the medical director of innovation at the organization’s Heart and Vascular Institute, said Abridge has freed up his attention during appointments so that he can focus more energy on patient care, instead of furiously typing notes. 
“I wasn’t in front of my computer. I was just sitting there eye to eye with my patient. [It’s] the first time I can remember doing that since before electronic medical records,” he said, recalling his early impressions of the technology.
Once a patient consents to having their appointment recorded, the conversation is captured through either a secure smartphone app, laptop or computer. The technology is HIPAA-compliant, encrypted and built to protect patient information, a spokesperson with Abridge said in an emailed statement. The physician then reviews the notes, makes any edits and submits them directly into the patient’s electronic medical record.

Allen Hsiao, a pediatric emergency physician and chief health information officer at Yale New Haven Health, said nearly all patients agree to have visits recorded once he explains it helps him focus on them. Some ask about data security, and in the rare cases they decline, he said, physicians readily comply.
At Yale, the response to Abridge has been overwhelmingly positive. Over 1,100 physicians at the health system now use the app, and upwards of 80% of those who tried it decided to adopt it — a higher uptake rate by far than any other tool the health system has offered to physicians, Hsiao said. 
One colleague told Hsiao the app was “the best thing since the birth of my children.” Another reported that “the only thing that saves me more time everyday is my car.” Hsiao said Abridge is particularly useful in an emergency setting, where physicians often don’t get the chance to document visits until after the end of a long shift.

“You’re spending a lot of time after hours trying to remember the details from potentially dozens of patients you saw over your shift. You’re exhausted, and it’s probably not the best quality notes,” Hsiao said. “Abridge has really alleviated that.”
Both Hsiao and Zweibel said they’ve been impressed with the level of detail the app picks up during clinical visits. 
Zweibel said he once asked a patient whether he experienced shortness of breath when he climbed stairs. The patient said no, but then his wife, who was also in the room, said it seemed to her like he did. When Zweibel went to look at the notes Abridge produced, it pointed out that the patient did not report shortness of breath, but his wife disagreed.
Barry Stein, a physician and chief clinical innovation officer at Hartford HealthCare, said it’s important to weigh the risk of AI solutions when considering whether to bring them into a health care setting.
“As the excitement and the hype has built, there’s also been an increasing consideration for the risk,” Stein said. “We have to be cognizant of that in health care.”
When considering whether to adopt technology like Abridge, Stein said the key concerns were security and “hallucination” — a term used to describe a situation in which artificial intelligence produces false, incomplete or incorrect information.

Abridge’s security protocols met the standards at Hartford HealthCare, Stein said. Zweibel added that he’s never seen the technology put something in the note that wasn’t actually discussed between him and a patient. And if physicians ever doubt the content Abridge produces, they can click on anything in the notes, and the technology will take them back to the point in the original transcript where the item was discussed.
Like any organization figuring out how to deploy AI tools, the health systems wanted to make sure Abridge was the right fit. To do that, they used a gradual approach.
Hartford HealthCare started with an initial testing phase where 20-30 physicians from across different specialties tried two different products and provided feedback on their experiences, Zweibel said. Once they decided to move forward with Abridge, a broader scope of physicians was invited to use it. Everyone received training documents and a support team was available to immediately respond to any issues that arose. 
“This is huge for us and for provider wellness,” Zweibel said. “When you have a provider who’s happy, that shows in the care and then the interaction with the patient.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0918_SR_HHC-AI029-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-14 05:56:43.003040

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Every year, each town, village, and city holds local municipal elections where important issues like the town’s operating budget are decided and open positions within the town’s government are filled. 
Many of these positions are small but integral to the well-being of the town, like the town clerk or local moderators. The elections are often not as well attended, but they are just as important as the state and federal elections held every two years as many of the local officials who help safeguard our elections are nominated and elected during these meetings.
As someone who has a disability, a great deal of my life has been dependent on social services, many of which are funded by or even directly overseen by state officers. Accordingly, I decided as soon as I turned 18, I would try to participate when possible in my town’s elections. 
Unfortunately, by my early 20s my eye sight — which has always been diminishing due to a rare degenerative condition — started to prevent me from completing my ballot without assistance. I would always ask a moderator or another election official for assistance, and for a long time I did not realize how this might be a problem as I knew many of those officials from living in the town of New Hampton for the lion’s share of my 40 years of life.
When I heard about new accessible voting systems in the early 2000s that would allow a blind person to independently cast their vote, I got very excited, and immediately asked to be able to use it in local elections. But for over two decades the answer from my local election officials was always “that’s not available for the local elections” or “I’m not sure we can get that here; we’re a very small town.” This meant if I wanted to vote, I either had to rely on transcribing my vote for the ballot out loud in the public polling place, or do it at home with a family member. I began to choose the latter, until the accessible system finally came to my town post-COVID.
Now imagine if you go through this process year after year, properly filling out form after form, with no issues. And also imagine if after sending in all the correct information, your town clerk or moderator suddenly calls you to tell you “we can’t submit this.” That’s what is going to happen to countless voters within the state who rely on absentee ballots to cast their votes. For a variety of reasons, many people in New Hampshire vote using an absentee ballot. These voters are unable to vote in person, but still wish to fulfill their most sacred responsibility as a citizen of the great state of New Hampshire.
Recently passed voting laws make it harder to try to be a good citizen. Specifically, the recently enacted Senate Bill 287 makes absentee voting much more difficult. In addition to filling out and submitting a form to request an absentee ballot, you now have to return those forms with very specific forms of identification, including a copy of your photo ID. 
This is a problem because many people don’t have scanners and printers in their house. The alternative is to visit a notary, many of which charge a fee for the service. Voters who do not send a copy of their identification or have their request form notarized will not be able to vote with an absentee ballot. 
Perhaps the most frustrating part of all of this is that this was law enacted in the name of election integrity to prevent so-called “rampant fraud.” I won’t argue that there is no fraud, as there may well be a few unscrupulous voters out there who try to cheat the system. But there is no evidence of this fraud being widespread or rampant. 
These laws will not address any actual instances of voter fraud, but they do make absentee voting much more difficult for the citizens who are unable to vote in person on election day.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/warnerprimary-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-10-14 04:57:04.955962

Making free meals available to all students wouldn’t only produce benefits equal to the costs, it would produce social benefits with a net worth of about $520 million a year, according to an economic analysis released last Monday.
Lower-income Americans have lost significant ground over the past 40 years. In some ways, that trend might be accelerating.
More than 1 in 4 Ohioans are now poor enough to be on Medicaid, for example, and their access to education is diminishing.
Even adjusting for inflation, college tuition has tripled. Meanwhile, when also adjusted for inflation, the maximum available Pell Grant hasn’t budged.
Education is a powerful predictor of future earnings. Yet even after the pandemic, chronic absenteeism in Ohio schools sits at 25.6% — up nine percentage points from its pre-pandemic level in 2018-2019.
And more than half a million Ohio kids — 1 in 5 — are dealing with food insecurity. 
And the state’s schools reported that in the 2021-2022 school year, more than 26,000 of their kids “lacked a fixed, regular, and adequate place to sleep,” the Ohio Housing Finance Agency reported.

Already, more than 60% of students whose schools participate in the national school lunch program are getting free meals. 
What would happen if the state just paid so all students could get them?
State Sens. Louis Blessing III, R-Colerain Township, and Kent Smith, D-Euclid, earlier this year introduced a bill that would extend free meals to all Ohio school kids. But it was assigned to a committee and died. 
At $300 million a year, the program was relatively inexpensive — given that the legislature’s Republican leadership found twice that amount to give the billionaire Haslam family to move the hapless Browns outside Cleveland city limits. 
Three days after receiving the gift, the Tennessee-based moguls bought a $25 million mansion — in Florida.
The Scioto Analysis study used the projected cost of the Blessing bill as a starting point and tried to compare the costs to the benefits.
An obvious benefit would be to ensure that more kids had access to healthy meals.
“… a study comparing schools that offered universal free school meals… to similar schools that did not offer universal free school meals found that children in schools with universal free school meals had lower household food insecurity,” the report said. 
“U.S. data found that universal free school meals provided through the Community Eligibility Provision would make 3% of previously food-insecure children in participating schools food-secure.”
Another benefit would be that if all kids got free meals, then no one would be stigmatized as poor for getting them. 
That one might be hard to measure, but anybody who’s been to school knows how cruel children can be. 
With a quarter of kids already chronically absent, the last thing they need is another reason to want to avoid school.
Other potential benefits are easier to quantify: Money and time saved by families, reductions in obesity, greater administrative efficiency for schools that don’t have to keep track of whose meal bills are paid, and improved lifetime earnings by kids who are well nourished and ready to learn.
The analysis said that last benefit would by far be the most valuable, determining it would create $552 million in annual economic benefit. 
In all, it said, universal school meals would create $52o million more in annual benefits than the program would cost.
“Based on the available research about the health, educational, and economic benefits of universal free school meals for students of all incomes — even those who are already eligible for free meals through existing programs — I believe universal free school meals are a worthwhile investment for Ohio,” Emily Cantrell, the policy analyst who wrote the report, said in an accompanying blog post.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/school-lunch-cdc-image-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-14 04:57:04.955962

(Photo by WEWS.)Ohioans will still be able to have and use “intoxicating” hemp, low-level THC products such as delta 8, during the state’s temporary ban — but it would be illegal to sell it.
Last Wednesday, Gov. Mike DeWine announced in a news conference a state of emergency starting today (Tuesday, Oct. 14) due to the “availability and abuse of intoxicating hemp products remains a serious threat to public health and safety.”
What is intoxicating hemp? What is delta 8, delta 9?
Delta 8 and 9 are cannabinoids produced by the cannabis plant, often manufactured by CBD.
Ohio doesn’t have an age requirement to buy them since it is .3% or less of THC.
Thus, hemp products can be sold almost anywhere in the state, and the government has no jurisdiction over them.
How long has hemp been legal?
Congress’s Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 allowed for hemp products to be sold as long as they have .3% THC or less.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued guidance on their website that under the law, the Drug Enforcement Administration no longer has the authority to seize and criminalize sending or buying seeds with less than .3% THC.
The DEA has also given this statement to numerous attorneys around the country with the same advice, including specifically addressing cannabis.
What is this executive order? What does it apply to?
According to the order, all consumer products containing intoxicating hemp must be removed from public display by all retailers, no consumer products containing intoxicating hemp may be sold or offered for sale during the state of emergency and any retailer who has intoxicating hemp must segregate these units from other merchandise and hold them, or a portion of them, for law enforcement officers or officials of the department of agriculture.
The ban lasts for 90 days.
This means there is a full removal.
Any intoxicating hemp product that isn’t regulated by the state’s marijuana division must be pulled from smoke shops, breweries, convenience stores, or anywhere else they are sold.
This even includes unregulated hemp products sold in marijuana dispensaries, the governor’s team told us.
“This is specifically aimed at synthetic, intoxicating hemp products that can be sold to kids, have no quality control and are simply dangerous,” DeWine said during the press conference.
Can I still buy hemp products by mail?
Case Western Reserve University law professor emeritus Jonathan Entin explained that this is a tricky question.
“Typically, states don’t get to regulate out-of-state actors unless those actors are physically present in the state or the state can say, ‘You have sufficient practical contact with the state that we can regulate you,'” Entin said.
With regard to mail-order sales, the governor’s team said that online sellers must follow state law and not sell to Ohio residents.
If this is about public safety, why not ban alcohol, tobacco and marijuana, too?
All are regulated markets, DeWine and his team said.
“As far as alcohol, it’s totally, it has been regulated, historically, from the state of Ohio,” DeWine said. “We regulate it. The person who is serving that beer, they can lose their license if they’re serving to a minor — that’s the difference.”
Will this ban really last 90 days?
There is only one way it doesn’t.
“The executive order itself is unconstitutional,” Dakota Sawyer, who represents hemp sellers, said.
Titan Logistic Group, Fumee Smoke and Vape and Invicta Partners filed a lawsuit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, saying DeWine is breaking federal and state law by restricting access to these products.
They add that he doesn’t have the authority to make this order, either.
The lawsuit asks a judge to block the state’s ban before it goes into effect.
Can I get in trouble for possessing hemp products during the prohibition?
No. The executive order only bans selling.
Retailers who continue selling intoxicating hemp could be fined $500 each day the products remain on sale. The state will have the authority to seize products if they are still available for sale.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)For decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the First Amendment protects public employees from facing adverse employment consequences for their private expression about matters of public concern, such as the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Meanwhile, it is equally well-established that such protections generally don’t apply to workers in the private sector.
But that distinction didn’t stop Senate President and Republican gubernatorial candidate Ty Masterson, along with fellow Republican gubernatorial candidate Jeff Colyer and Sen. Brad Starnes (R-Wichita), from urging the state Department of Education to fire government employee Katie Allen after she used her personal Facebook account to write the words “well deserved” in response to a post she saw in the aftermath of Kirk’s shooting on Sept. 10.
In a reality-distorting twist, it seems that these officials believe that Allen’s personal expression can be regulated not in spite of constitutional limits on regulation of such expression by government employees, but because she is a government employee.
Masterson told the over 2,500 followers of his “Official Account” on social media platform X that “anyone holding such a belief” about Kirk’s death “should not be employed by the state of Kansas and has no place making policy decisions for our children.”
“I urge Education Commissioner Dr. (Randy) Watson to immediately remove Allen from her position at the Kansas Department of Education,” he continued.
Meanwhile, Colyer wrote on X that KDSE “must fire Katie Allen for cause without delay,” and Starnes told the Kansas City Star that “students deserve better than educational ‘leaders’ who dehumanize people whom they disagree with.”
And after the education department terminated her employment, Masterson and Starnes crowed that they had “demanded her immediate firing and resignation” and that “thanks to swift action, she’s out at KSDE.”
Neither Masterson’s campaign, Colyer’s campaign, nor Starnes responded to a request for comment about whether their public statements infringed on Allen’s rights. But all three of them find themselves as potential witnesses in Allen’s lawsuit against KDSE and Watson filed on Sept. 24.
Although none of those power brokers are named defendants, the lawsuit suggests their statements loom large over Watson’s decision to end Allen’s employment in a manner she claims flies in the face of clearly established law.
 
Protected expression
The first step for Allen to prove her claims is to show that her Facebook comment was protected expression under the First Amendment.
The crucial point here is that even though Allen’s post surely offended the officials who called for her firing, offensiveness alone is not a license for government-sanctioned punishment.
This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a broad range of protected expression in this country, including hate speech and lies. Exceptions to that rule are very narrow but permit regulation for true threats and defamation.
Moreover, it is a foundational First Amendment principle that the government cannot regulate expression simply because it disagrees with that expression. But the officials’ public statements here make clear that they sought her ouster precisely because they disagreed with her point of view.
Here, Allen’s comment was an expression of opinion that did not even reach the threshold of hate speech, let alone true threats or defamation. Her expression was unquestionably protected.
 
Balancing rights
Another element Allen will have to prove to win her case is that the government’s interests as an employer did not outweigh her interest in freedom of expression.
Here, Allen’s comment was live for only a few minutes before, as she put it in the lawsuit, she “thought better of the comment” and deleted it.
Even though the comment was publicly available for only a short time, the lawsuit describes significant blowback against Allen, including that she received “actual or veiled threats” by telephone and email, such as an email titled “resign or die” in which the author threatened to “blow your f*****g brains out if you don’t resign.”
While Allen herself surely suffered, nothing in the documents filed in court so far indicate that KDSE was disrupted because of Allen’s post.
If the agency can’t show that Allen’s comments had a negative effect on its day-to-day operations or otherwise compromised the agency’s ability to perform its duties, it will likely have a difficult time proving that its interests outweighed Allen’s right to post on social media in her private capacity.
In the absence of facts to support a contention that Allen’s comments harmed the agency in a way that justified her firing, the door opens for Allen to argue the actual reason she alleges she was terminated: political pressure from public officials.
 
Motive to fire
It is here that various posts from state officials and candidates for office begin to add up to a paper trail in Allen’s favor.
Allen lost her job less than a week after posting her comment. All three of Masterson, Colyer and Starnes publicly called for Allen’s firing, and at least Masterson and Starnes took a victory lap after she lost her job.
Usually, proving elements in lawsuits requires discovery, but officials’ public statements here afford Allen a head start to argue that her firing was solely motivated by her comment.
 
Fired because of the expression
Finally, Allen must prove that the agency would not have made the same employment decision had she not posted her comment.
Again, the officials’ public statements are a treasure trove of intent. Before Kirk’s death, Allen was little-known. There is no evidence to suggest that she could have been fired for cause.
Meanwhile, these three officials’ public statements highlight the point that Allen’s comment, and likely nothing else, caused her to lose her job.
In their rush to censor private expression by public employees in the name of protecting the public, well-known public figures have done little more than bolster Allen’s case and increase the likelihood that taxpayers will ultimately have to cover attorney fees for litigation Allen should never have needed to file.
The First Amendment protects the right to speak out, even if that speech is offensive. Unless the people we elect start exercising better judgment — such as choosing not to disregard decades of precedent to advance short-term political goals — KDSE won’t be the last agency on the hook for constitutional violations.

Airports across the United States have been experiencing significant flight delays recently because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without pay since a government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2025. Reports suggest employees have been calling in sick in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled since the shutdown began.
The Conversation U.S. asked Brian Strzempkowski and Melanie Dickman, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.
 How is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?

Air traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation – which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump created some uncertainty around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.
Working without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won’t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the most stressful jobs there is.
As a result, there have been reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills.
In the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and threatened to fire these “problem children.”
 What does this mean for people about to take a flight?

Before the shutdown, there was already a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.
A big question on travelers’ minds is whether this will affect air safety.
The air traffic control system is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate.
As an example, Newark Liberty International Airport can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, capacity was limited to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft.
This was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation was personally involved in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity.
 How does the US keep air travel safe?

On a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially “controls” the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system.
When an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport recently reporting that no controllers were available, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.
Staffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace.
 Why was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?

There has been a systemic problem with hiring of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.
Over the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the FAA’s plan to utilize colleges across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem.
Meanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has limited funding from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown can remain for many months after the government reopens.
 What’s the government doing to end the shortage?

In July, Congress authorized over US$12 billion in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system.
Secretary Duffy is currently leading an effort to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an additional $19 billion investment will be needed to complete the task.
The editor’s note was updated to correct the number of flights canceled during the shutdown.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is being pulled in two directions, risking its reputation, public trust and ability to serve Nebraska.
The danger is twofold: a budget process built on flawed data and sidelined governance — and a retreat from purpose into prestige-driven metrics.
On one hand, President Gold has set forth an ambitious “Odyssey to Extraordinary” that imagines Nebraska’s university system as transformative in teaching, research and community partnerships. It outlines bold investments in faculty, student success, cutting-edge research and statewide partnerships with the promise of measurable progress and transparent accountability.
On the other, Chancellor Rodney Bennett has been instructed to implement deep budget cuts that risk undermining the very mission they claim to serve. Facing a $27.5 million deficit, he proposed reductions framed as ‘right-sizing’ but based on flawed data. Though cast as part of the “Odyssey to Extraordinary,” this approach shrinks the vision and undermines its prospects for success.
Getting the data and process wrong
Simply put, the process used to identify programs for elimination was flawed. Faculty report the numbers justifying cuts were incomplete and often wrong. With omissions and misapplications erasing the very signals they were meant to capture, the evaluation is flatly unreliable. Even the arithmetic fails, ignoring revenue these units generate and trading human, reputational and strategic losses for what are, in reality, trivial savings.
Equally troubling is how these analyses were deployed. Faculty learned of them only at the semester’s start — sometimes just days before the public announcement — though the metrics had been in development for months. Administrators call the process ‘collaborative,’ yet faculty report they were shown finished outputs, not invited into the design. Promised qualitative data never materialized, and requests for underlying data have been denied outright, among other procedural missteps.
Together, these choices elevate control over collaboration, compromise the university’s integrity and may be
exposing it to governance, legal, compliance and reputational vulnerabilities.
The risk of prestige undermining purpose
The University of Nebraska is not without guidance for moments like this. The NU Board of Regents’ own governing policies lay out a clear vision of how faculty work should be understood and incentivized: scholarship must include discovery, integration, application and teaching, and it must connect research to Nebraska’s communities.
These are not aspirational. They are binding obligations, reinforced by associations, funders and Nebraska’s communities, all of whom increasingly reward collaboration, practical impact, and work that connects across fields.
Despite this common ground, the budget reduction plan moves in the opposite direction.
It reduces a broad vision to simplistic indicators modeled on the Association of American Universities (AAU), an elite club of research universities that Gold has made into a top priority. AAU metrics elevate prestige, with only token attention to teaching, engagement and community impact. By adopting them as the standard for budget decisions, the plan works against regents’ directives and risks undermining the qualities that make Nebraska’s top public-serving university responsive to the state and its communities.
This tension between purpose and prestige cannot be ignored. Iowa State University, a large, public-serving research university not unlike UNL, recently confronted it with a contrasting response. In 2022, after more than six decades of membership, it chose to leave the AAU to protect its commitment to affordability, student engagement and access. That choice did not slow ISU. It has posted five years of growth, up 21.5% since 2020 to over 31,000 students.
If Nebraska’s leaders are to pursue re-admission to AAU, they must show they can do so without hollowing out the very mission that makes this university indispensable to its people.
So far, though, the budget plan trades extraordinary vision for ordinary reduction, ironically by aiming cuts at programs that are anything but ordinary.
A better way forward
You can’t cut your way to excellence. Budget cuts are painful, but when data are obscured and shared governance sidelined, the damage spreads beyond those cut.
It weakens the ability to recruit and retain talent, exacerbates threats to job growth throughout Nebraska and ultimately drives long-term costs that outweigh any short-term savings.
That is why the current plan should be rejected and restarted. Nebraska deserves a process that is transparent, faithful to its land-grant mission and grounded in credible evidence. Its Carnegie ‘community-engaged’ designation is no side note. Ignoring it in the process discounts the university’s strengths in serving communities and sustaining its national leadership. Leaving teaching, engagement and public commitments out of evaluation confuses prestige with purpose and carries costs Nebraska cannot afford.

They have been scientifically studied, tested, and proven beyond doubt that they are safe and effective.  Vaccines work by training the body’s immune system, which fights against serious outside viruses and bacteria, into forming an effective defense against outside invaders so that a person does not contract the disease they are defending against at all, or experiences the disease in a milder form than if they hadn’t been vaccinated.
For example, measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to humankind, and spreads through the air to anyone nearby a person who is infected.  It most commonly affects young children, often requiring hospitalization, and about one to two of every thousand people infected die from the disease.  It can cause pneumonia, which accounts for over half of measles deaths.  Fortunately, measles can be prevented by a safe vaccine, usually administered in the mumps, measles and rubella (German measles) (MMR) vaccine which can offer lifelong protection. In fact, measles was all but eliminated from the United States until some misinformed people deferred vaccinating their children.
Vaccines not only offer protection for the person who receives a vaccine, but it also protects entire communities through what is called ‘herd immunity.”  This is when enough people in a community have achieved immunity against a particular virus or bacteria so that it becomes harder for the infection to spread to others, as well as harder for the offending disease to mutate into stronger forms of the infectious agent.
Unfortunately, some people have been misinformed about the safety and benefits of vaccines.  This misinformation is often spread by social media, and by individuals who lack the scientific background to understand how rigorously vaccines have been studied, tested, and found to be safe before being approved for use in people.
Today, due to political rather than scientific reasons, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has lost many of the world’s leading vaccine experts.  The government oversight of this agency is led by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has long proffered false and misleading information on vaccine safety, and he has appointed people with similar viewpoints to a committee that determine what vaccines might be recommended and who should receive them.
Gov. Ned Lamont, and Dr. Manisha Juthani, the infectious disease specialist who is Commissioner of Public Health, should be commended for becoming concerned that the politicization of the CDC vaccine committee might make it difficult for Connecticut citizens to access the needed vaccines. 
They are respectful of the longstanding vaccine recommendations that have protected our state residents, including especially young children, the elderly, and pregnant women from mumps, measles, rubella, hepatitis B, flu, Covid-19, tetanus, and diphtheria, whooping cough, meningitis, certain types of pneumonia, and cervical and some other types of cancer. Under their leadership, Connecticut has joined the Northeast Public Health Collaborative along with Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York (including New York City), Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  
The goals of the collaborative are “to protect the health and well-being of its citizens, to share the best scientific expertise, to strengthen the region’s readiness to address any public health threats, and to strengthen confidence in vaccines and science-based medicine.”  The intent is to do this by providing information based on science, data, and evidence and to work to assure access to needed vaccines.
We in the public health community– health care providers, professors in public health, and public health career professionals — fully support the state’s effort to assure vaccine availability to all residents, especially beneficiaries of public insurance programs like Medicaid.  We hope that commercial insurance companies in Connecticut follow the state’s lead and follow science-guided evidence to make certain that their beneficiaries also continue to have vaccine access.

It is about us. It is about choosing a future rooted in courage, community, and continuity.","Serving you on the Stratford Town Council has been one of the greatest honors of my life. When I was first elected in 2023, I promised to listen, to learn, and to work hard. Two years later, I am proud of the progress we have made together.
I am running for re-election because I want to build a better future than the tomorrow I see on the horizon. In recent years, I’ve learned that steady progress, patching up neglected sidewalks, improving our public safety response, expanding green space matters more than loud headlines. Those small steps, done well, build trust.

Anthony Afriyie
During these two years on the town council:

We passed a local ban on street takeovers —protecting pedestrians, drivers, and first responders.
We committed $1 million to acquire and preserve open space, safeguarding the 401-acre Roosevelt Forest for generations to come.
We launched a major initiative to protect our Water Pollution Control Facility from future storms.
We stood tall in the face of a crisis by approving a $130,000 loan to replace boilers at Success Village, safeguarding the lives of hundreds of families.
We invested in the Stratford Library with a major upgrade to its heating, cooling, and lighting systems, ensuring a safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient space for residents year-round.

My goal is simple but vital: to keep Stratford safe, welcoming, and sustainable for every resident. 
Yes, we still have opportunities to work toward: blighted buildings, traffic congestion, budget pressures, and gaps in community services. But I believe we are close to turning the corner, and I am committed to helping lead us forward.
I seek re-election not out of ambition, but out of duty to serve with humility, persistence, and respect for all voices. The obstacles ahead are real, but so too is our collective strength to overcome them, together.
This election is not about me. It is about us. It is about choosing a future rooted in courage, community, and continuity. I’m asking for your vote, your feedback, and your partnership. Together, let’s keep building a town where our best days are ahead, not behind.

And now she has to add the chore of finding new Medicare insurance plan to her challenges.
Eyler, who learned recently that she will lose her Medicare Advantage plan with Aetna, is one of thousands of Maryland seniors expected to receive notice this month that their supplemental Medicare plans will no longer be available next year, sparking frustration, fear and confusion.
“I’m very happy with Aetna, I haven’t had any issues with them,” Eyler said. “I’m just frustrated with the state of Maryland that they can’t give the older people better insurance.”
Insurance carriers say that Maryland’s unique hospital system is costly for them to do business in, and several are reducing their coverage in the state or pulling out of counties entirely. But that leaves residents like Eyler forced to navigate finding a new health care plan for next year.
“I’m taking care of him,” she said of her grandson, “plus having to worry about all this insurance stuff. And I have to work because I can’t pay the bills without working.”
Maryland market threatens to push more Medicare Advantage plans out of the state

Dean Slaughter, a 70-year-old Annapolis resident, is tired of having to change Medicare Advantage plans year after year. He recently got a letter from Aetna as well, telling him that his plan will no longer be available in 2026.
“Now we get to sit down and do the dog-and-pony show – see what’s out there, which is not much to offer. The insurance companies are leaving the state of Maryland,” Slaughter said.
Industry experts say as many as 100,000 Medicare recipients in Maryland, like Slaughter and Eyler, will have to scramble to find a new health care plan by the end of the year or risk losing coverage at an age where many require costly medical care.
About a quarter of Maryland Medicare recipients use a supplemental program called Medicare Advantage that helps retirees use a private insurer for additional health coverage such as vision, dental and transportation assistance that the standard Medicare plans may not offer.
But there’s been a long-running problem that’s coming to a head: State officials and people in the health care industry say the Medicare Advantage market in Maryland is more expensive than in most other states because of Maryland’s unique hospital payment system.
In recent years, the state has offered insurers a grant to help cover some of their costs and encourage them to keep offering the coverage in the state. That grant is going away, however, and some insurance companies have shrunk their presence in the state as a result.
A spokesperson for Humana said that the insurance company will no longer offer one of its Medicare Advantage plans in five major Maryland jurisdictions.
“Humana has exited one Medicare Advantage plan in Maryland for next year,” according to the statement. “Beginning Jan. 1, 2026 … Humana Gold Plus SNP (HMO DSNP), will no longer be available in the following counties: Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Harford, Howard and Baltimore City.”
Humana says that those affected by the termination will maintain their current coverage through Dec. 31, 2025, but they will need to find new coverage during the Medicare Annual Election Period, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7, if they want coverage next year.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Aetna shrunk its Medicare Advantage coverage to just three counties next year.
“Each year, we assess our ability to meet the health care needs of our members and adjust our plans to ensure they can deliver an excellent and sustainable member experience,” a spokesperson for Aetna said in a written statement. “In 2026, in Maryland, we will offer Medicare Advantage in the following counties: Frederick, Harford and Montgomery.”
Part of the issue comes from Maryland’s unique Total Cost of Care hospital payment model, in which a state board called the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) sets hospital rates. Under the current system, insurance carriers pay higher hospital rates than in other states and get reimbursed by the federal government for Medicare Advantage services at lower rates than elsewhere. Meanwhile, insurance carriers are unable to negotiate hospital rates under their plans.
As a result, it’s more expensive to use Medicare Advantage in Maryland than in other states, and Maryland seniors aren’t getting the same quality of benefits, a spokesperson for CareFirst said in a recent statement.
Insurers reducing their footprint in the state leaves residents like Jie Shen, a 68-year-old living in Cockeysville, having to look for a new plan. That often means finding new doctors and hospitals for health care services.
“This is getting very frustrating,” Shen said. “I just want to stay on one plan at this point. I don’t know which one to choose.”
While there is time to search for a new plan, Medicare Advantage recipients note that the options available in Maryland are dwindling as carriers pull out of the state.
“It’s a hassle,” Slaughter said. “All of a sudden, you’re working with people who don’t even know you, and it’s not the way I want it … I feel like I am a number, and a cattle in line instead of a person, and it’s degrading.”
Even those who will still have their plans in 2026 are worried about what may come down the pipeline later.
Bumps AHEAD: Trump administration evaluating Maryland’s authority to set Medicare rates

Sharon Vickers, 78-year-old resident of Pasadena, was relieved to hear that her Medicare Advantage plan with CareFirst will continue into next year.
“I was concerned. Especially since my husband has passed, not having someone to sit and talk about it and discuss it,” she said.
As many Medicare recipients do, she works with an insurance broker to help find appropriate coverage for her needs. The broker informed her that she would be “comfortable this year,” but that he couldn’t “guarantee anything for next year.”
But she feels that the Advantage plans are already too expensive for what they offer and may skip out on coverage entirely.
“I may be looking at one day not being able to afford health care coverage,” Vickers said. “I’ll do what I have to do when the time comes, and that may mean going without health care.”
Meanwhile, the Maryland model is undergoing a major transition this year, as state health officials and federal officials finalize new terms of the States Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development, or AHEAD, model.
Current negotiations appear to prompt the state to offer solutions to the stabilize Medicare Advantage. There may also be significant changes to the state’s Medicare rate-setting authority.
Shen, like other Medicare recipients, hopes something can be done so that insurers will stay in the state.
“I don’t know if the state can help, but that’s what I ask for,” he said. “They should do something.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-newsletter-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-10-14 06:56:39.862711

Jackson has since been named acting state's attoroney and now says she wants to run for the seat permanently in 2026. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Tara Jackson, the one-time acting Prince George’s County Executive who was sworn in less than four months ago as interim Prince George’s County state’s attorney, will seek the position permanently.
Jackson announced her intentions to run for county executive last month on social media. An official launch is still being planned, but according to her campaign website, a fundraiser will be held Nov. 5 hosted by Floyd Holt and Barry Stanton, two former longtime county administrators — the job Jackson held before becoming acting county executive last year when Angela Alsobrooks left the office to be sworn in as U.S. senator.
When then-State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D) won the county executive’s job in a special election this summer, Jackson was picked by the county’s circuit court judges to become acting state’s attorney. She began her legal career in the office as an assistant state’s attorney.
“From the courtroom to county leadership, I’ve led with fairness, integrity, and results. Prince George’s County deserves a State’s Attorney who has already proven she can deliver,” she said of her campaign.
But she won’t be campaigning alone. Prince George’s County Councilmember Wanika Fisher (D) is also planning to run for state’s attorney and will have two events this month.
The first one will feature public endorsements Wednesday from two union locals — United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 400 and Local 1994. Fisher will be with Local 400 at the Giant Food store in Largo at 10 a.m. and then two hours later with Local 1994 at the New Carrollton Branch Library.

Fisher will host her official campaign launch Oct. 21 at Newton White Mansion in Mitchellville centered on four topics: social justice, criminal justice, public safety and advocacy. Fisher, who previously served in the General Assembly, is scheduled to be joined by state Sen. Nick Charles, House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis and Del. Adrian Boafo, all Prince George’s County Democrats. Former U.S. Rep. Al Wynn is also scheduled to attend, according to the campaign announcement.
“My career in politics has spanned over 20 years. I started advocating for safer sidewalks at age 12 and
have been involved with local politics ever since,” Fisher said in a statement. “I have served as an
Assistant State’s Attorney, a Delegate, and a Council Member. I am ready to continue bringing my experience and passion for justice to Prince George’s County as the next State’s Attorney.”
The primary election will be held on June 23, 2026, with early voting from June 11-18. Early voting for the general election runs from Oct. 22-29, 2026, and Election Day is Nov. 3, 2026.
That may seem like a long way off, but not to the candidates who are already lining up for federal state and local seats next year.
Congressional races getting crowded already
Shavonne Hedgepeth announced Monday that she will challenge two-term Rep. Glenn Ivey in the Democratic primary for the Prince George’s County based 4th District seat.
Hedgepeth, who works in capital planning for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, has not held office before but is stressing her civic and volunteer work in her campaign announcement. Her campaign focuses on reliably Democratic issues — economic and food security, school funding and protecting immigrant communities, among others — and said that while she “may not know every lever of government yet, … I know how to ask the right questions, build coalitions, and hold decision-makers accountable.”
In Ivey, she faces a two-term incumbent with extensive experience in federal and local government, including time as a Capitol Hill staffer and two terms as Prince George’s County state’s attorney. He reported having $295,990 in the bank as of June 30, the most recent report to the Federal Election Commission.
But Hedgpeth is not the only challenger. Jakeya Johnson, the executive director of Reproductive Justice Maryland, has also announced a primary challenge to Ivey. She has filed with the FEC, but has not reported any fundraising activity yet.
Johnson has not filed with the Maryland State Board of Elections — Hedgepeth has — but has until February to do so. Republican George McDermott has also filed for the seat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But the 4th District is among the least crowded so far, at least according to the elections board’s list of 2026 candidates.
The only incumbents to file for reelection so far are Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) and Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th). But Elfreth already has a Democratic and a Republican filed for her seat and Mfume has a Republican challenger in his heavily Democratic district, but could face a bigger threat from Baltimore City Councilmember Mark Conway, who filed recently paperwork with the FEC.
Seven people — two Democrats, two Republicans, two unaffiliated candidates and a Green Party candidate — have already filed with the state to run for the seat held by first-term Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th). She has not yet filed for reelection.
And in the 5th District, five candidates have lined up — four Democrats and an unaffiliated candidate — to either take on longtime Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer, or run for his open seat should he choose not to seek a 22nd term in Congress. Guessing whether Hoyer, who will be 87 next summer, will run again is the parlor game of the moment for the politically obsessed in Maryland.
Get out your scorecards
Other campaign announcements that have come over the transom in recent weeks, in brief:

Former St. Michael’s Town Commissioner George M. Walish announced a Democratic bid to unseat Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st), the only Republican in the state’s congressional delegation, in the Eastern Shore-based district. Walish announced Sept. 10 so has not yet filed a campaign report with the FEC, unlike the other Democrat in the race, Daniel Schwartz, who reported having $45,222 on hand in June. Harris reported having more than $325,000 in the bank.
Amar Mukunda, a veteran, son of immigrants and gun-control advocate, has filed as a Democrat for a House of Delegates seat in the already crowded District 39 race. The district incumbents — Sen. Nancy King and Dels. Lesley Lopez, Greg Wims and Gabriel Acevero — have all filed for reelection, but King, Lopez and Wims have not included the fiery Acevero on their slate, the Baltimore Banner reported last week. They have added Robert Wu, instead.
The three Republican incumbents in the Upper Shore legislative District 36 — Dels. Steve Arentz, Jay Jacobs and Jeff Ghrist — have filed for reelection as a slate. According to their announcement, they have the support of district Sen. Stephen S. Hershey, who is currently weighing the possibility of a Republican run for governor in 2026.

The storm tore homes from their foundations and sent them floating away. 
One woman was found dead in Kwigillingok on Monday, according to Alaska State Troopers.

The search for two more people unaccounted for in that community will continue, by boat and air, the state troopers said on a Facebook post. Search and rescue is being conducted by the U.S. Coast Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and Alaska Air National Guard, as well as state troopers. 
The storm damaged boats, roads, airports, and power and sewer infrastructure over a vast region, and damage assessments were not immediately available as emergency rescue efforts entered a second day. 
“We’re moving quickly. We’re moving as fast as we can,” said Gov. Mike Dunleavy at a news conference in Anchorage on Monday with state officials and the congressional delegation. 
Fifty-one people and two dogs were rescued in Kwigillingok and Kipnuk on Sunday, Troopers said, located on the Bering Sea coast. Those predominantly Alaska Native coastal communities saw the most severe impacts of the storm, with a storm surge of up to 6.6 feet above normal and high winds that inundated communities.
“Preservation of life is our top priority,” said Capt. Christopher Culpepper, commander of U.S. Coast Guard Sector Western Alaska and U.S. Arctic. 
“Several of these villages have been completely devastated,” Culpepper said. “Absolutely flooded, several feet deep, and so this took homes off of foundations. This put people in peril, where folks were swimming, floating, trying to find debris to hold on to in the cover of darkness, at nighttime.”

“And so as the sun broke on the first day, devastation became more and more apparent,” Culpepper said, referring to Sunday as the storm lifted. “Coast Guard helicopter crews, along with Army National Guard and Air National crews, particularly two pairs of rescue jumpers that also assisted … picked people up off their homes,” he said, and were taken to higher ground. Several people were medically evacuated to Bethel.
Some people trapped in floating homes early Sunday used their cellphones to call for help. Some of those calls reached the State Emergency Operations Center, said incident commander Mark Roberts. 
“The folks that were in houses that were floating and didn’t know where they were, was one of the most tragic things our folks in the state EOC have ever faced,” Roberts said. “And some of them called into the state EOC, and we just stayed on the phone with them to talk.” 
Members of the Alaska National Guard and Alaska State Defense Forces living in western Alaska, up to 80 personnel, have been activated, said Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which oversees the Alaska National Guard.
“This may end up being the largest off-the-road-system response for the National Guard in about 45 years,” Saxe said. 
Over 50 airports were impacted by the storm but largely cleared as of Monday to allow planes to land with emergency supplies and personnel. The coastal communities throughout the region are only accessible by small plane or boat. “There also have been numerous reports to us of roadway damage, boardwalk damage – boardwalks are the roads in this region – and then also the various power outages and lighting problems throughout the region,” said Ryan Anderson, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Transportation. 
More than 1,000 people were displaced from their homes across the region, according to estimates from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, the region’s largest healthcare provider. 
Roughly 400 people are sheltering in the local school in Kwigillingok, and 680 people in Kipnuk are at the school there, they said. Thirty seven homes in Kwigillingok were destroyed. 
Emergency supplies, including water, food, hygiene products, baby formula and bedding are being flown into coastal communities, according to a statement on Monday by YKHC.  “The need is great,” they said. The response effort is coordinated between YKHC, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), the Association of Village Council Presidents and the state of Alaska, to assess and respond to community needs. 
Medical providers and prescription medications were being sent to Kwigillingok, Kipnuk, Tuntutuliak and Chefornak, they said, and plans were underway to evacuate about 40 people, including elders and pregnant women, to Bethel. 
Alaska State Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, said over 1,000 emergency meals had been delivered already to coastal villages, but those supplies would run out.

“They need additional food supplies, and it’s difficult to get people out there,” he said.
He said Kipnuk’s runway was still damaged, and planes could not land there. Power is still out there as well. “There has to be a short-term assessment done of those homes that are out there, whether they are livable or not livable … and needs to be made as quickly as possible,” Hoffman said. “Winter is coming.”
The state of Alaska has activated a multi-agency emergency response, and with the governor’s extended disaster relief declaration, residents and communities are eligible for recovery assistance, including temporary housing assistance. 
“We’ve had a few injuries; we’re moving into a higher-level care as needed, and then we’re moving right on in to support sheltering, and then right on into the next to support the ability for people to live in a safe, warm place through the winter,” Roberts said. 	
The Alaska Community Foundation has set up a fundraising effort, the Western Alaska Disaster 2025 Relief Fund, for affected communities. 


U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he was communicating with officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who would provide assistance. 
“FEMA right now is in direct contact with our state and local officials and has an incident management team on the ground and a FEMA search and rescue group pre-positioned on standby,” Sullivan said. “As we move into the recovery phase – and we’re not there yet – the federal agencies need to act very quickly. We’re going to be seeing freeze-up and very cold weather, probably quite soon. So they have committed to being very ready to move into that phase of operations once we get there.” 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, underscored the trauma residents are experiencing from this disaster. “When the waters subside, when the analysis is complete — we have many, many families (and) we have communities that are in trauma, that will be in shock over the loss and so, making sure that we have trauma specialists, if you will, that are culturally in tune with the region and with the people there is something that I think we all need to be challenged to think about,” she said. 
While the Trump administration has recently cut or frozen significant amounts of federal funding for rural Alaska, like for infrastructure and climate resilience initiatives, Murkowski said she will continue to push officials for federal support. 
“I think this disaster that we are seeing is yet one more reason why the delegation needs to lean in and make sure that the administration fully understands the value of what it means to to have a level of preparedness, to have a level of resilience in an area that is so exposed on our western flank,” she said. 
This week’s disaster came as the remnants of Typhoon Halong battered the region Saturday night into Sunday, sweeping north across the western Alaska coast. The National Weather Service reported hurricane-force winds up to 107 mph in the Kusilvak Census Area, 100 mph in Toksook Bay and 98 mph in the island of St. George in the Bering Sea.
The storm has now weakened over Canada and is moving east, said meteorologist David Kramer, but flood warnings are still in effect for the Kuskokwim Delta and western and northwest Arctic coasts through Tuesday.
Another storm is forecasted for the Kuskokwim River delta region early on Wednesday morning, with winds gusting up to 40 mph from the southeast, and water levels from one to three feet. 
“From the records that we set recently, over six feet, this is significantly less impact,” Kramer said. “The main concerns are high water levels, rough surf and the potential for some coastal erosion.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Maryland is the lead state, joined by 24 other jurisdictions, on a legal brief filed Saturday that calls the Trump administration’s attempted deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois “unlawful, unconstitutional and undemocratic.”
The 22-page brief, filed in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asks the court to reject the administration’s request to deploy guard troops in an American city, saying it violates federal law and usurps local government.
“President Trump’s use of the National Guard to patrol American cities without the consent of state leaders is an outrageous abuse of power based on politics, not public safety,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement announcing the filing.
“This is the fourth time in four months that the President has deployed the Guard to a city without approval from its leaders,” Brown said. “Without intervention from the courts, this unconstitutional, unlawful, and un-American politicizing of our military could become the new normal.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
The appeals court ruled Saturday that while the guard can remain under federal control, it cannot be deployed in Illinois as appeals continue. It follows a temporary restraining order issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge April M. Perry that would have enjoined both “the federalization and deployment of the National Guard of the United States within Illinois.”

President Donald Trump (R) on Oct. 4 called for federalization of at least 300 Illinois National Guard members to protect federal property “at any locations at which violent demonstrations prevent the execution of Federal law or are likely to prevent the execution of Federal law based on current threat assessments and planned operations.”
The president began his push to deploy troops in June, when he ordered the guard into California after protests over immigration raids there. As of Oct. 6, California had filed 42 lawsuits against the Trump administration, according to CalMatters, a partner with States Newsroom.
In August, the president declared a “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C., and deployed National Guard troops and also took control of the city’s police department for about 30 days. District officials filed a lawsuit against the administration. A hearing is set for Oct. 24.
The Maryland-led amicus brief comes three days after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed temporary federalization of the Oregon’s National Guard, but blocked those troops from being deployed in the state as the case remains pending.
Trump has also suggested sending troops to other cities, including Baltimore. Guard troops were deployed in Memphis last week, but they were under the control of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee and welcomed as part of a federal task force, unlike the other cities where mayors and governors have actively opposed the deployment.
For Brown’s office, Saturday’s brief represented the 63 amicus brief filed this year in opposition to Trump administration actions. His office has also either led or joined in 38 lawsuits against the administration so far, according to the attorney general’s office.

(Emily Reddy/WPSU)Penn State University’s Board of Trustees unanimously approved the sale of university-owned public broadcaster WPSU’s operating assets to Philadelphia-based WHYY. 
The vote Monday follows the board’s unanimous objection last month of a different proposal that would have transferred WPSU to the Philadelphia NPR and PBS affiliate. Members cited concern about the cost to the university without a guarantee WHYY would continue to operate the stations or retain employees.
WPSU was set to be the first public media organization to wind down operations by June 2026 following cuts made by President Donald Trump’s administration to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
Chairperson David Kleppinger said the board of trustees received over 1,300 public comments and emails regarding the future of WPSU before Monday’s vote. 
“The overwhelming majority urged the university to reconsider the decision to wind down WPSU’s operations, or to move forward with a sale that would allow the station to continue under public broadcasting organizations,” he said.
Although he said there were a few who expressed differing views, the consistent theme across the comments was strong support for maintaining WPSU’s public media service. 
“Commenters emphasize WPSU’s importance to Penn State’s land grant mission, its educational and cultural value to children and families, especially in the rural areas of Central Pennsylvania, and its role in providing experiential learning opportunities for our students,” Kleppinger added. “Many also noted the station’s history of trusted local journalism and community engagement, and urged the board to find a sustainable path forward that preserves those contributions.”
Sara Thorndike, senior vice president for finance and business/treasurer, said the university currently provides about $3.4 million annually to support WPSU and that the university recently lost $1.8 million in federal funding.
In the proposed transaction approved Monday, the university will not have to pay a $17 million subsidy, which was included in the prior proposal. Instead, WHYY will first secure at least $8.36 million in outside financing.
The agreement allows Penn State to hear from others who might be interested in buying WPSU, but does not allow them to sign any other agreements while they are working towards a definitive agreement with WHYY. Thorndike said this also allows WHYY time to raise the funds needed to support WPSU.
“We can continue to use gifts that are needed in order for WPSU to operate over this next year, but we have agreed that we will not liquidate any of the endowments during that exclusivity period,” Thorndike said. 
Addressing a major concern for the board in its decision to reject the earlier proposal, WHYY has agreed to interview current WPSU employees for positions under the new ownership.
“If there are employees who are qualified for jobs that WHYY have determined are needed, employees will be hired into those positions if they so choose to move to WHYY,” Thorndike said.
WHYY also assured the board that it will continue to operate WPSU for at least three years. 
“This is in response to the board’s concern that if we sold all of the assets to WHYY for the dollar that they could monetize them,” Thorndike said. “That is not their intent, and they agree to keep WPSU open for three years, although they have indicated a desire to keep it going for much, much longer than that.”
WHYY can also not sell any non-core assets without the permission of Penn State. 
“There may be a need to do that, as they’re continuing to fund WPSU, but they will do that in partnership with approval by the university,” Thorndike said. 
Thorndike also noted that WPSU would still offer programs to students such as internships, work-study, and other supportive student curriculum.
WHYY intends to lease the on-campus space where WPSU is currently located, close to the university’s College of Communications. 
The agreement is dependent on approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
and WHYY will pay filing fees associated with the request, Thorndike noted. Penn State has indicated it wants to close the deal no later than June 30, 2026. 
In addition to PBS and NPR programming, WPSU provides local programming, news coverage, and community events in the region. WPSU-TV reaches 515,000 households in 24 counties of central Pennsylvania, and WPSU-FM serves more than 450,000 listeners in 13 counties in central and northern Pennsylvania.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/penn-state-old-main-1024x747.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 21:56:16.672452

Then she hid under a Jeep, watching as “guys with black T-shirts” shot at the sidewalk in her hometown in the Mississippi Delta.
She was sure she was going to get hit in the explosion of gunfire Friday night in Leland at a block party following a high school homecoming football game. She did but was not seriously wounded.
“I got hit running across the street. I just kept running. I could see the bodies dropping as I looked back. … I could see the bodies. … Just three minutes of continuing fire,” Jackson, a 2016 Leland High graduate, recalled Monday.
“I could see people drop like something you see in a movie,” she said. “It was panic. Everyone was in survival mode. People running and getting trampled. Some guy was having a seizure near me. It was pure panic.”
Mississippi communities from Leland to Lorman are reeling from the chaos of gun violence that killed nine people and wounded more than a dozen during or after high school and college homecoming celebrations Friday and Saturday.
Leland became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year when six people were killed and 20 were wounded in gunfire that erupted late Friday during a celebration downtown that included people who had returned to the small town to see friends and family.

“It’s sad that we’re now known for a mass shooting. It had nothing to do with the school or the students,” Leland nonprofit leader Jasmine Styles said Monday, hours before the community held a candlelight vigil to honor victims of the violence.
“The most we’re used to is kids stealing license plates off cars,”  she said. “The most we saw recently was kids setting off firecrackers at the tailgate, and people thought they were gunshots.”
Styles, who ran unsuccessfully for mayor, said she drove by downtown Leland on Sunday.
“It’s been taped off,” she said. “It looks like a cloud of gloom.”
The FBI Jackson office set up a digital media tips website where people with information can anonymously share cellphone video, photos or other information about the Leland shooting.
Elsewhere in Mississippi, two died in gunfire after the Heidelberg High School homecoming Friday night, including a pregnant woman. On Saturday, the Alcorn State University homecoming in Lorman ended in the shooting death of a 29-year-old Vicksburg woman and the wounding of two others.
The condition of a child shot in the abdomen in the tailgate area after the Jackson State homecoming Saturday in Jackson is unknown.
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting local and federal law enforcement agencies in investigating the shootings. No arrests had been made by Monday in the JSU or Alcorn State shootings.
Washington County coroner LaQuesha Watkins identified the Leland victims as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr., 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34.
Brekyra Fisher, 29, of Vicksburg, died in the shooting at Alcorn State, according to Claiborne County Coroner Kieon Neal. 
Maxine Greenleaf, vice president of marketing and communications at Alcorn State, said the victim was not a student. A university statement said the campus in rural southwestern Mississippi now has “heightened security measures in place.” 
“Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of the deceased,” the university statement said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured individuals and their families as well.”
Anyone with information is urged to contact Campus Police at 601-877-3000 or MBI and Crime Stoppers at 888-827-4637 or MBITIPS@dps.ms.gov.
The student government associations at Alcorn State and JSU released a joint statement that they “stand together – united as one HBCU.”
“Our shared legacy as Mississippi’s two premier HBCUs calls us to uplift one another – not only in moments of celebration, but also in times of challenge.”
The Jasper County coroner’s office identified the Heidelberg victims as Mikeia McCray, 28, of Laurel, who was pregnant, and Chris Newell, 35, also of Laurel. 
“The town has never experienced anything like this before, and my heart goes out to those devastated by this tragedy,” state Sen. Juan Barnett, former mayor of Heidelberg, said Monday. “It brings tears to my eyes right now. It really hurts.”
Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said Monday the department and other agencies continue to investigate. The town is about 85 miles southeast of Jackson.
Tylar Jarod Goodloe, 18, was arrested Saturday by the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department in the Heidelberg shooting. He is charged with capital murder and possession of a deadly weapon on educational property. His bond is set at $2 million cash, according to the sheriff’s office. It wasn’t known Monday whether he is represented by an attorney.
Three other suspects were arrested Monday: 19-year-old Damarin Starks, charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with physical evidence; 19-year-old Jadarius Quartez Page, charged with accessory after the fact; and 19-year-old Jabari Deshaun Collins, charged with possession of a deadly weapon on educational property. 
Barnett knows what it’s like to have a loved one’s life stolen. While he was fighting in Desert Storm, his father was killed in Heidelberg in 1991. 
“People sympathize,” the senator said, “but the hurt is not the same.”
The East Jasper School District released a statement Saturday saying the violence marred what should have been a joyful evening.
“These actions are not representative of the values, strength, or character of our community,” the statement said. “East Jasper and Forever Blue and Gold Homecoming are a place and time where families come together, where neighbors support one another, where alumni come from far and near with excitement and anticipation, and where our schools are centers of pride and belonging.”
Community members on social media said McCray was a Heidelberg High School graduate from the Class of 2016. 
The school district said it has fully cooperated with local and state law enforcement during the investigation, but understands there will be “questions, concerns, and fear in the aftermath of this tragedy.” 

“While this brings no comfort to the families and friends impacted, please know that the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and community still remain our highest priorities.” 
Sen. Derrick Simmons, who represents Leland, called the shootings “just senseless gun violence.”
“What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.” 
Styles, who operates a pre-trial diversion program in Leland, echoed those thoughts..
“To my knowledge, nothing like this has happened in my 31 years of living in Leland,” she said. “How are they getting access to weapons and alcohol? There must be adults giving it to them.”
Jackson, one of the shooting victims in Leland, said her fondest memories growing up were from homecoming.
“Homecomings are usually filled with love. We have Block Party Saturday and Family Fun Day Sunday,” she said. “It’s always something people looking forward to. We wouldn’t do that to our own. We’re just as shocked as the rest of the world. Our homecoming’s been stained like that.”
She said she is not planning to go to any more homecomings in the Delta.
Everytown for Gun Safety for Gun Safety advocates for evidence-based solutions to end gun violence.
“I shouldn’t have to text my parents to tell them I’m safe every time there’s a shooting near my school,” said Eshah Green-Ortega, a volunteer with the Jackson State chapter of Students Demand Action. “It keeps happening on our campuses, at our celebrations, and in our communities. We deserve to feel safe learning and living our lives, and our lawmakers need to do their jobs and pass the basic gun safety laws that will keep us safe.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker says he’s bringing back a proposal that would require public colleges to conduct a campus safety assessment after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University. 
“Assessments need to be done,” said Rep. Ryan Wilcox, an Ogden Republican and chair of Utah’s school security task force. “Everyone understands that now.”

K-12 schools already must conduct similar reviews under a bigger 2024 school safety law bringing armed guardians into schools and assigning a statewide security chief. In the 2025 Legislature, Wilcox proposed requiring the assessments of colleges, too, but the state Senate rejected that component.
Wilcox told Utah News Dispatch Monday he’s spoken with most of Utah’s college presidents, and many have already ordered security assessments after Kirk’s assassination. But he said a state law is needed to make sure they keep up that scrutiny for years to come.
Wilcox declined to give details on the plan, but he’ll be teaming up with a new higher education task force that’s still being assembled and will focus on campus security.
The reviews are required every three years in Utah’s K-12 system, but Wilcox said he’s not certain whether colleges would follow the same schedule. 
At UVU, Kirk was killed Sept. 10 while answering a question just minutes into his speaking event in a courtyard. The sound of a single shot sent his audience running for cover and triggered a manhunt for the suspected shooter that lasted almost a day and a half. 
The college’s police department came under a microscope in the days that followed. Experts criticized the light security for the event, staffed with six UVU officers, and without assistance from deputies from the Utah County Sheriff’s Office. 
Lawmakers looking to tweak last session’s sweeping school safety bill

Kirk was also scheduled to speak at Utah State University just three three weeks later, and the college held an event with other speakers in Kirk’s place, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. 
For that event, USU asked for help from nearby police departments and other Utah colleges. The University of Utah and Weber State University “were both able to provide some resources to them to help out,” said Keith Squires, chief safety officer at the University of Utah. 
Squires made the comment during a regular meeting of the school safety task force Monday at the state Capitol. The group didn’t talk about UVU’s security plan, but did discuss whether the campus police throughout the states have the resources they need.
In response to a question from Wilcox about whether his department is staffed, Squires said the University of Utah has made changes after Kirk’s shooting. 
“We all know that tragedy strikes, sometimes resources are made available, and the university’s allowed me to be able to put some things in place after assessing needs that I feel very good about,” Squires said, without elaborating. 
Wilcox said colleges should work with the wider community to keep large events safe, but local police departments and sheriffs can only help so much without stretching themselves too thin.
“This is the new reality: We do not have the resources that we need to pull that off consistently,” Wilcox said. “At some point, we’ve got to build that into the structure, into the plan, into the priority list, to make sure that that’s taken care of.”

Gavin Newsom signed.","In summary
Hundreds of California’s incarcerated firefighters will see an increase in pay, a new death benefit and a faster path to expungement of their criminal records under laws Gov. Gavin Newsom signed.


Gov. Gavin Newsom today signed a set of bills meant to recognize incarcerated firefighters, including a historic measure to raise their pay to meet the federal minimum wage during active fires. 
The wage increase, funded through the state budget, follows years of advocacy to improve pay and working conditions for incarcerated labor. That effort took on a new urgency after hundreds of incarcerated firefighters were deployed to battle deadly wildfires that hit Los Angeles in January. 
State lawmakers this year introduced a seven-bill “Firefighting to Freedom” package to protect incarcerated firefighters and support job opportunities upon their reentry. Five of those bills were signed into law today, marking the most comprehensive changes to incarcerated firefighting in the state’s history. 
Incarcerated firefighters previously earned between $5.80 and $10.24 per day, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. During active emergencies, Cal Fire pays them an additional $1 per hour. Now, they will earn $7.25 per hour when they’re on a fire. 
Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Culver City who authored the bill, said Californians should feel proud about the sense of moral clarity that crossed party lines.
“​This is a historic and momentous day,” said Bryan. “​The governor signing the bill is an incredibly powerful reminder that all labor is dignified and anybody who is willing to put their lives on the line deserves our gratitude.”
Bryan initially set out to raise wages for incarcerated firefighters to $19 per hour, but settled on the federal minimum wage after budget negotiations. The bill was opposed by the California State Sheriffs’ Association over concerns of its potential fiscal impact on counties, which administer jails and could also face pressure to increase pay for incarcerated labor. 
It received bipartisan support from nearly two dozen lawmakers. 
“A number of years ago, when I worked for Cal Fire, you have never seen men work harder than with these crews,” said Assemblymember Heath Flora at a legislative hearing in September, a Republican from Ripon who co-authored the bill. “There is not a system — there is not a program — better than the fire camps with Cal Fire and the state of California.”
Bryan introduced the bill after voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have ended forced labor in prisons and jails. It would have amended the state’s constitution to repeal language that allows involuntary servitude as a form of criminal punishment, making work assignments voluntary. 
California’s incarcerated firefighters have long provided critical support to state, local and federal government agencies in responding to various emergencies, including wildfires and floods. They’re voluntary assignments. 
Over 1,800 incarcerated firefighters live year-round in minimum-security conservation camps, also known as “fire camps,” located across 25 counties in California, according to the corrections department. Those numbers have dwindled in recent years due to a declining prison population.

Two of the proposals did not pass, including one that would have required Cal Fire to create more opportunities for incarcerated firefighters to secure firefighting jobs upon their release. The proposal, Assembly Bill 1380, did not reach Newsom. 
That was disappointing to Royal Ramey, a formerly incarcerated firefighter who co-founded the nonprofit organization Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program, which sponsored the measure. But he said the other five bills signed by Newsom are “huge progress.”
“For me, transitioning from fire camp into a career was one of the hardest challenges of my life, and I know too many people who never got that chance,” said Ramey. “With these laws, we can change that story.”
The package of bills Newsom signed included:

Assembly Bill 247: Requires incarcerated firefighters be paid $7.25 per hour while actively fighting a fire.
Assembly Bill 799: Requires the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation pay a death benefit of $50,000 for the death of an incarcerated firefighter.
Assembly Bill 812: Requires the corrections department to create regulations around referring incarcerated firefighters for resentencing.
Assembly Bill 952: Requires the corrections department to establish and expand the Youth Offender Program Camp Pilot Program as a permanent program.
Senate Bill 245: Streamlines and expedites the expungement process for formerly incarcerated firefighters.

“It’s incredibly heartening to see that the Legislature has taken the issue of protecting incarcerated firefighters seriously,” said Taina Angeli Vargas, executive director of the nonprofit organization Initiate Justice Action, which co-sponsored most of the bills. “It’s about time that the state of California began to treat them with more respect and dignity.”
Assemblymember Sade Elhawary, a Democrat from Los Angeles who authored the law to establish and expand the youth pilot program, said it’s an opportunity for the 13 other states that have incarcerated firefighters to “follow in the footsteps of California.”
“I hope this is the beginning of what will be a national movement to elevate the rights and opportunities for incarcerated firefighters,” she said. “All of these folks deserve more love and support.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP_QuailFire_060620_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-13 19:57:50.043053

The Judiciary Committee voted 11-2 in support of the measure, and the issue unified Wyoming Freedom Caucus lawmakers with Republicans not always aligned with them.
The post Panel advances legislation restricting sexual content in Wyoming library books appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming legislative panel on Monday endorsed a bill that would dictate where libraries shelve certain books, lending strong support to a measure that has drawn deep opposition from activists and advocates ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
After repeatedly revising the bill over nearly three hours of discussion, the Joint Judiciary Committee voted 11-2 to sponsor legislation that would allow people to sue public libraries and school districts if they find books containing sexually explicit material — which would be newly defined in Wyoming law under the bill — in areas accessible to minors.
Albany County Republican Sen. Gary Crum did not attend Monday’s meeting and was excused from the vote. Though Crum had expressed skepticism about the bill at a recent community meeting in Laramie, according to The Laramie Reporter, a no vote from him would not have impacted Monday’s result. The bill received an affirmative vote from three of five senators on the committee. Legislation must receive majority support from both the House and Senate sides of the committee to earn an endorsement.
Interest in advancing the legislation unified Wyoming Freedom Caucus members and Republicans on the committee who don’t always align with the caucus. That alignment suggests broad support in the Legislature as a whole. 
“I frankly believe that many of these books are nothing more than pornographic material,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman and Cheyenne Republican Jared Olsen said before the vote. “I can’t understand why … there’s any opposition to moving pornographic material out of the children’s section of our libraries and putting them in adult sections.” 
The vote came just days after a Campbell County librarian who was fired over her opposition to book restrictions announced a $700,000 settlement in a lawsuit she brought against the county, her former employer.
Opponents of the measure — who say lawmakers are making an unprecedented intrusion into public libraries in an attempt to silence LGBTQ authors who write for young people — appear to have a tough job ahead of them if they hope to stop some form of the measure from passing.

“The Wyoming Library Association maintains its position in strong opposition to this bill, even with the amendments passed today, and advocates for its failure,” WLA president Cristine Braddy told WyoFile in a statement. Braddy said the bill remained “a book ban achieved through a decrease in access to materials” by regulating books out of certain areas of libraries. 
“The professional librarians of Wyoming are thoughtful professionals who build appropriate collections for their diverse communities and utilize established, protective policies to safeguard minors,” she continued. “This bill undermines their expertise and limits intellectual freedom.”
Significant changes
Before voting to sponsor the bill for the coming session, the panel amended the legislation heavily. Lawmakers reduced the proposed fine for an institution caught violating the new law drastically — from $50,000 per violation, which librarians said would drive them out of business, to $500. 
They left open mechanisms for people to sue libraries or school districts and collect damages and attorney fees if they find “sexually explicit” material in the children’s sections of libraries, but amended the bill to require those lawsuits to come from people who reside in the county or school district of the institution. 
And, at the behest of Casper Rep. Jayme Lien, a chief proponent of the measure, lawmakers added to the bill a process for library trustees to review materials labeled sexually explicit by their constituents and remove them from their shelves voluntarily. By doing so, libraries could avoid fines or litigation. 
But Laramie Democratic Rep. Ken Chestek, a retired law professor and one of the two “no” votes on the legislation, said the bill still would open the door to activists hunting down a sexual passage, however brief, in books a librarian might have missed and left on the wrong shelf. “It creates a bounty hunting situation,” he said. 
The second no vote came from Sen. Barry Crago, a Republican and attorney from Buffalo. Crago opposed the bill, he said, because he worried the language in it was too broad and would lead to librarians having no choice but to pull contested books from the shelves altogether or face punishment. 
“I don’t like these books either, I would never let my children read them,” he said. “But I can’t vote for the bill.”
But after such substantive amendment work, the committee is likely to pitch the legislation to their colleagues in February as a polished product. Amid the hectic pace of a time-compressed session, that description carries significant weight on the House and Senate floor. 
“A lot of the constituent contact that I’ve had, a lot of those issues, if not all of them frankly, have been addressed by the amendments here today,” Olsen said.
Like Crago and several other lawmakers on the committee, Olsen said he would never let his children read the books in question — which are largely framed around the experience of LGBTQ people, as well as some books describing sexual assaults. 
A ban or something else?
He and other lawmakers pushed back, strenuously at times, on the charge from bill opponents that they’re “banning” books. 
Chestek made that charge when he argued that in many school libraries, there may not be an adult section to move books into. The only solution to avoid punishment would be to remove the books from the library entirely, he said. 
“This is straight up book banning,” Chestek said. “No question about it. Not even debatable.” 
Allegations of book banning were “inflammatory language,” Rep. Tom Kelly, Republican of Sheridan, who voted in favor of the bill, said in response. “That’s absolutely absurd to say that,” Kelly said. “We’re talking about having adult materials be in the adult section, that adults can go get for their kids still if they want to. It’s just not on the shelf so my son goes in there and stumbles across it.”
But opponents of the legislation, which includes the state’s librarians and a number of advocacy organizations, aren’t likely to be swayed by either the amendments or lawmakers’ view of their work. They instead see the legislation as lawmakers exercising the authority over what young Wyomingites can read, and in particular an effort to hide away LGBTQ literature. Some of the books that Olsen described as pornographic material are helpful to gay and lesbian youth who are learning about their sexuality in a conservative state, opponents say. 
“The Freedom Caucus wants to ban books, but not be called book banners,” Sara Burlingame, director of LGBTQ advocacy group Wyoming Equality, told WyoFile in a statement after the vote. “They want to tell Wyoming parents that we can’t be trusted to oversee our children’s books, and we should let them parent our children.” She called for Wyomingites to continue writing to lawmakers to oppose the bill and advocate for librarians’ independence.
“We can’t call ourselves a liberty-loving people and ban books,” she wrote. 
Even with evidence of widespread support among lawmakers, House Judiciary Chairman Art Washut noted that the controversial and complex measure could soak up debate time during the 2026 session. In even years, legislative sessions are designed to craft the state’s two-year budget, and are conducted over just 23 working days. Lawmakers are also facing what is likely to be a complex discussion of public school funding. 
“We’re going to have our hands full,” he said, “but this is a very important topic.”

The federal government announced last week that the U.S. Forest Service approved a mining company’s exploration permit at an old mining site south of Libby.
Idaho-based Hecla Mining Company will spend more than a decade determining whether the “world-class” copper and silver deposit presents a viable opportunity for future mining.
“We are pleased to see the U.S. Forest Service advance the Libby Project, and we are grateful the FAST-41 process helped move this important project forward efficiently,” Rob Krcmarov, President and CEO of Hecla said in a press release. “This approval represents years of collaboration among federal agencies, local and state officials and other stakeholders. The Libby Project exemplifies our commitment to responsibly developing critical minerals in the United States, delivering long-term economic benefits to our communities, and maintaining rigorous environmental stewardship.”
Hecla said that the Libby Project, formerly known as the Montanore Mine, contains potentially 1.5 billion pounds of copper and 183 million ounces of silver.
Mike Satre, Hecla’s director of governmental affairs, said in an email to the Daily Montanan that the next steps of the exploration project will include dewatering and rehabilitation of approximately 7,000 feet of the existing Libby Adit, or mine shaft, followed by extending the adit nearly a mile.
The project’s operational documents indicate that an additional 6,300 feet of lateral shafts would be constructed above the mineral deposits, and mineral exploration would take place from approximately 25 underground drill stations.
Satre told the Daily Montanan Monday that Hecla is in the process of obtaining a new water discharge permit, expected in 2026, from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to support additional exploration and development activities. The dewatering and rehabilitation of the existing adit can proceed, he added.
But the project has long drawn criticism from conservation groups concerned over potential impacts to groundwater, a nearby wilderness area and protected species, such as grizzly bears.
Several comments submitted to the Forest Service on the draft decision earlier this year emphasized problems with increased traffic and construction noise, as well as perceived flaws with the department’s environmental analysis, especially given the mining operation will stretch beneath the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness.
Ben Catton, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, said earlier this year that Hecla’s push for the small exploration project is “an obvious attempt to be given an inch in order to take a mile.”
“The Libby Exploration Project is still massive in ecological impact,” Catton wrote. “…The documents downplay impacts or offer unclear plans for mitigating said impacts, ranging from the potential for dewatering of streams, increasing stream water temperatures, surface subsidences, and geochemical leaching.”
MEIC was part of a previous lawsuit related to exploration at the Libby site. The suit against Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality focused on a former Hecla CEO, designated a “bad actor,” for leaving millions of dollars in reclamation and water treatment obligations while at a previous company.
Baker left Hecla in May 2024, and Krcmarov was appointed in November 2024, and the lawsuit was dismissed.
Members of Montana’s congressional delegation lauded the approval of the exploration permit.
“The Libby Exploration Project will provide good-paying Montana mining jobs without harming our beautiful lands and will help unlock the high value of world class copper and silver. President Trump’s administration has proven yet again that they are committed to protecting Made-In-Montana energy and supporting Montana miners,” Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines said in a statement. “I look forward to seeing the positive impacts this project will have on our state and our nation as we continue to unlock America’s full mining potential.”
The exploration process is expected to take 16 years, after which the project “would be closed and reclaimed over a three-year period,” according to Satre.
“Any future decision on the viability of a mine will be wholly dependent on the collection of data from the exploration drilling and it is unknown how long the assessment of that data will take,” Satre said. “If Hecla decides to proceed in the future, it will require submission of a new plan of operations to the U.S. Forest Service and will initiate a public permitting process.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-490647442-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 19:57:50.043053

Entirely managed by an all-volunteer nonprofit group, the project still faces a $300,000 shortfall but is slated to be completed by summer 2026.

For years, nearly every event at the historic Vergennes Opera House has seen attendees with accessibility needs either turned away or a struggle up the stairs or to the auditorium, longtime volunteers said.
Come summer of 2026, that issue will be history, thanks to the efforts of a nonprofit residents group managing the building. Construction is underway for a $2.2 million All Access Project that will make the building ADA accessible. 
The project has been long overdue, according to Gerianne Smart, president of the Friends of the Vergennes Opera House, a nonprofit created in 1993 that reopened the theater in 1997, an achievement celebrated with a sold-out Vermont Symphony Orchestra performance, according to its website.
The building was brought up to fire code in the 1990s and has since seen several small improvements.
“It’s an old building, so it’s always begging for a little something,” Smart said. “The one thing that was left was accessibility.”
The project to make the Vergennes Opera House accessible started this summer and is expected to be completed by April 2026. Photo courtesy of the Friends of the Opera House
The project involves building a new elevator tower against the southwest side of the building, a better walkway from the street, and an interior lift from the auditorium level to both the stage and dressing room, which will also include an accessible restroom.
Set in downtown Vergennes — at around 2,500 people, the smallest city in Vermont — the red brick building houses the city offices on the first floor and an auditorium with a painted backdrop on the second that has long been a community hub for public and private gatherings, from musical shows to the annual town meeting.
Working on the accessibility project has made Smart keenly aware of the struggles people with mobility issues face in everyday life. They shouldn’t face barriers to accessing the opera house and city offices, she said.
“It hurts my heart even talking out loud about it,” Smart said. “I can’t believe we’ve denied people access to their own town hall for so long.”
It’s remarkable, said City Manager Ron Redmond, that the Friends have managed to raise most of the money and manage a project that will benefit everyone.
“They operate with such intention,” he said. “I’ve never seen a group of volunteers be so active, so good at management, so good at fundraising.”
And thanks to the Friends group, more residents and visitors will be able to access the space, said Redmond, who anticipates the opera house will be used a lot more. 
“It’s exciting and it’s amazing,” he said.

A grand tradition
Built in 1857 for $12,000, the building has hosted debates, political rallies, weddings, graduations, town meetings, music and theater performances, and notable people such as President William Howard Taft and Tiny Tim, according to the website.
It was also where a company founded by Thomas Edison first showed moving pictures in Addison County in 1901.
By 1970, the building was rundown and closed until the Friends formed to help restore and reopen it. The leader of the effort was local resident Garry Simpson, a writer, director, producer and three-time Emmy award winner. He died in 2011 but many in town still speak glowingly of his effort to revive the building and the arts.
While project construction has temporarily closed the community space — but not the municipal offices — the Friends have moved productions to off-stage locations around the city for the 2025-26 season.
The accessibility project began in 2021 when the Friends first put out a request for proposals for architects, according to Smart. The all-volunteer group raised funds through state grants and charitable donations, but the project still faces a $300,000 shortfall. To help close the gap, the Friends have launched a buy-a-brick campaign that’s seen some creative results, according to Suzanne Rood, one of the board members.
There are quotes from Shakespeare like “To thine own self be true,” some Bible verses, and some honoring veterans. One reads “The answer to the universe is on the back,” Rood said with a laugh.
The Friends have sold about 250 bricks so far, but there’s space for 500 in the new well-lit, pedestrian courtyard in the alleyway between the Vergennes Opera House and St. Paul’s Church next door. The courtyard will provide easy access to the new elevator tower being built.
Rood is a pianist who directs the Addison County Gospel Choir and has performed at the opera house. She uses a wheelchair and is particularly pleased there will be “a discreet lift” backstage to help access the stage.
“I think it shows that the Vergennes community values including people with mobility issues and is willing to do such an enormous project in order to be inclusive,” she said.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Des Moines Area Community College’s board of trustees voted unanimously Monday to extend its presidential search and initiate a new search for an interim president.
The community college was forced to rethink its timeline for selecting a new president after two of the three finalists, set to come to campus in October for more interviews, withdrew their names from consideration last week for personal reasons. President Rob Denson will conclude his more-than-20-year career at DMACC Dec. 31.
“The process will work,” DMACC Board President Kevin Halterman said. “We will find someone.”

Presidential search committee members met with search consultant Larry Ebbers in a special meeting Friday to discuss how to move forward with the search, though no decisions were made without full board approval.
Ebbers, during Monday’s meeting, proposed an extended timeline that would have an interim leader selected this fall and a new president coming to campus to stay this summer.
Where previously the college planned to welcome a new president to campus immediately after Denson’s retirement, the new plan has candidates being interviewed in late February and early March with the goal of selecting someone in time for a July 1 start date.
While previous candidates are allowed to reapply to the position, Ebbers said, they won’t revisit the pool compiled by the previous search. The third candidate from the first round of finalists is interested in staying in the running, Ebbers said Friday.
Amanda Easton, DMACC executive director of human resources, said during the meeting the college has a “practice” that requires at least three finalists for executive-level positions.
The remainder of 2025 will be spent identifying someone to serve as interim president for the first half of 2026, with Ebbers previously saying he already knows of parties interested in the role. This will be a “targeted search,” he said Monday, rather than a search that is advertised nationally.
Once selected, the interim president will serve Jan. 1-June 30, 2026.
The first search drew in more than 50 candidates from nearly every U.S. state, Ebbers said. It was made clear through the initial search process that DMACC wants someone with community college experience, preferably of the presidential variety.
Halterman said during the meeting DMACC is a large enough institution to need a leader who knows what it’s like to serve at a community college.
“DMACC is not a training ground,” Halterman said.

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline) North Carolina state and local leaders gathered Monday at Oak Grove Elementary School in Raleigh to call on the General Assembly to fund the state’s Farm to School program, warning that federal cuts could threaten student nutrition and local farmers.
The event, held during National School Lunch Week and Farm to School Month, featured state Sen. Jay Chaudhuri (D-Wake) and other speakers, including Wake County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Taylor.
Chaudhuri called on the General Assembly to provide $2.5 million for the Farm to School program and $1.9 million for the Sun Bucks summer food program to replace part of the $12.5 million eliminated by the Trump administration.
“We legislators in North Carolina must decide how we are going to respond and what we are going to prioritize, and I can’t think of any more deserving of our support than putting fresh North Carolina-grown foods on the plates of North Carolina students,” said Chaudhuri.
The Farm to School program, run by the N.C. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Public Instruction, connects more than 80 school districts with local farmers, delivering over 75,000 cases of North Carolina-grown fruits and vegetables each year.
Wake County Public Schools is one of many districts benefiting from the program. Superintendent Taylor said the requested funding would not only expand healthy meals for students but also ease the financial strain on families.
“When we have these kinds of programs that can relieve that amount of pressure on the family budget,” Taylor said, “it is a very small investment that will impact economic development.”
Taylor said the program has expanded from 12 to 41 schools that are taking part in the Community Eligibility Program, which provides free meals to students. “A 10 percent reduction in federal funding could wipe out meal programs in 33 schools,” he warned.
The Farm to School program was also intended to benefit local farmers by giving them a reliable market for their produce.
“What makes our Farm to School program so unique is that 100% of every dollar we spend goes towards supporting the schools, the farms, and the communities,” said Tommy Wheeler, founder of Tidewater Grain Company in Pamlico County.
“It’s much of an economic development program as it is an assistance program for our kids and our future youth,” added Wheeler, who sells his rice to school districts including Wake County Public School System.
According to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, one in six children in the state faces food insecurity, about 394,000 children statewide.
Rachel Candaso, the 2025 NC Teacher of the Year, is an educator in Pitt County. She said she sees the impact of school nutrition programs firsthand in her classroom. “We know that a hungry student can’t focus on equations or essays when they’re hungry for food. The fresh, healthy food that we provide students at school, it helps them be ready to learn,” said Candaso.
Chaudhuri said he anticipates bipartisan support, describing the request as “narrow and reasonable,” and centered on helping children and strengthening local economies.
“I’m trying to stay optimistic that the leadership in both chambers will see the benefit of doing so,” Chaudhuri said.
Although the funding is contained in the House budget, the Senate’s spending plan does not include the money.

A Senate committee advanced a bill that would ban gender transition surgery, hormone therapy and puberty-blocking drugs for minors Thursday. (Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A group of adults, children and their parents dropped a case challenging a South Carolina law that bars all gender transition treatments for youth and prevents state-funded health plans from covering procedures for adults.
Last week’s decision by attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union ended a lawsuit filed in August 2024.
It argued a law signed three months earlier violated transgender South Carolinians’ constitutional right to equal protection by denying them the same access to health care as peers whose hormones and surgeries are covered.
“This was a heartbreaking decision, and the legal team remains committed to the rights of transgender and non-binary South Carolinians and their access to gender affirming medical care,” ACLU spokesperson Paul Bowers said in a statement, declining to elaborate further on why the attorneys made the decision.
Last year’s debate in the Statehouse focused on stopping puberty blockers and other hormone therapy for minors, but the law ultimately limited options even for adults with private insurance.
That’s due to a line in the law that bans public funds from paying “directly or indirectly for gender transition procedures.” Since the Medical University of South Carolina receives state funds, it stopped offering all treatments regardless of a patient’s age or health plan.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on transgender medical care for minors

The ACLU’s decision follows actions by the U.S. Supreme Court.
In June, justices upheld a similar law in Tennessee that bans gender transition treatments for transgender youth. At the time, ACLU attorneys said that 6-3 ruling would not end their fight against South Carolina’s law.
They argued Tennessee’s law was narrower because it didn’t impact transgender adults. According to GOP sponsors of South Carolina’s law, the line on public funds was meant to block coverage by Medicaid and the state health plan for government employees, though MUSC’s decision affected adults statewide.
Then in late June, justices asked the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision requiring government-funded health plans in North Carolina and West Virginia to cover transgender treatments and surgeries.
Specifically, the lower court’s ruling applied to North Carolina’s state health insurance plan and West Virginia’s Medicaid program.
Because of the similarity between those cases and the South Carolina lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel put the Palmetto State case on pause until the appeals court issued a new decision considering the precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court’s Tennessee ruling.
As of Monday, the lower court had yet to do so.
But the ACLU attorneys opted not to wait any longer. They reversed course and informed Gergel in a one-sentence filing that the plaintiffs wanted to dismiss the lawsuit.
The office of Attorney General Alan Wilson contends the ACLU’s attorneys recognized they would ultimately lose.
Lawsuit seeks to block South Carolina law limiting transgender medical care options

The Supreme Court ruling made it clear that the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause doesn’t extend to gender transition treatments for transgender people, the office wrote in legal filings.
Because of that, South Carolina is allowed to draw the line as to what gender transition treatments it will or won’t cover without court interference, the office argued.
“I am proud to aggressively defend South Carolina’s law and will continue to do so if necessary,” Wilson said in a statement Monday.
Senate Medical Affairs Chairman Danny Verdin, who sponsored the Senate’s version of the bill that became law, said he was glad to see the lawsuit dropped.
“The ACLU would be wise to stop pushing taxpayer-funded gender transitions for children, but if they don’t, South Carolina stands ready to fight for truth and common sense,” the Laurens Republican said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_7613-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 18:57:21.812146

(Screenshot via Brown University press call)Peter Howitt was shocked, a little confused, and had no celebratory champagne in his fridge when he found out Monday morning he had won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. 
The retired Brown University professor’s phone was off, its battery depleted overnight. Only through an enterprising Swedish journalist who obtained Howitt’s wife’s number did the Canada-born economist learn of Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences’ decision to award him half a Nobel for his work with French economist Philippe Aghion.
“At first I thought, ‘This is some kind of a hoax,’ but after I asked her a few questions, it became clear that this was for real,” said Howitt, 79, who taught at Brown from 2000 through 2013, after which he gained emeritus status. “It was only about, oh, perhaps three quarters of an hour later that the Swedish Academy managed to get through to me.”
The Ivy League university shared the story over a Zoom press call early Monday afternoon with Howitt and Brown leadership. Howitt fielded questions from reporters in places as diverse as South Korea, Canada and Rhode Island about his work in what the Swedish Academy labeled “the theory of sustained growth through creative destruction.” 
The other half of this year’s Nobel in economic theory will go to Joel Mokyr of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who has worked on related ideas in theories of economic growth. The prizes are scheduled to be awarded during a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. 
Howitt shares his victory with Aghion, who teaches at the Collège de France, INSEAD and the London School of Economics. In 1992, Aghion and Howitt co-authored a new model of creative destruction, a concept introduced by Joseph Schumpeter in his 1942 book, “Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy.” The Austrian economist’s tome joins the likes of Karl Marx’s “Capital” and Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations” as among the most cited books in the social sciences published before 1950.
Howitt summarized Schumpeter’s “simple idea” for reporters: “In order to understand technological progress, you have to understand that it takes place through waves of innovation that bring great benefits … but also generate tremendous losses to many people whose technology, whose livelihood depends upon technologies and capital that are rendered obsolete by these new technologies,” Howitt said.
Howitt and Aghion dealt with the phenomenon in a new way by creating a mathematically coherent model, which the economist said allowed for more empirical analysis of the way progress and stagnation work in economic growth and industry.
‘Escape-competition effect’
Howitt and Aghion zeroed in on how previous innovators can then delay future improvements to maintain their position on top. 
“I’m thrilled that the world at large is beginning to acknowledge the importance of that conflict,” Howitt said. “The central thing that we focus on is that new technologies are brought in by disruptive outsiders who are interested in shaking up the status quo. If they succeed in doing that, they become the status quo.”
Schumpeter’s application of the theory was gentler on monopolies, Howitt noted, while he and Aghion prefer the “escape-competition effect,” which details how existing industry leaders in some spaces often “find it easier to suppress competition and to escape competition.” 
That’s why innovation needs “not to be blocked by the people who used to be innovators, but are now quite reactionary,” Howitt said. “This requires a lot of attention, by antitrust policy, by competition policy, by international trade policy.”  
Howitt and Aghion’s 1992 paper has been cited by 4,421 subsequent papers, according to the database EconPapers. But there was a time when Howitt was unsure whether the paper would get published at all, he said, despite Aghion’s constant encouragement that the duo might win a Nobel some day.  
“It took us five years to get it published,” Howitt said. “It just did not meet with a good reception.”
Howitt and Aghion’s research remains a hotly discussed staple of economics theory, with entire volumes devoted to examining the theory’s viability. The National Bureau of Economic Research produced a working paper in 2017, for example, that argued existing firms’ improvements to their product lines were more important for economic growth than true creative destruction. 


 A dyed in the wool economist 
Asked by reporters about AI, Howitt did not take a Chicken Little stance.
“The fact is that throughout history, there have been all sorts of great general purpose technologies that have come about which people have predicted are going to generate mass unemployment, and that’s the sort of the end of the ability of anyone to earn a living through their work,” Howitt said. “But it hasn’t happened. Mass unemployment is always predicted for new technologies, and typically it doesn’t happen.”
That’s because new technologies make workers “more productive,” Howitt said, and it’s not usual for economic growth, technological change, and the value of labor to proceed in totally opposite directions.
But, Howitt added, “It’s going to have to be regulated…Private incentives in an unregulated market are not really going to resolve this conflict in a way that’s best for society.”
Howitt said his interest in economics began when he was a teenager working for a wool importer in his hometown of Guelph, Ontario, which sold wares to textile mills in the province as well as Quebec. Howitt recalled his fascination with the business’ teletype terminal that hummed throughout the workday, “bringing in prices of wool from around the world.”  










Mass unemployment is always predicted for new technologies, and typically it doesn’t happen. 


– Brown University Professor Emeritus Peter Howitt


Howitt’s boss, who the economist described as “a real mentor,” told the young man he’d have to study economics if he wanted to understand why the prices of different kinds of wool shot up and down over the course of a day.  
“He started to explain something about supply and demand to me, and that sounded really interesting,” Howitt said, who went on to study economics and political science at McGill University in Montreal. As an undergraduate and then graduate student, Howitt acquired a taste for macroeconomics, and his doctoral thesis at Northwestern University focused on the appropriately macro theme of monetary dynamics.    
“But I never turned back from that original question that I made of my boss back when I was about 18 years old, ‘Why are these prices going up and down?’” Howitt added.
Cass Cliatt, Brown’s senior vice president for communications who emceed the press event, closed by congratulating Howitt and added, “We hope you do find that champagne.” 
“My wife just got back from the store,” Howitt replied, “so she’s got something.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFormer Democratic state representative turned Trump supporter Vernon Jones has launched a bid for Georgia’s secretary of state.
Jones is the fourth Republican candidate to declare a run to be the state’s top election official, joining state Rep. Tim Fleming; Kelvin King, a former candidate for U.S. Senate; and former state elections official Gabriel Sterling. A primary will be held in May 2026.
In his campaign announcement, Jones positioned himself as someone who is capable of “restoring faith in democracy,” arguing elections have been “shaken” for too long.
“We need a Secretary of State who will fight for paper ballots, limit mail-in voting, and enforce strong voter ID laws, because election integrity starts with common sense,” Jones said in his announcement video.
The Georgia Secretary of State oversees elections, grants business licenses and manages the state’s securities market. The office, currently held by Brad Raffensperger, gained attention after the 2020 election when Raffensperger, a Republican, refused to overturn the results despite pressure from President Donald Trump during his first run for a second term.
Jones touted his alliance with Trump in his Monday announcement, saying that he’ll stand “shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump in the fight for election integrity.” Jones said in a press release that he’ll “make Georgia the model for American First election integrity” as he campaigns across the state.
“I never wavered, and I never will. My loyalty is to the people of Georgia and to President Trump’s America First movement,” Jones said in a press release.
Jones stepped into the national spotlight in 2020 as an outspoken supporter of Trump, snagging a speaker slot at that year’s Republican National Convention. And the lifelong Democrat became a Republican darling among the Trump faithful after the former president demanded Gov. Brian Kemp resign for refusing to overturn his narrow 2020 Georgia election loss to President Joe Biden.
Jones launched a short-lived campaign for governor in 2022 before jumping in the race for Georgia’s 10th Congressional District with Trump’s endorsement. Jones finished second, losing to now-Congressman Mike Collins. 
As CEO of DeKalb County, Jones faced allegations of misconduct toward women. 
Penny Brown Reynolds, an ex-Biden administration appointee and former Fulton County state judge, and voting rights advocate Adrian Consonery Jr. are running for the Democratic ticket.

The New Mexico Finance Authority approved more than $50 million in housing loans for developers, the executive director said recently. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The leader of the New Mexico Finance Authority on Friday said the authority has already approved more than one-third of $125 million in housing-related loans, which were a key part of the Legislature’s “historic” housing spending in 2024.
NMFA CEO Marquita Russel provided an update on the status of the authority’s loan fund Friday during a presentation to an interim legislative committee. Lawmakers in 2024 approved nearly $200 million in new housing-related spending, citing a growing shortage and homelessness crisis.
The Legislature made a change during the authority’s Opportunity Enterprise Revolving Loan Fund, allowing the authority to award housing loans, and it gave the authority $125 million to loan out. 
The fund offers low-interest loans to help developers break ground on either middle-income housing projects, which Russel referred to as “workforce housing,” or affordable housing infrastructure, including water, electrical or other utilities. 
Legislature and governor tout ‘largest one-time investment in housing’ during 2024 session 

Its first round of funding began in September 2024. Since then, the authority has approved about $52 million in two rounds of funding, and it has set aside about $50 million for a third round. 
“So there’s not a lot available for round four. It depends largely on how round three pencils out,” she said.
The funding has gone to projects in Bernalillo, Doña Ana, Otero, Santa Fe, Taos and Valencia counties, she told lawmakers. 
Among the “workforce housing” projects she described are townhomes in Taos, the Santa Fe Midtown project and military housing in Alamogordo.
As for affordable housing infrastructure, she listed the San Roque and San Mateo Manor apartment projects in Albuquerque, among others. 
In total, statewide developers asked for nearly $200 million in loans across three rounds, she said. The authority can offer loans up to $15 million per recipient at 60% of the current Wall Street Journal prime rate, which means about 4.35%, as of Monday.
In addition to the loans, the Legislature in 2024 approved $20 million on homelessness initiatives and $50 million for the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority, which recently rebranded as Housing New Mexico.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9539-1024x964.jpg,,,2025-10-13 18:57:21.812146

Terry Rogers and Rick Jasperse on March 20, 2014. Photo via Georgia House Media ServicesColleagues of state Rep. Mandi Ballinger say they’ll remember her as a woman with a heart for Georgia’s children, a mind for parsing intricate laws and the guts to stand up for what she believed in.
Ballinger, a Canton Republican, died Sunday after a long battle with cancer, according to an announcement from House Speaker Jon Burns.
Before she was elected to the state House in 2012, Ballinger started her career working in a domestic violence shelter and went on to work for a district attorney’s office as a victim advocate.
State leaders said she brought her passion for serving the vulnerable to the state Capitol.
“Representative Ballinger’s highest priority as a legislator was helping Georgia’s young people affected by our state juvenile justice system,” said House Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones, a Milton Republican, in a text. “Her serious, steely manner masked a soft and caring heart. These qualities made her a formidable force when she felt legislators or advocates crossed her high standards in her committee.”
“Personally, she was my friend and a devoted mother to her son, Henry,” Jones added. “He was her light while she made Georgia a brighter place for our children.”
Ballinger was chair of the House Judiciary Juvenile Committee. Jasper Republican state Rep. Rick Jasperse, who shared an office with Ballinger at the Capitol, said she had a rare combination of passion for the subject matter and the intellect to craft legislation.
“The legal world around children is pretty darn complex,” Jasperse said. “We’d be in our office some evenings, and she’s trying to explain some complex matter about this legal thing, and much of the time my eyes were rolled back in my head, but she knew it, and she knew the outcome that she wanted to make. When she brought a bill to the House floor, she didn’t have to do a whole lot of explaining, because people trusted her. She had already done her explaining in the committees and to people that needed to know, and people trusted her that she was going to do the right thing.”
Ballinger’s idea of the right thing sometimes put her at odds with other conservatives. That includes her support for a bill to divert some 17-year-olds accused of crimes from state superior court to juvenile court, which she championed for years but didn’t get passed into law.
Jasperse said Ballinger didn’t shy away from speaking her mind, and he’ll miss the spirited debates Ballinger had with him and others in their office suite.
“In our world, we had been there a while, and so we like really getting into subjects and learning about them and debating them, especially in small office situations – why you’re right, why you’re wrong – it’s entertaining,” he said. “She was really good at debate because she understood her stuff so well.”
In addition to her work for children and crime victims, Ballinger was an ardent backer of gun rights. She was lead sponsor of a 2022 bill signed by Gov. Brian Kemp that expanded firearm license reciprocity and allowed people with permits from other states to carry legally in Georgia.
Ballinger put her debate skills to use in committee meeting rooms, said Concord Republican state Rep. Beth Camp.
“She was a master at holding a committee meeting,” Camp said. “She understood parliamentary procedure and she was such a wonderful teacher on how to run a committee meeting where it was productive and people were still able to speak and all voices could be heard.”
Camp, who was elected in 2020, said she and other women legislators saw Ballinger as a mentor, a role she was happy to fill.
“There’s not a lot of other women that serve in the General Assembly, especially Republican women,” Camp said. “She was willing to take the time, and she took a genuine interest in me, and I appreciated that so much.”
“She was so wonderful to many people, and she never sought the spotlight,” she added. “That just was never her style, but she always wanted to let people know that they had a support system and if she liked you, she would fight for you, and so I was very honored that she fought for me.”
Camp said she is inspired by Ballinger’s commitment to public service, even while she was suffering health challenges.
“Even though she’d been battling cancer ever since I knew her, that was not the definition of who she was,” Camp said. “She was a mother, fearlessly loving Henry, her son, and she kept going. A lot of people would have stepped back some, but not her. She was elected by the people in her district. She continued to fight for them and to fight for the people of Georgia to the end. To the very end.”

California-based Radiant Industries cited the state's ban on spent nuclear fuel waste and said it will build a manufacturing plant in Tennessee.
The post Radiant scraps Wyoming nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility appeared first on WyoFile .","Radiant Industries has scrapped its proposal to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility outside the Natrona County town of Bar Nunn and announced it plans to build “its first mass-produced Kaleidos microreactor” facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, “on a Manhattan Project site.”
The announcement came Monday afternoon in the form of a letter-to-the-editor from Radiant Senior Director of Operations Matt Wilson and a press release announcing the company’s new focus on building the facility in Tennessee. The company cited Wyoming’s decades-long ban on storing spent nuclear fuel waste.
“Our decision came down to regulatory certainty,” Wilson said. “Our plan was to build our nuclear generators in the Cowboy State, using Wyoming-mined uranium, send them to customers (like our troops at remote bases), and bring them back for refueling, with the used fuel being safely and temporarily stored in above-ground containers at our factory.”
Wyoming lawmakers made a narrow exception to the state ban in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.

Nuclear energy supporters have backed, without success, several proposals in recent years to make more exceptions to accommodate other nuclear waste storage proposals, such as Radiant’s. A legislative committee tabled such a measure in July.
“Radiant was only seeking to safely and temporarily store used fuel from Wyoming-built reactors returned from deployment,” Wilson wrote. “Sadly, Wyoming’s law currently does not accommodate that model.”
California-based Radiant also faced significant opposition within Bar Nunn and beyond, mostly due to its plan to store spent nuclear fuel at the manufacturing facility — which would have been located close to Casper, Wyoming’s second-largest city. Though the company found many supporters, as well as many others who were on the fence seeking details and assurances regarding safety, a group formed to oppose Radiant’s Bar Nunn proposal and began collecting signatures. 
“Bar Nunn does not want nuclear waste,” Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand told a crowd of about 200 in July during a meeting he organized in Bar Nunn. “We want manufacturing. We would love for Radiant to come here and manufacture and put the waste somewhere else.”

Retired Wyoming uranium miner Wayne Heili, who recently held a “nuclear 101” presentation at Casper College and generally supports nuclear energy proposals in the state, told WyoFile he is disappointed. 
The Legislature’s Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee, he said, “had an opportunity earlier this year to move something forward, and they didn’t. That left Radiant looking at uncertainty.
“It’s a sad outcome for business development in Wyoming,” Heili added. “That’s the legacy of nuclear, though. No matter where you are, somebody’s going to show some concern.”
Green River Republican Sen. Scott Heiner, who co-chairs the Interim Minerals Committee, said Radiant pressured lawmakers to move too quickly to change state law to accommodate its plans, noting that most lawmakers only learned of the company’s proposal earlier this year.
“They’ve made their decision before we’ve had a chance to go through the whole legislative cycle,” Heiner told WyoFile on Monday. “We took public testimony, we tabled the decision until later, and they’ve decided to go.”
Heiner added, “They’ve held that over our head for the whole time: ‘If you don’t approve this, then we’re going to go to Tennessee.’ Well, something that huge, you don’t rush it.”

Rod Blum announced Monday he is suspending his campaign for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
“It has become clear to me that I can help President Trump in other ways that are more effective than being in the U.S. House,” Blum said in a news release. “I love our country, and despite our challenges I remain optimistic that under the President’s leadership, America’s best days are still to come.”
Blum, a 70-year-old Dubuque resident, had launched his campaign Sept. 18. The former CEO and president of Eagle Point Software previously served in Congress representing northeast Iowa from his initial 2014 election until he lost to former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat, in the 2018 midterm election.
Seeking a return to Washington, D.C., Blum announced he would support his campaign with a personal $250,000 investment. He was running for the seat currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who in turn is running for the U.S. Senate. Incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst announced she will not seek reelection in 2026.
There are several other Republicans still in the race to become the GOP candidate in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District. Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta; state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, and former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell all also announced their campaigns for the nomination in September.
Three Democrats are also running for the seat: Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque; Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25, and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
Political forecasters predict the 2026 race for the 2nd Congressional District is likely to be less competitive than other Iowa races. But following Hinson’s announcement that she would leave the race, Cook Political Report shifted the rating for the seat from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican” in 2026.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A pair of reproductive-related bills have been filed in the Florida Legislature in advance of the 2026 legislative session that starts Jan. 13.
One proposal, filed by Vero Beach Republican Sen. Erin Grall, would let parents file wrongful-death lawsuits for the death of a fetus at any stage of development.
As of this publication, Grall’s bill, SB 164 lacked a House companion.

SB 164 would not allow civil suits to be brought against medical personnel providing assistive reproductive technology, or procedures that involve the handling of human eggs, sperm, and embryos to help achieve pregnancy.
Neither could lawsuits be filed against a patient seeking reproductive assistance.
Grall filed similar legislation last year but that bill faced opposition from powerful Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, the former Senate president and chair of the Rules Committee. Passidomo took issue with the bill’s definition of “unborn child” as a “member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”
The 2026 version of the bill uses the same definition of unborn child.
Senate Republicans criticize bill establishing wrongful death of fetuses

The second proposal, HB 6001, was filed by Boca Raton House Democrat Kelly Skidmore. That bill would eliminate from statute the “Florida Pregnancy Support Services Program,” established in 2005 as an initiative of then-Gov. Jeb Bush with the Legislature agreeing to appropriate $2 million for its operations. 
In 2018, the Legislature codified the program into statute passing HB 41.
Now the program is housed in the Department of Health and legislators have agreed in the current year state budget to allocate $29.5 million to help it operate.
Skidmore argues that the program is no longer needed because of the state’s six-week abortion ban which, for the most part, bans terminations before many patients know they are pregnant.

“When we live in a state that has a six-week ban, how many crisis pregnancies do you think there are that we still need to fund $29.5 million for these centers?” Skidmore asked. “What crisis pregnancies are they helping with? There aren’t any, because there are no options for pregnant women. So, this is just false. All of it is false and a misuse of taxpayer dollars.”
HB 6001 doesn’t have a Senate companion because it is a “repealer bill.” Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez implemented a rule allowing representatives to file one repealer bill per session that does not count toward their seven-bill limit.
Skidmore said she took advantage of the opportunity.
“And what surprises me is that the emphasis on the new DOGE office has not raised this as a red flag of inappropriate spending of taxpayer dollars, particularly since there was a recent news story that the lawyer that represents many of these networks gave advice to not provide ultrasounds to pregnant women suspected of having an ectopic pregnancy because it was a high risk of being sued,” Skidmore said, referencing a Massachusetts lawsuit.
Meanwhile, the most recent available data show that during state fiscal year 2022-23, 21,372 women were provided 132,395 counseling services and 18,238 pregnancy tests were provided by the centers.

In 2022, New Mexico voters overwhelmingly affirmed this mission by passing a constitutional amendment for early childhood funding. Now, we’re setting our sights even higher. Because of over a decade of advocacy from families, organizers, educators, and community leaders, with bold leadership from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the state Legislature, we’ll be the first state in the nation to offer free child care to all families, regardless of income.
This proposal will bring generational economic relief to thousands of New Mexico families and improve wages for our early childhood educators, who are the backbone of our state’s child care system. Bold investments in our families and children pay back dividends, but it’s important we iron out the details with input from providers, educators, families, and our communities.
We commend the Early Childhood Education and Care Department (ECECD) for proposing increased reimbursement rates for providers that pay their workers a more livable wage. This is a values-driven use of our state budget during a time when federal support programs for families and children are under attack, but it’s only a temporary fix.
In partnership with stakeholders from across the state, the ECECD developed a comprehensive wage and career ladder, which establishes a robust wage scale that increases early childhood workers’ wages based on their level of experience and education. This plan will ensure our state retains and attracts more high-quality workers and meets the current and future needs of New Mexico’s families and children. The best part is, it already has the support of child care business owners, workers, and advocates.
A recent child care gap analysis found a shortfall of almost 14,000 child care slots in 2024, with the most significant gaps in Lea, Eddy, Santa Fe, Sandoval and Bernalillo counties. In November, as free child care eligibility expands, we can expect to see the demand for slots rise even more. The ECECD’s strategy to increase supply through home-based providers and incentivizing higher wages is the right way to go. A comprehensive wage and career ladder will ensure that those gains can be retained and grow in the future.
While New Mexico builds out child care capacity, we must also make sure that our families with the greatest need come first. When free child care was expanded to include New Mexico families at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, there were fewer child care slots utilized by those with the lowest household income. When the state removes income requirements next month, it must keep a close eye on enrollment data so that those with the most need are not left behind.
To ensure quality care for all families, the providers who make it possible must have the resources and support to provide safe and healthy environments, along with competitive wages to attract and keep skilled educators. We strongly support the ECECD’s strategy for recruiting and supporting smaller, home-based providers. This will be especially critical in rural and tribal communities, where they are often the backbone of care.
Our vision in New Mexico is clear: universal, affordable, high-quality child care for all families; well-paid educators; and a system grounded in equity and justice. Now, we all have a role to play in making sure the system delivers on its promise for families, providers, and most of all, for our children.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/242533085_187573036792822_256662930739931601_n-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 17:58:38.001534

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A proposed electric rate increase would cost North Dakota State University about $1 million a year, a representative of the college told utility regulators Monday. 
Northern States Power Co., part of Xcel Energy, has asked the North Dakota Public Service Commission to approve a rate increase of more than 19%, or $22.34 per month for an average residential customer. 
Xcel Energy’s requested rate increase would affect parts of Fargo, including the NDSU campus.
“NDSU projects that our annual electrical costs would rise by over $1 million,” Brent DeKrey, director of facilities management at NDSU, testified from Fargo at a PSC hearing Monday. 
DeKrey said such a large increase could mean increased tuition and fees for students, reduced resources for research at NDSU and additional costs passed along to the state’s taxpayers. 
Minnesota-based Xcel has about 97,000 customers in North Dakota. The proposed rate hike would increase Xcel’s annual revenue in the state by $44.6 million. 
The PSC also took testimony from people in Grand Forks and Minot, which are also served by Xcel, as well as from the Capitol in Bismarck. 
Xcel’s coal exit an issue in North Dakota electric rate case 

A point of discussion in the rate case is Xcel’s move away from coal to generate electricity. 
Xcel last year retired one of three coal units at the Sherburne County Generating Plant, or Sherco, near Monticello, Minnesota. It plans to retire Sherco’s remaining coal-fired units in 2026 and 2030, marking the company’s full exit from coal. Xcel has invested in solar and wind energy and continues to rely on nuclear power plants.
There was little discussion of Sherco on Monday and whether the move away from coal was driving up rates, as Victor Schock, director of utilities for the PSC, has said. 
Alex Nisbet, regulatory policy specialist for Xcel Energy, said that the Sherco impact was “being reviewed at great length” in the case.
Utility companies seeking a rate increase in North Dakota often reach a settlement with the PSC for less than the initial request. 
North Dakota Xcel customers have been paying a higher rate since February, about half the requested increase. 
Nisbet said final rates often end up close to the interim rate. 
Asked if Xcel anticipates moving away from natural gas like it has coal, Nisbet said Xcel plans to build a new natural gas combustion turbine in Minnesota with plans for others. 
WBI Energy is developing a pipeline to bring natural gas from western North Dakota, where it is a byproduct of oil production, to the east. 
“That’s a project that excites us a lot,” he said. 
The PSC held a second public input session Monday evening. The public also can submit comments on the rate case by emailing ndpsc@nd.gov or by mail to: Public Service Commission, 600 E. Boulevard Ave., Dept. 408, Bismarck, ND 58505.
The PSC has set a formal hearing to begin Dec. 1.

The governor, along with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), several other lawmakers and local officials, signed the budget’s multi-pronged road funding pieces in Clinton Township on Monday morning, each donning high-visibility worksite gear and hardhats.
For Whitmer, the signing was not just the normal ceremonial fare – Whitmer’s win list was always missing a legislatively-funded roads deal, despite her efforts to fix the state’s roads through her executive office and a clever bonding program. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I ran on fixing the damn roads, and I’m proud to keep my promise and get it done,” Whitmer said. “This year’s balanced, bipartisan budget makes a record, nearly $2 billion annual investment to fix our state and local roads, which will make everyone’s drive safer and faster. We’re getting this done by ensuring every penny you pay at the pump goes towards our roads. I’m so grateful to legislators on both sides of the aisle for coming together to get this done so we can build reliable roads that last for decades while supporting tens of thousands of good-paying local jobs.”
In all, Whitmer signed seven pieces of legislation to make the road plan work. They include:

House Bill 4180, sponsored by Rep. Donnie Steele (R-Orion);
House Bill 4181, sponsored by Rep. Steve Frisbie (R-Battle Creek);
House Bill 4182, sponsored by Rep. Bradley Slagh (R-Zeeland);
House Bill 4183, sponsored by Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare);
House Bill 4951, sponsored by Rep. Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills);
House Bill 4961, sponsored by Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton); and
Senate Bill 578, sponsored by Sen. Veronica Klinefelt (D-Eastpointe) 

Hall, a Republican leader who found himself seeing eye-to-eye with the Democratic governor on several key budget items this year, called the funding the “biggest roads deal in history,” and a “very big deal for Michigan’s future.”
“We eliminated waste, fraud and abuse in the budget and made smart reforms to make sure the money went to our top priorities,” Hall said. “Our plan finally ensures every penny you pay at the pump goes to road funding, something people have demanded for years. And it sends that money to the local roads and bridges in our neighborhoods, instead of just state highways. Those reforms will make our roads smoother and make life better for the people of Michigan.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks said the budget cycle made the Legislature face unprecedented challenges, but it also gave lawmakers an opportunity to show the rest of the nation how the government can still work for residents in the face of deep political divisions.
“The result: a bipartisan budget that fixes our roads, strengthens public schools, protects health care access, and insulates us from some of the toughest federal cuts,” Brinks said. “Michiganders and their communities stand to benefit both immediately and into the future because of the groundwork we are laying today.” 
Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel, who was present at the signing, said that together, with his county’s partners in the Legislature and Whitmer, they are investing in the infrastructure and assets that will move the state forward.
“With a new, sustained pool of funding, we will enhance our efforts to fix local roads,” Hackel said. “This is a major accomplishment and will make the drive to work or back home smoother and safer for the people of Macomb County.”
The victory lap was warranted after Whitmer fought so long for a legislative roads funding fix, even if it came with some concessions for departmental cuts and needing to find new revenue.
Still, at least two of those funding pieces could be shaky ground as the wheels of the new budget start spinning.
House Bill 4951 enacts a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis products, while House Bill 4961 decouples the state and federal tax codes, blunting the immediate effects of President Donald Trump’s new federal tax cuts.
In the case of the marijuana tax, the policy has been denounced by members of the Michigan cannabis industry and is now the subject of a lawsuit over its passage and impending implementation. If the lawsuit is successful, the tax leaves open a $420 million pothole in the road funding deal.
The decoupling issue is causing heartburn for businesses that were hoping for tax relief on the research and development front, which was anticipated to spur capital growth for innovation. Business groups are now working behind the scenes to lobby the Legislature for changes that would allow some of those tax benefits to reach Michigan sooner than the five year timeline signed into law on Monday. 
Any major scuttling of the decoupling plan could mean a massive hole in state revenues, which is why Democrats fought hard to include it in the final budget deal.
Tyler Theile, vice president and director for public policy with East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group, in an interview with Michigan Advance, said that would be the unfortunate position the state would find itself in if both taxes failed or were heavily altered.
“It makes me think of the phrase, ‘use it up, wear it out, make a do or do without,’” Theile said. “We really might have to figure out how to operate some programs more efficiently.”
In a press conference following the budget cycle’s completion, Hall said that he’s already eyeing next year’s spending plan and that the House GOP was already contemplating deeper cuts, setting up a potential situation where future reductions would serve to plug holes where either of the controversial 2025-26 taxes might have faltered.

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s John Moritz to discuss his article, “In some CT towns, clouds form over new solar developments,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read John’s story here. 
WSHU: Hello, John. You used the example of a project in East Windsor to illustrate how initial enthusiasm for large solar arrays has cooled in some Connecticut towns. So what prompted you to look into this particular case? Was it because there was some testimony in the legislature about it?
JM: Well, what really kicked off this reporting process is earlier this year, during the legislative session, I heard a number of lawmakers who represent towns, including East Windsor and the surrounding area, express their concerns about the development of solar projects, and tried to figure out why. And when I looked into it, I realized that East Windsor, just that town, has roughly a quarter of all the utility-scale solar development in Connecticut. And just so people understand and have an idea of what we’re talking about here. We’re not talking about the kind of panels that might go on the home or on your roof, but these are large facilities that can produce enough power to supply the regional electric grid. So we’re talking, you know, in some cases, acres and acres of solar panels here. And because East Windsor and its surrounding towns have access to transmission lines, as well as relatively cheap, flat farmland that’s already been cleared, it makes that particular area an attractive location for solar developers.
WSHU: But you say, you talk to some of the people who are concerned there, and they seem to have supported this initially, when it was supposed to be in a gravel pit, but when it started spreading into farmland, they seemed concerned about it.
JM: Yeah. When you review the testimony, you will find support in the town for a particular project, Gravel Pit Solar, which came before regulators in 2020. And Gravel Pit Solar is now the largest project in Connecticut and one of the largest solar arrays in all of New England. I should be clear that when the gravel pit developers presented their plans to the Connecticut Siting Council, which is in charge of locating these facilities, they made clear in their plans that while the facility is called Gravel Pit Solar, it would not have just covered this former gravel quarry in the town of East Windsor, but that at the time the plans were for, you know, it to include over 200 acres of surrounding farmland. I think what local residents have expressed is their surprise, once the facility actually started becoming under construction, that it was not confined to that gravel pit, and that when combined with other facilities in the area, they feel that developers are snatching up farmland and altering the rural character of the town where they live.
WSHU: Okay. An issue came up about who approves these projects, and the Siting Council generally has the final say on approving a lot of these projects; the local communities feel that it circumvents local control. And that’s an issue that has happened here in Fairfield County, where UI had some huge power lines that they wanted to run along the rail track, and there was local opposition to that. And so what are lawmakers looking into as far as regulating these types of installations going forward?
JM: I think it’s helpful to take a step back here and understand what the Siting Council is. It’s a state agency that was established in 1971 to regulate and oversee the location of certain critical infrastructure projects, such as power plants, and you mentioned transition lines. They also cover hazardous waste facilities and, more recently, the placement of cell phone towers. And these are projects that you know, I think if anyone were given their druthers, no one would want to have one in their own backyard, but due to the need to have these projects, the Siting Council was created specifically to avoid leaving these decisions up to municipalities, so that one state agency can can make sure that the Connecticut as a whole has enough of these critical infrastructure projects to keep going. Now, with the advent of solar technology, where you can kind of put it, used to be, you know, you would build a power plant along a river or somewhere where, you know, along train lines, where you could bring in fuels to power that power plant. Now, solar fields can kind of go anywhere where there’s flat land that is either cleared or can be cleared to access and harness the sun. It’s called decentralized power generation, and we’re seeing a lot more towns that have maybe never had to deal much with the Siting Council become frustrated because they don’t have control over these projects now.
WSHU: If these developments are slowed down, how does that affect Connecticut’s overall energy goals? You know, we’re trying to reduce emissions and achieve cleaner energy, and this is part of our project to obtain cleaner and less expensive energy.
JM: Yeah. Lawmakers have set a clear goal for the state to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, during which time they aim to eliminate all carbon emissions from the state’s power generation. So in order to meet that goal, one of the things we hear from developers and experts on this is that we’re going to have to ramp up renewables a lot, and cheap solar presents the cheapest and quickest method to do that. You know, we’ve seen that the current administration is obviously very opposed to wind power. There’s not a lot of onshore land-based wind power in Connecticut. We can’t really access geothermal or even hydroelectricity. You know, there’s only a limited amount of capacity for that. So solar represents kind of the biggest way for Connecticut to meet these goals. And when you talk to developers and ask, and I ask them about these concerns that have been raised in places like East Windsor, and they make a point of, you know, we understand why neighbors might be concerned, but we need to develop these facilities in the places where it is most feasible and logical for us to do that now. And that includes, you know, they need flat land, especially farmland that might have already been cleared, and they need access to existing infrastructure such as transmission lines and substations. That kind of puts a pinpoint, so to speak, on certain areas of the state where we might see a lot more placement of these large solar facilities than elsewhere.
WSHU: There’s also a time factor here, because some of the tax credits for these projects are running out because the Trump administration, the big, beautiful bill, has zeroed out a lot of those tax credits.
JM: Yeah, so the tax credits are starting to phase out over the next couple of years, and when projects will be specifically able to get them kind of depends on when they get approval from regulators and when they can start construction. But opponents of some of these projects are trying to use those deadlines to see if they can slow down the process and get it to the point where the developers will no longer be able to access these tax credits, and they think that that might help them in their efforts to oppose the projects. You talk to developers, they’re a little bit more cagey on whether they will say, you know, whether they will be able to go ahead with or without the tax credits. It’s possible that some of these larger projects will be financially sound, even in the event that those tax credits go away, or that they might be able to use them. You know, some of the larger developers have been able to pre-purchase panels, essentially, that they have ready to go and deploy once they get approval. So I think what really remains to be seen is how effective opponents will be in using the tax deadline to oppose some of these projects.
WSHU: So, bottom line, John, for the average electricity rate payers. What does this mean?
JM: I think that that kind of needs to be borne out. But certainly every expert that I’ve talked to has said that, you know, increasing the type of cheap, affordable types of renewable power, such as solar, are likely to bring down electric bills, both in the short term and in the long term, provide more reliability and capacity for our great infrastructure, as we see, you know, the demand for power rise through things like electric vehicles, heat pumps and the rollout of data centers.
So, basically, there will still be a push for more solar. I think we can expect to see that.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_0922_SR_Solar_098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 17:58:38.001534

(SteveDF/Getty Images)Last month, state environment officials issued an order to the New Mexico Department of Transportation to pay $2 million for mishandling and failing to clean up hazardous waste.
It was one of 165 active matters listed in the New Mexico Environment Department’s enforcement roundup for September, which includes updates in allegations of pollution, workplace safety violations and more from the agency.
The order, issued Sept. 25, stemmed from violations and inspections conducted in 2023 at NMDOT’s Materials Testing Laboratory in Santa Fe. The lab, which has been in operation since 1957, conducts experiments on construction materials.
The order said the inspection in 2023 found containers without labels for hazardous waste; improper storage; spills; a lack of employee training and a failure to pay for hazardous waste licenses for the years of 2020 through 2023.
Inspectors “observed numerous containers of hazardous waste that were open and/or deteriorated to the point they could not be considered closed,” the order said.
Further, NMDOT could not provide any documentation demonstrating any plans with first responders in Santa Fe in case of an emergency during the inspection, the order stated.
The 20 violations documented in the 2023 inspection generated a fine of just over $2 million dollars, according to the order, which either needs to be paid or disputed within the next 30 days.
An email and text message to spokespeople at the New Mexico Department of Transportation were acknowledged but unreturned Monday, due to the state holiday.
Another significant fine included a proposed penalty of $300,000 to Aliya’s Foods in Albuquerque after the company failed to protect against hazards that resulted in an employee’s arm amputation after getting it caught in a machine earlier this year.
Aliya’s Foods, which specializes in preparing ready-to-eat frozen meals, did not return messages Monday requesting comment.
The April inspection found employees were cleaning an industrial machine while it was still running. Inspectors also found the worker, employed for less than two months, never received formal training on the machine’s safety mechanisms.
“Employers have a legal and moral obligation to protect workers from preventable hazards, and the Occupational Health and Safety Bureau professionals hold employers accountable to such standards,”Bruce Baizel, the division director for NMED’s Compliance and Enforcement Bureau, said in a statement. “Aliya’s Foods ignored clear warnings about unsafe machinery and failed to enforce basic safety procedures. As a result, a worker suffered a catastrophic and life-changing injury.”

(Stock photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird joined an amicus brief Monday supporting a Tennessee law that requires social media companies to use age verification software. Social media companies are challenging the law.
Tennessee’s 2024 Protecting Children from Social Media Act requires users to verify that they are 18 years or older or get permission from their parent or guardian to make an account on a social media platform. For minors’ accounts, the law requires social media companies provide parents access to monitor the child’s activity and messages, as well as the ability to set time restrictions or revoke access.
NetChoice, a trade association including Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and other social media platforms including X and Reddit, filed a suit challenging the Tennessee law in October 2024. In a news release, Paul Taske, associate director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said the state law “violates free speech rights and jeopardizes the cybersecurity of minors and adults by creating a honeypot of sensitive information for hackers.”
“NetChoice is suing to defend free speech online, prevent big government from compromising data security, and protect parents’ rights to make decisions for their families,” Taske said in a statement. “… Not only does this violate the First Amendment, but it also endangers the security of all Tennesseans, particularly children by creating a data target for hackers and criminals.”
A U.S. District court denied the request from NetChoice for a preliminary injunction to block the law from enforcement. The organization challenged this decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, submitting its opening brief in September.
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, argued in a brief submitted to the appeals court earlier in October the law does not abridge any free speech rights, but provides protection for minors online.
“The law does not control what anyone can say or not say online,” Skrmetti said in a statement. “The harms social media causes kids are well-documented.  Regardless of how much time and money Big Tech spends fighting against meaningful parental tools, Tennessee will continue to look out for our kids and their parents.”
Bird joined a coalition of 34 states and Washington, D.C. in filing a brief, led by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, to support the law. The filing argues social media platforms are “knowingly harming children,” citing studies that have found mental health issues like anxiety, depression and eating disorders are linked with higher social media usage among adolescents.
Bird said she joined the brief in order to help protect children from harms caused by social media.
“Prohibiting companies from profiting off the exploitation of our kids’ mental health is common sense, and it’s the right thing to do,” Bird said in a statement. “Health and safety standards are not unreasonable; they are essential. I’ll continue fighting to protect kids from exploitation.”
NetChoice has succeeded in blocking similar age verification laws through court challenges in states including Ohio and Arkansas.
Iowa lawmakers considered a bill in 2025 to require parental consent for minors to create social media accounts, with parents allowed to revoke access at any time. While there was support in a subcommittee meeting from legislators for a measure giving parents more oversight of their children’s accounts, there were concerns about social media companies’ collection of personal data collection that would be required to implement such a measure.

WILMINGTON — October 16, 2025Hundreds of civic, business, nonprofit, and faith leaders will gather at the Chase Center on the Riverfront this Thursday for the Delaware Leadership Prayer Breakfast, a long-standing tradition that celebrates unity, reflection, and the power of faith in public life.
This year’s keynote speaker is Dr. Timothy Dalrymple, President and CEO of the John Templeton Foundation and former leader of Christianity Today. Known for his thought-provoking work at the intersection of philosophy, faith, and leadership, Dalrymple will share insights on meaning, resilience, and moral courage in a divided world.
“Dr. Dalrymple brings a message that bridges intellect and spirit,” said event co-chair Tim Houseal, who has helped steward the breakfast for more than a decade. “He challenges us to think deeply about how our beliefs shape the way we lead, serve, and live together.”
From Gymnast to Thought Leader
A former national champion gymnast whose career ended with a devastating injury, Dalrymple’s path turned toward theology and the philosophy of religion. He went on to earn degrees from Stanford, Princeton Theological Seminary, and a Ph.D. from Harvard, where his studies focused on the nature of suffering and religious knowledge.
At the John Templeton Foundation, he now oversees one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations dedicated to exploring purpose, spirituality, and human flourishing. During his tenure at Christianity Today, he nearly doubled revenue and expanded the publication’s global reach through new media ventures.
Music with a Delaware Heartbeat
The morning will also feature music from LU Praise, Liberty University’s multi-ethnic gospel choir led by Patrick “Colby” Shorts of Lincoln, Delaware. Shorts, a worship leader and Liberty alumnus, is known for performances that blend spiritual passion with musical excellence.
“Music has a way of connecting people across every boundary,” Shorts said. “When we sing together, we remember what unites us is far greater than what divides us.”
A Tradition of Leadership and Reflection
Since its founding in 1978, the Delaware Leadership Prayer Breakfast has drawn a remarkable array of national figures who have shared their faith and leadership journeys. Past speakers include:


Brian Dawkins (2024) – NFL and Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer


Dr. Betty Uribe (2023) – JPMorgan Chase Managing Director and United Nations Ambassador for Peace & Human Rights


Dr. Francis S. Collins (2022) – Chief Science Advisor to the U.S. President and former Director of the National Institutes of Health


U.S. Senator James Lankford (2019) – Oklahoma senator known for promoting prayer in public life


Eric Metaxas (2016) – Author and nationally syndicated radio host


Pat Williams (2017) – Orlando Magic senior executive and GM of the 1983 World Champion 76ers


Dr. Ben Carson (2001) – Renowned neurosurgeon and later U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development


Joe Gibbs (2000) – Hall-of-Fame NFL coach and NASCAR team owner


Reggie White (2003) – Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer and faith leader


Anne Beiler (2008) – Founder of Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and inspirational entrepreneur


Barry C. Black (2006) – Chaplain of the United States Senate


Bill McCartney (2005) – Founder of Promise Keepers and former college football coach


Through decades of change, the breakfast has remained nonpartisan and interdenominational, focused on bringing Delawareans together in prayer and purpose rather than fundraising or advocacy.
“It’s one of the few spaces left where people can set aside titles and politics,” said longtime organizer Carol Houseal. “For one morning, we remember the deeper purpose behind leadership itself.”

Health officials held a whirlwind 11 public meetings and will close a public survey Wednesday. Residents’ feedback is key to how up to $800M could be spent. 
The post Nurses, senior care, telehealth? Wyoming seeks feedback for how to spend millions in federal health dollars appeared first on WyoFile .","As new challenges emerge for Wyoming’s already fragile health care network, the state stands to receive up to $800 million in federal funds aimed at bolstering rural health.
Wyoming health officials have been racing around the state in an effort to collect public input on priorities before submitting an application to the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. They hope more residents will fill out a survey that’ll be open through Wednesday. 
The process is on a condensed schedule, Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs said. Health department staff held 11 public meetings in the last month. Next they will finalize the application due Nov. 5.
As one of America’s most rural states, Wyoming has plenty of needs and challenges related to its health care network — from the long distances patients travel for care to nursing shortages to affordability concerns in hospitals. Advocates expect other new health care policy changes to further hamper access.
What the health department hopes to glean from feedback, Fuchs said, are the public’s top priorities. 
“We get one bite at the apple, for them to approve or deny it,” Fuchs said. With that in mind, he stressed: “We really focused on public engagement, which I think is different from a lot of states. I know certain states have not done any of this, and so I hope it pays off.”
The survey, he added, only takes eight minutes. 
“We want as much participation as possible,” Fuchs said. “It’s really important for the state.”
Opportunity and loss
The Rural Health Transformation Program, created through President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is designed to funnel $50 billion to states to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers.
Program funding is intended to support priorities like chronic disease prevention, sustaining care access, workforce development and technical assistance. Funding will be dispersed over five years.

Wyoming’s congressional delegation supported the act, and Republican Sen. John Barrasso singled out the rural health program as an enormous opportunity for the state. 
Health care advocates, however, don’t believe short-term funding can create or sustain solutions to make up for the state’s other shortfalls. Wyoming has long struggled with issues like a dearth of medical professionals, the precarious financial viability of hospitals and deteriorating specialty services.
Recent changes also related to the Beautiful Bill Act will only exacerbate the issue, advocates say. 
The act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in an estimated 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally. That’s expected to have downstream effects. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, an economic analysis finds. 
Some 46,000 state residents, meanwhile, get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the bill did not renew them. That will result in significant premium spikes for some patients.
Between 11,000-20,000 state residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated marketplace cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming.
High-level
Starting in September, health department staff hosted eight in-person and three virtual meetings on the topic. Meetings took place from Newcastle to Lander, Buffalo to Saratoga. 
Rather than requesting detailed solution proposals, Fuchs said, the federal application asks for “pretty high-level” data on state demographics, current health insurance coverage and chronic conditions. Health department staff, he added, has focused public outreach on narrowing priorities so it can outline strategic initiatives.
People aired all kinds of concerns in the meetings, he said, including workforce shortages, preventative health choices, maternity care gaps and behavioral health needs.

Residents who take the survey also will be able to weigh in on the importance of things like hospital accountability, mobile health units and transportation options for getting to care. 
Though a significant opportunity, Fuchs said, he is cautious about the federal program’s potential to truly transform Wyoming’s health care landscape. 
“I think we want to be realistic,” he said. “$500 million over five years, it’s certainly nice and we want to be responsible stewards of that money and try to make it go the farthest it can. At the end of the day, we’re just hoping to do the best we can with the money, make sure that it goes to good use and try to make these as sustainable as possible.”

Josh Stein announced Monday that the state’s medical debt relief initiative has eliminated roughly $6.5 billion in medical debt for 2.5 million North Carolinians.
The program, launched under former Gov. Roy Cooper last July, has far surpassed its initial projection of $4 billion in alleviated debt, and Stein and Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai said they will continue to search for debts to alleviate.
Focused on debt deemed “uncollectible,” the relief program incentivized the state’s 99 acute care hospitals to relieve medical debt for low- and middle-income patients and expand charity care policies as conditions for receiving higher payments through Medicaid’s Healthcare Access and Stabilization Program. The state also instructed hospitals to stop reporting medical debt to credit agencies.

“For many people, the debt service serves as an anvil holding them back from opportunity and a better life, from getting a mortgage or a small business loan,” Stein said in a news conference at the Executive Mansion. “Unlike most other forms of debt, medical debt is not a choice. Nobody chooses to have a heart attack or get diagnosed with a chronic condition — you just have to deal with it.”
Stein thanked Cooper and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kody Kinsley, the latter of whom was in attendance, for spearheading the “first-of-its-kind” initiative to use federal health care funds as leverage to change hospitals’ debt policies.
“Most of the debt had been on the books for years. It only served to deprive people who had no way of paying back of a brighter financial future,” he said. “If they could have paid, they would have paid.”
The North Carolina Healthcare Association, an advocacy group for the hospital industry, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The program was able to surpass its initial forecast as participating hospitals found additional debt that could be relieved through the review process that was not included in the initial negotiation between NCDHHS and health care providers, Stein said, adding that he expects that number to grow as hospitals continue the relief process.
To inform North Carolinians that their debt has been erased, NCDHHS has partnered with charity Undue Medical Debt to send explanation letters to those impacted. Undue Medical Debt is set to mail more than 250,000 letters this week informing residents they no longer owe their balances.
“I am particularly proud to highlight that North Carolina’s approach is particularly unique because it facilitates, in the short term, debt relief for families today, while incentivizing long- term policy changes that will end the cycle of medical debt by attacking it at its root cause, ending it before it even starts,” said Undue Medical Debt board vice chair Jose Penabad.

Stein also used the news conference Monday to reiterate calls for the North Carolina General Assembly to fully fund the state’s Medicaid program and for Congress to renew Affordable Care Act subsidies. “We have so much work to do to improve people’s health and financial wellbeing,” Stein said.
While the program is based on conditioning federal dollars for hospitals, the ongoing government shutdown has not impacted the debt relief efforts, Sangvai said.
He added that NCDHHS will continue to evaluate the effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and its changes to Medicaid and HASP, but the debt relief policy changes at the hospital level help ensure the sustainability of the program regardless of federal health care policy.
“This is not a one-time fix,” Sangvai said. “It is a sustainable model that will continue to reduce debt burden and improve access to care for the years ahead,” Sangvai said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA134462-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 17:58:38.001534

Nevada’s cooperation with federal agents violates state law, is eroding the integrity of the judicial system, and is hurting tourism, the ACLU alleges. 
“This isn’t intended to disparage LVMPD,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said Monday at a news conference announcing the legal action against Metro and Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill. He suggests Metro acquiesced to the federal government because of President Donald Trump’s “administration’s perpetual threats against municipalities, local governments and state governments.” 
Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE, named for a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows police to issue civil immigration warrants and detain individuals up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so that federal agents may take them into custody. The agreement violates Nevada law, according to the lawsuit, because it was not condoned by state lawmakers. 
Nevada is a Dillon’s Rule state, Haseebullah noted, meaning “if the Nevada Legislature does not grant authority for the local agency to act, the agency cannot do that action.”
State law provides that county jails may house prisoners at the request of the federal government, “but only upon payment of ‘all actual and reasonably necessary costs’ of such confinement,” the suit says, adding even if the term ‘prisoner’ referred to someone with a civil immigration infraction, Metro’s agreement with ICE violates Dillon’s Rule, because it requires Metro to cover all associated costs. 
The suit was filed on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who was found guilty of attempted possession of a stolen vehicle, a gross misdemeanor. He was sentenced by Judge Tara Newberry Clark to an inpatient treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health, and upon completion, to outpatient treatment. Instead, he is being held in the Clark County Detention Center. 
“The unlawful hold, caused by ICE’s 287(g) agreement with LVMPD, has trapped him in indefinite detention, directly obstructing a lawful court order issued by a Nevada judge,” the ACLU said in a news release. The filing asks a court to lift the hold and order Metro to end its agreement.  
The suit, Haseebullah said, is another ACLU has “had to file because of this administration’s desire to create as much instability as they can within our communities.”
He says he expects the case to land before the Nevada Supreme Court. 
“We’d love to get the proper outcome at the District Court level, but I imagine this will go up,” he said at the news conference. “We need a substantive ruling to know whether or not Nevada municipalities or local law enforcement agencies have the ability to act without approval from the state that funds them in large part.”
McMahill, who long maintained Metro would not assist federal agents with immigration enforcement, entered into a 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with ICE on June 16 of this year, according to the lawsuit, “after the federal government idiotically labeled Las Vegas a ‘sanctuary city’ without even defining ‘sanctuary city,’ and forced Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work…” Haseebullah said. An exhibit attached to the suit reveals that as of Sept. 1,  LVMPD received 957 requests for assistance from ICE this year. 
“In Nevada, sheriffs and political subdivisions, such as LVMPD, have no existence or powers except by grant of Nevada’s Legislature,” says the ACLU’s pleading. 
“I recognize the tough position that the sheriff’s been put in, that the Mayor of the city of Las Vegas has been put in when they signed an agreement,” Haseebullah noted. “We recognize the decisions made by this administration don’t come with any sort of intellectual honesty.”
The sanctuary designation, he noted, is a “legal misnomer” that is bereft of common definition. 
Nevada was removed from the federal list of sanctuary designations last month after Gov. Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives. 
In 2019,  then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations. Nevada was not among those states. 
Lombardo, however, informally honored provisions of the agreement after he announced its suspension.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — A 340-member club of business and professional leaders in South Dakota’s largest city hopes its public Q&A events will counteract what club members call a growing breakdown in communication and trust among Americans. 
Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club President Eric Erickson told South Dakota Searchlight that the service club’s members are concerned about polarization and violence. He hopes to make peacebuilding and conflict prevention a theme of some of the club’s regularly scheduled public Q&A sessions with local and state leaders.
“We’re not expecting everyone to ultimately agree, but we’re saying that when you do disagree, here’s the civil way to do it,” he said.


Commentary on civility

Governor squanders his credibility on civil discourse with ‘eat a salad’ comment
John Thune has a chance to be an example of civility for the country



The first themed discussion on Monday brought together a political science professor, a civil discourse advocate and educator, and a counselor. Moderated by Erickson, the foundational discussion explored topics ranging from empathy and identity politics to the importance of maintaining civic norms.
Erickson said future events in the series may bring together people who stand on opposite sides of issues.
“It takes courage to stand up and say, ‘This is what I believe in,’ but it also takes an equal amount of courage to say, ‘I understand you believe something differently, and I’m willing to sit here and listen,’” Erickson said.
Monday’s political science professor panelist, David Wiltse with South Dakota State University, warned that declining participation in civic institutions — like churches and political parties — has weakened the “social fabric” that once connected Americans. He called groups like Rotary essential in helping bridge differences and rebuild trust.
Erickson said the club’s role is to lead by example and show that civility and disagreement can coexist.
“We want to create a space where these conversations don’t break down into finger-pointing and shouting,” Erickson said. “It’s about understanding, not winning.”

Market St. in Iowa City. (Photo via Google Earth)The bankrupt Mercy Hospital of Iowa City is taking its former business partners, MercyOne and Catholic Health Initiatives, to court in a dispute over $55 million.
A federal lawsuit, filed on behalf of the Iowa City hospital and its creditors, accuses MercyOne and CHI of scuttling a planned business deal so as to avoid the obligation of paying workers’ pensions while giving a six-figure severance package to a former top executive who often failed to show up for work.
The claims within the lawsuit, originally made in August as part of Mercy-Iowa City’s ongoing bankruptcy case, are now a separate cause of action that alleges breach of contract, unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary duty.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
MercyOne and its fellow defendants have yet to file a response to the lawsuit, but in a statement issued after the August filing, MercyOne said it has “always acted in the best interests of Mercy-Iowa City.”
MercyOne said it “has become a potential scapegoat for the impact of bankruptcy,” adding that “there is no basis for any claim against MercyOne or any affiliated entity or individual.”
Mercy Hospital-Iowa City and its Liquidation Trust Oversight Committee are suing MercyOne, CHI and an affiliate, Iowa Heart Center, in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa in an effort to avoid what the plaintiffs call “fraudulent transfers” to MercyOne and Iowa Heart Center.
The lawsuit seeks to recover, on behalf of the Iowa City hospital’s creditors, at least $55 million.
Also named as a defendant in the case is Sean Williams, the former president and CEO of the Iowa City hospital. The lawsuit claims Williams breached his fiduciary duty to the institution by quietly advancing MercyOne’s interests at the expense of the hospital he was hired to lead.
The Liquidation Trust Oversight Committee alleges the Iowa City hospital transferred funds to MercyOne as required by an affiliation agreement the two entered into in 2017, purportedly as part of a move that would allow MercyOne to help the Iowa City hospital with financial and operational issues the latter was facing.
According to the lawsuit, MercyOne made numerous representations to the Iowa City hospital that it would work toward implementing a “complete and strategic affiliation relationship” that would have essentially resulted in a merger.
The agreement, the lawsuit states, was viewed as an “engagement ring,” with the details and formalities of the “corporate wedding” to be worked out at a later date.
Rather than helping the Iowa City hospital address its problems, the lawsuit claims, MercyOne and CHI exacerbated those problems, saddling Mercy Hospital-Iowa City “with steep payment obligations to MercyOne in exchange for a number of services that MercyOne did not provide.”
Additionally, the lawsuit alleges, despite continuing representations to the contrary, MercyOne did not deliver promised services and staff related to financial management, purchasing, risk management, human resources, clinical oversight, medical-staff credentialing, physician recruitment and telemedicine services.
By failing to acknowledge its lack of intent to complete the affiliation, the lawsuit claims, MercyOne induced the Iowa City hospital “to continue on in an expensive relationship for over four years.”
Eventually, the lawsuit claims, MercyOne, faced with its own operating losses and the desire to avoid taking on the additional financial obligation of the Iowa City hospital’s underfunded pension plan, opted to abandon the planned affiliation.
When MercyOne “finally told” the Iowa City hospital of its plans to end their relationship, Mercy Hospital-Iowa City’s financial situation had deteriorated to the point where it was much less attractive to any other potential acquisition partner, the lawsuit claims.
CEO accused of putting staff at risk 
In addition to the allegations against MercyOne and its parent, CHI, the liquidation committee alleges that Williams, the Iowa City hospital’s CEO from 2018 to 2021, worked against the hospital’s own interests.
Williams had previously served as MercyOne’s CEO for Mercy Medical Center-Clinton and was part of MercyOne’s executive team, the lawsuit notes, and alleges that he “was strongly encouraged to, and did, resign” in 2021.
During his tenure as CEO, Williams “was regularly absent” from the hospital during business hours, the lawsuit claims, and on one of his first days of employment, he directed the staff to remove the desktop computer that had been set up for him, stating he did not need it.
“Williams largely attempted to perform his role as CEO,” the lawsuit alleges, “from a smartphone, and was known to have issues reviewing or accessing important documents.”
The lawsuit goes on to allege that at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and through his resignation in September 2021, Williams “refused to wear a mask” when at the hospital, despite mask-related directives from the State of Iowa and the hospital’s own policy requiring masks.
“Numerous staff and medical providers at Mercy-Iowa City were furious that their CEO risked their safety during the pandemic by refusing to wear a mask,” the lawsuit alleges. “Williams placed Mercy-Iowa City’s reputation and, most importantly, the health and lives of Mercy-Iowa City’s employees, at significant risk during the COVID-19 pandemic by refusing to wear a mask… Williams’ conduct constitutes gross negligence, bad faith, and/or willful misconduct.”
The lawsuit also alleges Williams had the Iowa City hospital enter into an agreement with the Iowa Heart Center, a wholly owned subsidiary of MercyOne, which involved the center leasing space and equipment from Mercy Hospital-Iowa City at far less than market value, damaging the hospital’s financial position.
On Dec. 1, 2020, the lawsuit claims, Williams was placed on a performance improvement plan. In August 2021, the hospital’s board chairman met with Williams to review his performance, and it was during that meeting that Williams indicated he would resign, the lawsuit alleges.
Although the board did not approve any severance pay for Williams, according to the lawsuit, MercyOne allegedly invoiced the Iowa City hospital $475,975 for severance payments routed to Williams.

A jury has convicted a former Connecticut man of murder in the death of a Northeast Kingdom man nearly six years ago.
The jury returned its guilty verdict on Friday in Orleans County Superior criminal court in Newport, convicting Brownswell Cedano, 31, of a charge of second-degree murder in the death of 37-year-old Richard Poginy of Glover in November 2019 in Barton.
The verdict followed a six-day trial.

Cedano, a resident of Hartford, Connecticut, at the time, assaulted Poginy outside a Barton home on Nov. 2, 2019, and fled the scene, according to charging documents. 
Poginy, according to police, then drove away from the residence and crashed his vehicle a short distance away while driving at a low speed. He died a week later at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, court records stated. 
Initially, police did not report his death as a homicide. Later, following an autopsy and additional investigation, a medical examiner ruled the cause of Poginy’s death was “complications of blunt impact head injuries” and the manner of death was a homicide, according to police.
According to the medical examiner’s findings, the “documented minor damage to the vehicle without airbag deployment suggests a low-speed collision that is inconsistent with the severity of the head injuries.”
A sentencing date on the murder conviction had not been set as of Monday afternoon. The conviction carries a sentence of 20 years to life in prison. 
Orleans County State’s Attorney Farzana Leyva, whose office prosecuted the case, declined comment Monday. 
Michael Shane, Cedano’s attorney, could not be reached Monday for comment. 
Cedano had been sentenced in November 2022 to seven years in federal prison following a conviction for drug distribution in Rutland County, according to court records.
He was among four people arrested in November 2020 after authorities raided an apartment in Rutland City, seizing cocaine, fentanyl, illegal prescription drugs and four firearms, federal court records stated.
In addition to selling illegal drugs in Rutland County, according to federal prosecutors, Cedano was also trafficking heroin and cocaine in Orleans County. At the time of the drug raid in Rutland, court records stated, Cedano was on probation for a Connecticut drug offense while he was traveling to Vermont to sell drugs.
Cedano was listed by the Vermont Department of Corrections on Monday as incarcerated at the Northern State Correctional Facility in Newport.

Vermont Blue Advantage will no longer offer any Medicare Advantage plans in the state for 2026. 
On October 1, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont announced Vermont Blue Advantage would not continue coverage for the 26,000 people in the state on its individual Medicare Advantage plans for next year. The company is also ending all existing employer-sponsored retiree plans.
Whether the company will return to Vermont’s insurance landscape in the future, “depends on whether market conditions improve, or new opportunities open that would enable Vermont Blue Advantage to offer sustainable and competitive plans,” Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer, told VTDigger.

Vermont Blue Advantage has provided Medicare Advantage coverage for the state’s 7,000 retired teachers, but that contract was not renewed for 2026, the Office of the State Treasurer announced in September. The shift was unplanned but necessary after Vermont Blue Advantage proposed a 50% premium increase in July, according to Treasurer Mike Pieciak.
Two other smaller employers also coordinated coverage for their retirees through Vermont Blue Advantage plans, Kaj Samsom, the state’s commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, confirmed. Those employers are also losing that option in 2026. 
Medicare Advantage plans, also known as Part C plans, are an option to those eligible for Medicare. The plans are run by a private company with federal funding and generally include broader coverage than traditional Medicare, which covers 80% of health expenses and requires a separate plan for prescription drug coverage. 
Vermonters who lose coverage when their Medicare Advantage plans end will have the option to enroll in a Medigap private plan to supplement traditional Medicare, the state’s health care advocate Mike Fisher told lawmakers last week. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has faced severe solvency issues due to an unanticipated increase in the number and complexity of claims. The nonprofit insurer lost $152 million between 2021 and 2024, according to its reporting to the state. At least 20% came from losses through Vermont Blue Advantage, which Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont runs in conjunction with its counterpart and parent company in Michigan, since sale of the Medicare Advantage plans launched in 2021. 
Simultaneously, insurers all across the country have been scaling back their Medicare Advantage coverage as changes in federal regulations have made the plans less profitable for those who run them. 
Next year, Vermonters who live in most of the state’s counties who purchase their Medicare plans themselves will have no Medicare Advantage plans available to them. In addition to the end of the Vermont Blue Advantage option, UnitedHealthcare — one of the largest purveyors of Medicare Advantage plans nationwide — announced on October 1 that it also no longer would sell its plans in Vermont. That plan served roughly 7,800 Vermonters, according to United Healthcare.
Now, the only plans available for individuals to purchase are a handful of Humana Advantage plans in Bennington, Caledonia, Essex, Orange, Windham and Windsor counties.
However, employers that provide retiree medical benefits still have other options. 
New insurer for Vermont teachers
After the high premium increase proposed by Vermont Blue Advantage, the Vermont Treasurer’s office struck a three-year contract with the insurance company HealthSpring to cover the retired teachers plan. HealthSpring also has been providing coverage to Vermont State College retirees. 
The teachers will still experience a 16.2% rate increase on the HealthSpring plan — though it is a far cry from Vermont Blue Advantage’s proposed 50% increase. 
“The 50% increase was kind of shocking for me and for everybody that was reviewing this,” Treasurer Pieciak said. In previous years, the premiums increased around 5-10%. 
“I think just those two numbers tell the story about the state of healthcare,” he added. “Who would have thought that a 16% increase would be something that you’d be happy with?” 
Still, Pieciak says that the shift saves those covered by the plan from paying hundreds of dollars a year in additional premiums, and it saves the state “tens of millions of dollars” required for its portion of the plans. It also would have increased the unfunded pension liability by $215 million, he said. 
The treasurer said his office weighed four questions in their decision to shift to HealthSpring: “What were the benefits? What was the network? What was the cost? And then what was the stability of the carrier and the contract?” 
The benefits on the HealthSpring plans are the same or stronger, as those on Vermont Blue Advantage, Pieciak said.
Pieciak is optimistic that the shift to HealthSpring will offer some stability for the plans in the state. “The scale that [HealthSpring is] able to bring to the challenge that we’re facing here in Vermont on health care affordability is beyond anything that we can do on our own,” he said. “Maybe it’s better, in this particular area of insurance, to have a more experienced, much larger player.” 
Unexpected benefit
Patient advocates note one there are some upsides for current Medicare Advantage policyholders losing coverage if they want to shift to traditional Medicare. 
“This is not an all good or an all bad situation,” the state’s health care advocate Mike Fisher said at a legislative committee meeting at the Statehouse Thursday. “I know there are those that are celebrating it because they hate Medicare Part C.” 
If individuals themselves choose to leave Medicare Advantage, for traditional Medicare, they may face obstacles getting a supplemental commercial plan, called Medigap, which can cover the remainder of expenses that traditional Medicare does not. Federal law allows those insurers to either deny coverage entirely or charge higher premiums based on pre-existing health conditions. 
However, if people lose their coverage due to the plan no longer being offered, they are protected from those increased costs by federal and state regulations. 
But Fisher cautioned during the meeting that many Medigap plans in Vermont are prohibitively expensive, even with those protections. 
“My big fear is that with the loss of the [Medicare Advantage] market, we are going to really drive up the number of Vermonters with no secondary coverage. Predictably, many of them will have costs they can’t pay for,” he told the committee.
The annual open enrollment period for individuals to choose Medicare plans for the coming year begins Oct. 15 and runs through Dec. 7, but those losing their coverage have a special enrollment period through Feb. 28, 2026 — though waiting until the new year to enroll may cause a gap in coverage as the plans close out at the end of 2025. 
Vermont Blue Advantage has guidance for patients navigating the change of coverage. 
The State Health Insurance Program (SHIP) is also prepared to help Medicare beneficiaries navigate their coverage and is gearing up for a surge in demand as thousands of Vermonters need to pivot in their Medicare plans. The Medicare handbook, Medicare.gov and 1-800-Medicare also remain resources for individuals to find new plans — and are functioning even as the federal government shutdown enters its second week.

You've won. I mean, you've won. Now it's time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East. It's about time you were able to enjoy the fruits of your labor,” Trump said during remarks that lasted just over an hour.Israeli military forces, with financial and arms support from the United States, have bombarded the Gaza Strip since Hamas militants launched a surprise attack on Israel from the Palestinian territory on Oct. 7, 2023, killing roughly 1,200 and taking 250 people captive. Gaza health officials said Monday the death toll in the small enclave had risen to 67,869 since the conflict began, including roughly 60 in the past 24 hours, according to Palestinian National Authority state-run media.Hamas returned the remaining living 20 Israeli hostages Monday and committed to returning bodies of deceased hostages as part of the ceasefire agreement. In exchange, Israel released roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.As of Monday, Hamas still had to return the remains of two dozen hostages killed while held captive. The militant group that holds political power in Gaza returned the remains of four hostages to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, CNN reported Monday.Trump calls for Netanyahu pardonMany who attended Trump’s Knesset remarks wore red MAGA-style hats bearing the message “Trump the Peace President,” according to journalists who traveled with Trump to Israel.Trump said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be remembered “far more” for the peace deal than for the fighting. Trump notably asked Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, who is under investigation for bribery and fraud.“Hey, I have an idea. Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?” Trump said, adding, “Cigars and some champagne — who the hell cares?”Egypt meetingTrump then traveled to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Monday evening, where roughly 30 world leaders met for a short summit marking the deal between Israel and Hamas — with many details yet to be hammered out.Among those present was Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian National Authority. Video published by The New York Times showed Trump and Abbas chatting and shaking hands. Trump held onto Abbas’ hand while giving a thumbs-up with his other hand for a photo of the pair.Trump invited Netanyahu, but the prime minister declined “due to time constraints” ahead of an upcoming holiday, according to an announcement posted by his office.Trump, along with the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, signed what the president described as a “document that’s going to spell out a lot of rules and regulations.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for text of the document.Speaking to reporters as he signed the “historic document” in front of two rows of presidents and prime ministers, Trump marveled at how long it took to achieve the cessation of hostilities and predicted “it’s gonna hold up, too.”The 20-point peace plan required the release of all living and deceased Israeli hostages, a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces and a reform of the Palestinian government, including completely disarming Hamas of weapons and political power. World leaders heaped praise on Trump at Monday’s summit. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the U.S. president is “a man of peace” and that he backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, according to video and reports from journalists at the summit. Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi awarded Trump the Nile Collar, his country’s highest state honor.U.S. leaders reactU.S. Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike praised the freeing of the surviving Israeli hostages.House Speaker Mike Johnson applauded the “leadership, strength, and fortitude of President Trump.”“For the first time in 738 days, there are no living Israelis hostages (sic) in the hands of Hamas. In just eight and half months in office, President Trump and his Administration have ensured the safe release and return of all 20 living Israeli hostages from Hamas captivity, putting lasting peace in the Middle East within reach,” the Louisiana Republican said in a statement Monday.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who delivered a scathing rebuke on the Senate floor to Netanyahu’s leadership last year, celebrated the ceasefire deal Monday.“Today is a wonderful day. Finally, finally, finally, the last living hostages brutally held by Hamas are home, an immense and overwhelming sigh of relief. I commend the enormous advocacy of the tireless hostage families, President Trump, his administration, and all who helped make this moment happen,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.“Today, we celebrate the return of the hostages — the joyous images of their reuniting with their families — and we solemnly reaffirm our commitment to bringing home all the deceased hostages, including my constituents Omer Neutra and Itay Chen.”Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, an outspoken critic of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, urged the immediate activation of humanitarian aid to the territory, including granting “unfettered access” to the United Nations.The Vermont senator, who caucuses with Democrats, said in a statement that Americans must “grapple with our role in this extremely dark chapter,” highlighting that the U.S. government provided billions in taxpayer dollars to support what he described as “Netanyahu’s barbaric campaign.”“The vast majority of Americans understand that Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack that killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages,” Sanders said. “But most Americans also understand that Israel did not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, killing or wounding almost 237,000 Palestinians — more than 10 percent of Gaza’s population — most of them women, children, and the elderly.”",,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

""We’ve done 15 so far, and we’re not at our busy season yet,"" said Brian Lindner, a founding member of the Waterbury Backcountry Rescue Team.

This story by Sarah Andrews was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout via the Community News Service, which is part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program. 
WATERBURY — A few weeks ago, a young man wandered off the Bamforth Ridge Trail on Camel’s Hump. At around 3 a.m., his cell phone battery was exhausted, and he was guiding himself by the cardiac monitor light on his smartwatch.
Around 1 a.m., Waterbury Backcountry Rescue Team was called out to find the missing hiker. The team searched the trails for hours before one member saw that flashing green cardiac light in the darkness. The team located the lost hiker and guided him back to the parking lot. 
Through the start of Octobor, the team had responded to 15 calls so far this year, compared to 10 in all of 2024, according to Brian Lindner, a founding member of the group. “The numbers just change drastically,” Lindner said. “2025 is looking to be a record year … and we’re not at our busy season yet.” 
Whether it’s frozen boots or broken tibias, Waterbury Backcountry Rescue Team is prepared to respond to any kind of backcountry crisis.  Since the organization began responding to emergencies in Waterbury’s outdoor recreation areas in 2002, it has rescued almost 300 hikers, skiers and mountain bikers.
WBRT is made up of 21 volunteers, all of whom are extensively trained to respond quickly and safely to crises on the summits of nearby peaks in the Green Mountains, such as Camel’s Hump, Mt. Hunger and Bolton Mountain.  The group was founded to fill the need for specialized backcountry rescues, a responsibility that used to fall under the purview of the Waterbury Fire Department. 
Backcountry rescues often require more than a dozen responders to execute properly, and often require highly technical training and precise equipment. “It was just willy-nilly,” Lindner said of those early days. “We had the wrong people there in the wrong places.”
“The firefighters are firefighters, and they were the ones getting called to respond to lost and injured people outside of their typical urban terrain,” said Heidi Higgins-Cutler, an EMT and longtime member of WBRT.
The backcountry rescue team was first formed as a special unit of Waterbury Ambulance Service, Inc. The nonprofit EMS outfit has been around since 1971, serving Waterbury, Duxbury and Moretown, along with neighboring EMS agencies as needed.
On a recent afternoon, Lindner and Higgins-Cutler shared stories of their rescues while they sat in Waterbury Ambulance Service’s newly built Steele Rescue Station. They were interrupted by the chatter of walkie-talkies and muffled radio calls.

Higgins-Cutler has been an EMT with Waterbury Ambulance Service, Inc. since 1982. She says that she has seen the need for backcountry response grow as more people get interested in the outdoors. “I got involved to be a caregiver, and to help carry where I can,” she said. “I’ve spent a lot of time on the mountain, and it holds a special place for me, so (WBRT) does as well.”
Lindner has been a first responder since 1986. During his childhood, his father worked as the patrol director at Stowe Mountain. “I actually remember getting dragged along on some of those rescues by him. I guess it was just the natural thing to do,” Lindner said.
More than half of the calls WBRT responds to are for searches, and WBRT responds quickly, Lindner said. “We’ve got a team in the woods, on the fly, and moving, within the first hour. That is not standard procedure,” he said.
In January 2011, a couple was skiing and snowboarding on Camel’s Hump. The pair got separated, and the woman got trapped in a ravine. The couple called 911, and the young woman was located, well after sunset, by a Vermont National Guard helicopter. Unhurt, the woman was guided out of the ravine by WBRT.  “We respond to a lot of those calls, where they are trapped by darkness,” Lindner said.
In fall foliage season now and as winter begins, Lindner stressed the importance of preparation by those heading out into the backcountry.  “The big thing we see is people going up on a warm sunny day, it’s 2 in the afternoon… It’s just wonderful. And they get up there, and this time of year, it gets dark quicker. It’s just being totally unprepared for the changing season,” Lindner said.
Higgins-Cutler adds that darkness is not the only potential hazard. “The folks who go with no water, they go with no food, no extra clothes, or 15% on their phone battery. Then, they are surprised when it takes us an hour and a half to get to them,” she said.
Higgins-Cutler and Lindner say that hydration and warm clothing are non-negotiables as the seasons change. “Headlamps are huge, fluids are huge, extra clothing is huge,” Lindner said. “Lone hikers are frequent; unprepared hikers are constant.”

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I don’t think we’ve done a very good job of engaging with people who are receiving our services, friends and family,” Hoy said in a speech at the EXPO gala Oct. 11 at the Monona Terrace Community and Convention Center in Madison, explaining the reason for conducting Friends and Family Forums between DOC management and the public.
Hoy, one of two keynote speakers during the “EXPOnential” gala, expressed the aim of overcoming challenges confronted by people caught up in the carceral system, including several honorees at the event who had served time in prison, some still on community supervision, including a woman working on becoming a certified peer counselor, a former Iraq war vet and practicing lawyer from Eau Claire, and a newly appointed official for Milwaukee.
EXPO is a non-profit advocacy group in Wisconsin that works to end mass incarceration, dismantle structural discrimination and restore formerly incarcerated people to community life. It’s largely staffed by the formerly incarcerated, including its executive director, Jerome Dillard, who explained the theme of the gala.
The term exponential, he said, is  “not just a gala name, but it’s a map of mercy and it’s an algorithm of potential. An exponent takes a small number and it raises it and turns it into two, into many and sparks into a skyline. And that’s what Wisconsin EXPO is. It’s organizing with formerly incarcerated neighbors to restore rights.”

Marianne Oleson, operations director for EXPO, noted the Beth Israel Center, a conservative synagogue in Madison, was receiving the Ally Organization of the Year recognition for its “shared love” with EXPO’s goals.
“Beth Israel has opened their doors so that we can gather, learn and share our truth with the community, but their generosity extends far beyond the walls of their synagogue,” said Oleson. “They have opened their homes and they have opened their hearts to us. They share their wisdom, compassion, creativity. in so many ways that remind us what true allyship looks like. They give our state residents rides, share the incredible gifts of art, and they bring us homemade lasagna.”

Deandrea “Dee” Hardman received the Woman of the Year recognition. Hardman said before going to prison she had made many bad decisions, living on the streets, surrounded by people who took advantage of her, and burning bridges with people in her life, so that when she left the chaos of her life for prison, she actually felt free.
“Going to prison disrupted my tormented cycle,” she said. “It was the first time I felt like I had an option to choose a different life. I had every opportunity that came my way to grow and change.”
In prison she became a certified welder and participated in work release, and even though she was surrounded by others who didn’t want to change their behavior from the street, she chose differently.
She said being able to reenter society in the EXPO Safe House helped her succeed outside of prison.
“I came home and worked extremely hard, but it was not solely my hard work that got me here — It was my sisters who supported me in the home and everyone who works within the organization,” she said. “For the first time in my life, I was leaving an institution not alone, but with an entire team of people behind me who wanted to help me and have absolutely nothing but the best for me.”
Hardman noted that she had just received her certification to become a peer support specialist and her aim was to share her experience with others to overcome the trauma of addiction and imprisonment.

Man of the Year David Carlson said Expo was one of the first organizations that helped him gain a “foothold” and “get traction in rebuilding my life after re-entry.”
His wife, Alicia Carlson, said her husband was identified by  the number “558672” when he was serving time in prison, but recently he had obtained another number, “1138342,” his state bar license number to practice law in Wisconsin.
“He stepped out of a system that had silenced him and set out on a mission to make people listen, and just as important to make sure that those around him, especially those who’ve been overlooked, blocked out, written off, were seen and heard too,” she said.
Of the two numbers identifying her husband, she said, one reminded him of what it was like to be silenced and the other “gives him a platform to make sure others never are.”
Carlson described the initiatives  her husband launched since he left prison, including a peer support agency with 80 mentors operating in 30 western Wisconsin counties
Carlson, who is now the Justice Forward Wisconsin Coalition coordinator, noted he was sentenced after serving a second tour in Iraq in the military. While in the Stanley Correctional Facility, he had the opportunity to leave early under the earned release program, but he was a self-described  “hothead” who probably was going to serve his whole sentence until a mentor, a fellow resident, saw his potential.
“Instead of seeing me as a dumb, young hothead, he really took me time to mentor me,” Carlson said. “I think mentorship is a key theme in my life and my success in what I have accomplished.”
The Justice Forward Wisconsin Coalition, he said, is a network of “justice-impacted individuals mentoring each other and advocating for each other.”
He said the work needs to be led by those who have experienced incarceration.
“But if you’ve never felt what it feels like to be by yourself in solitary confinement, if you’ve never felt what it feels like to be a teenager in solitary confinement missing your mom, if you’ve never felt what it feels like to be treated and dehumanized after a visit, strip searched, told to bend over and cough — like, these types of things never go away,” he said. “I’m 10 years out, and it never goes away. I’m a lawyer, and it never goes away… I think that it’s time that individuals that have those experiences lead the way, and that’s what this coalition is about.”

Adam Procell, the new director of Community Wellness and Safety for the City of Milwaukee, a position that aims to prevent and reduce violence through community partnerships, received the Ramiah Whiteside Changemaker recognition.
Procell said on the first day of his new position he went back to the site where 35 years earlier, at age 15, when he was a gang member, he had killed 18-year-old Robert Bruce.
“Day One of my job, I went and started at the scene of my crime because I knew I was going to have to ask others to lean into uncomfortable situations,” said Procell, “So I can’t ask the community to lean into uncomfortability unless I take my two feet to be the most uncomfortable place on the face of this Earth, which is where Robert lost his life.”
Procell said there was much pressure on him to succeed and he admitted that he needed help and encouragement. He said others should also be honest about their struggles, adding that “transformation is never born in isolation – It rises from connections.” 
“It wasn’t punishment that changed me. It was the love and hope that I got when I came into this community that made a huge difference, and it changed me,” Procell said.
Hoy talks about changing the DOC culture
During his keynote speech, Hoy noted that in one of his early training sessions at the DOC, he participated in an exercise for recruits in which they were asked whether they perceived themselves as different from those they would be supervising or the same, and he perceived himself as the same.
“And that always stuck with me, because fundamentally I don’t see myself at all different than any people that are being sentenced to Wisconsin DOC,”  he said. 
Hoy said he was challenged by Procell to talk to those receiving services from the DOC to see how effective those services were.
Hoy said he told his staff that they would sit in a room with members of the community to listen.
“It’s just to hear how our policies, how our decisions, impact the lives of not only the people that we care for, provide services to, but their friends and family, and it’s probably been one of the best things that I’ve done since I started,” he said.
Hoy thought the forums would be opportunities to educate the public as well as providing feedback to the DOC.
“I think we are benefiting more by just being there and listening and understanding that the folks across the table and in those small groups are human beings just like us,” he said. “After the first forum, I sat at a table, after just about everybody left with a warden, and I won’t out him, but he was in tears and talked about how much his decisions impact not just people in our care, but their families and their systems. That is culture change.”
Hoy said recommendations are being generated to change the operation of the DOC, but what is more fundamentally important to him is the department’s culture.
“If we don’t make sure to address the culture and how we treat people, making sure that everything we do is treating people with dignity and respect, it’s not going to matter if we bring the overhead time from 35 days on average down to 20 or whatever it might be,” he said.
He noted that those working in maximum security prisons and restrictive housing settings often experience aggression by residents, including bodily fluids thrown at correctional officers.
“I get a lot of pushback when I say, not letting anybody off the hook for it, but what are the conditions that we are creating that make it OK for a human being to do that to another human being?” He said. “That’s the culture that we have to address, and it’s not everywhere. I’m not up here to completely bash DOC. I mean, I’ll tell it like it is, but there are pockets [needing change].”
Hoy also asked for understanding on the difficulty of making changes in an organization with 10,000 staff, 70,000 in community supervision and over 23,000 incarcerated.
“There’s going to be challenges; there’s going to be gaps,” he said of the DOC. But he asked for understanding for the thousands of people who  work for  DOC “who  “are trying to help change lives.”

The last keynote speaker of the evening was David Ayala, executive director of the national organization of The Formerly Incarcerated Convicted People and Families Movement, a network of over 60 organizations.
Ayala talked about the work of EXPO as part of a national movement that centers leadership by the people directly affected by the carceral system, narrative story-telling,  fighting for systemic change and creating infrastructure for reentry.
He stressed the importance of telling success stories like Carlson’s journey to obtaining his law degree.
“We need to lift up stories like that,” he said, “… there are many Davids across this country.”
Ayala encouraged EXPO to work across state lines with similar organizations.
“You’re not alone,” he told the group.  “You are part of a rich, resilient national web — a movement that believes freedom is not just a word, but a living horizon where every person returning home is met with care, dignity, and possibilities.”

Martin Hickey (D-Albuquerque), left, and Rep. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) told Source recently they have already decided on legislation to address New Mexico’s medical malpractice laws. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also announced the issue will be on the call for the upcoming 30-day session. (Courtesy NM Legislature)State lawmakers and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham are promising to take a big swing to address the state’s doctor shortage at the upcoming legislative session, with medical malpractice reform at the center of expected debate come January. 
The governor told New Mexico In Focus in an interview that aired Friday that she would put medical malpractice on the call of the 30-day session. That means lawmakers will be able to debate and approve legislation on the topic at a session that is otherwise confined to budgetary matters.
Her office did not respond Monday to Source New Mexico’s request for more details about what reforms the governor wants to see. But several lawmakers recently gave Source a preview of legislation they intend to introduce when that issue comes up in January. 
New Mexico has among the highest rates of medical malpractice lawsuits in the country, and doesn’t limit punitive damages or attorneys’ fees. Advocacy groups and some lawmakers point to the high costs of medical malpractice insurance as a major factor driving doctors away from the state.
According to the New Mexico Medical Association, 248 doctors left the state between 2021 and 2024. A recent study from nonpartisan advocacy group Think New Mexico study says the state lacks more than 10,000 health care workers in a variety of specialties. 
Lawmakers from both parties have a variety of fixes they say they will introduce when the session kicks off on Jan. 20:
Cap punitive damages
State Sen. Martin Hickey (D-Albuquerque), a retired physician, told Source outside an interim legislative committee meeting last week in Albuquerque that lawmakers can’t continue with half-measures.
“I mean, this is the state not to go to. No one’s hiring,” he said of the doctor shortage. “The largest groups in Albuquerque haven’t hired anyone in two to three years because of the malpractice,” he said, though he noted another factor is that compensation has been relatively low in some specialty areas. 
Think NM: Address medical malpractice, licensing to lessen health care worker shortage

Hickey said he is working with some “interested parties” on drafting a bill with significant changes, though he declined to say exactly who, apart from Think New Mexico. He said they’re all tasked with answering this question: 
“Will a reform bill change the climate in New Mexico such that physicians feel it’s safe to practice here right now?” he said. “They don’t feel it’s safe to practice here, so they don’t come.”
One sure change in the bill, he said, would limit the amount of punitive damages awarded to plaintiffs and their lawyers who win medical malpractice litigation. 
Changes there include raising the standard of evidence plaintiffs’ lawyers have to meet for juries to consider awarding punitive damages, which are intended to punish gross negligence or deliberate harm. 
Under current law, the standard plaintiffs’ lawyers have to meet is “preponderance of the evidence,” a relatively low evidentiary standard. It means lawyers have only to prove that their case for punitive damages is more likely true than not true.
If juries determine that lawyers met that standard, they have no limit on the amount of punitive damages they can award. That has meant high-profile jury awards of tens of millions of dollars, including at a rural hospital in Gallup. 
Hickey said his bill will raise that standard, possibly to as high as “beyond a reasonable doubt,” which is the standard required to convict criminal defendants, and would also cap the amount of awardable punitive damages, he said. 
Thirty-two other states have higher legal standards than New Mexico, and 22 cap punitive damages, according to Think New Mexico.
‘The Michigan Model’
A self-described “geek” about medical malpractice reform, fellow Albuquerque Democratic state Rep. Marianna Anaya told Source that she’s convened a working group composed of doctors and trial lawyers that meets twice a week to “have actual human conversations with one another without degrading one another.”
She told Source she will introduce a bill creating a New Mexico version of the “Michigan Model” for malpractice claims.
The approach emphasizes quick acknowledgment of wrongdoing and compensation instead of long, drawn-out lawsuits. 
As Gallup hospital tries to mend financial wounds, it faces a $68 million judgment

Lawmakers on the Health and Human Services committee heard presenters from Michigan and the University of New Mexico Hospital describe the model as an antidote to the “deny and defend” approach New Mexico and other states currently have toward allegations of medical malpractice. 
One aspect of the legislation would ensure doctors could apologize to patients without incurring additional liability. Those laws adopted elsewhere make doctors or other medical professionals’ apologies after unexpected medical outcomes inadmissible in court. 
Experts last week presented evidence that patients feeling unheard or unseen after  poor medical outcomes can contribute to their pursuit of compensation in court. Enacting so-called “apology laws” as part of a more compassionate approach broadly could reduce the number of medical malpractice claims, Anaya said. 
“To me, that is a great uniter,” Anaya said. “Because if people are talking about lowering the number of lawsuits coming forward, this is proven to do that.”
Senate Bill 8
Recently, Republicans in the Legislature have hosted town halls and railed against Democrats’ inaction on medical malpractice. They also introduced reform legislation during the special legislative session earlier this month, but the bill was never heard due to the narrow agenda. 
Brandon Harris, a spokesperson for Senate Republicans, told Source on Monday that Republicans will likely re-introduce the bill in January. 
“Republicans would prefer a comprehensive bill (such as SB8 from the special session) to address multiple areas of concern with Medical Malpractice in New Mexico,” he wrote in an email. 
Five Senate Republicans sponsored the bill. It would cut down on trial lawyers bringing cases in other, potentially higher-paying judicial districts, a practice Think New Mexico called “venue shopping.” It would also ban lump-sum jury award payments in favor of payments made as expenses are incurred, and it would limit attorney fees, among other changes.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-13-at-2.25.31-PM-1024x625.png,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

Their mortgage was nearly paid off. The family had homeowners insurance, but their claim was denied.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided the Johns family with an award of $58,000, which helped with temporary housing needs. About $12,000 of that was designated for personal property replacement and about $42,000 was meant to replace their home.
“You can’t replace a home for $42,000,” Paul Reeves said at the Governor’s Advisory Committee on Western North Carolina Recovery meeting on Monday.
The family received $10,000 from a governor’s grant to prepare the site for rebuilding, according to Reeves, president and CEO of Habitat for Humanity of North Carolina.
Reeves’s organization is bringing in other funding sources to rebuild the Johns family’s home. The new foundation is in, the house is framed, and the Johns family expects to move in by early 2026.
“Just know that the on-the-ground dollars are making a difference and having a huge impact on the families that we serve,” Reeves said.
Habitat for Humanity and Baptists on Mission have used the governor’s grant funds to repair more than 500 homes in western North Carolina, according to Gov. Josh Stein at Monday’s meeting.
When people are waiting to get a roof over their heads, help can’t come fast enough, he said.
“It’s really great because, frankly, [the organizations] move faster than the federal government does,” Stein said. “They immediately stepped up and met the moment.”
But more than a year after Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc on western North Carolina, Stein said there’s still plenty to be done, and more funding is needed to make it happen.
Last month, Stein asked Congress and the Trump administration to send an additional $13.5 billion to North Carolina towards recovery from Helene.
With the federal shutdown headed into a third week, the governor said he’s urged the state’s congressional delegation to work across the aisle for a compromise.
“So far we have been able to maintain our recovery progress… but we cannot continue at this pace indefinitely without a functioning federal government,” Stein said.
Over 300 homeowners have submitted applications to FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program since February, but none have been approved, according to Stein.
This program acquires homes in flood prone areas so that residents can use the money to resettle and “move forward with their lives,” Stein said.
“My team and I are asking FEMA, ‘What is the holdup?’ We’re working hard to get some answers,” Stein said.
When he met with Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought during his trip to Washington in September, Stein asked him to exempt all disaster preparedness and recovery efforts in North Carolina from the ongoing shutdown. There’s no response yet.
Neither the White House nor western NC congressman Chuck Edwards (R-NC11) responded to requests for comment on Stein’s remarks.
While there’s still work to be done, the state has made progress over the past year, Stein’s staff shared at the meeting.
Residents have been approved for more than $524 million in FEMA individual assistance, and more than 6,800 households have received help with temporary housing, according to Matt Calabria, director of the Governor’s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina (GROW NC).
North Carolina is the fastest state in more than a decade to begin rebuilding homes after a major hurricane using funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grand Disaster Recovery program, Calabria shared.
More than 72,000 households have received food assistance and more than 10,000 households have received utility assistance, according to Calabria.
Additionally, families have received over 48,000 higher education scholarships and grants, and 318 public schools have received assistance to replace food and food-related equipment and supplies.
All 13 impacted state parks and five historic sites have reopened either partially or fully.
“It was an internal goal that we get all of these major state assets open for business once again by the one-year mark, which we’re glad to have done,” Calabria said. “This has a significant economic and tourism impact as well, so we’re very grateful for that.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3427-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

MOSCOW, IDAHO – The Rev. Tricia Tedrow was installed as pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Moscow at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at the church, 405 S. Van Buren St. She is the first woman to lead the congregation in its 145-year history.
Tedrow has been preaching and serving the community since August.
“It’s a celebration that the search process is over and we’ve found each other,” Tedrow said.
Mary Read, a church member, said the congregation is thrilled with the match.
“She’s the person who’s going to walk alongside the congregation,” Read said. “She’s very approachable, friendly and down to earth.”
 A path to ministry

Tedrow has served as pastor in churches from Northern Louisiana, Texas, Massachusetts and Arizona. She received a master’s of divinity from Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Austin, Texas, and went on to earn a doctorate in ministry from Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. She has served as an interim pastor, pastor and the Congregational Ministry Curriculum Manager on a national level.
“I know this part of the county, and I love this part of the country,” Tedrow said.

She completed her undergraduate degree in history at Whitworth University in Spokane. Tedrow said she had wanted to be a lawyer but while at her home church in New Mexico, she felt called to ministry.
“It’s not something I considered growing up, it wasn’t until after college I felt called,” Tedrow said.
The First Presbyterian Church of Moscow has had 27 pastors since it was founded in September 1880. The previous pastor, the Rev. Norman Fowler, served from October 2005 to May 2024. There were two interim pastors between Fowler’s retirement and Tedrow’s start, which was a husband and wife duo.
 Goals for the future

While Tedrow is the first woman to serve as pastor of the church, she said gender hasn’t been a focus for the congregation. Female pastors are common in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and Tedrow has been the first woman pastor at other congregations.
She said the congregation at First Presbyterian has been open and welcoming. Tedrow said she and the congregations have hopes to continue to strengthen their outreach to the community and revitalize the music program.
“We have hopes to continue to be a strong presence in the community,” Tedrow said.

,DC,2025-10-13 20:25:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Nutrition program for women, infants and children to stay afloat through end of month",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nutrition-program-women-infants-and-children-stay-afloat-through-end-month,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture is infusing $300 million into a key federal nutrition program to keep it running through October, while a government shutdown continues without an apparent end point. USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children — known as WIC — has relied on short-term funds amid the shutdown. That has worried advocates as states are left to fill the gaps when the money runs out. USDA is transferring $300 million into WIC from its child nutrition programs account, which has long been funded in part by tariff revenue from prior years, according to a congressional aide familiar with the plan. The transfer does not require congressional approval and is expected to keep the program afloat through the end of this month. A USDA spokesperson said in a statement to States Newsroom that the agency “will utilize tariff revenue to fund WIC for the foreseeable future,” though the spokesperson did not offer any specifics. President Donald Trump’s administration had announced the transfer last week but also did not provide much detail. “Our hope is that that money can just get released really swiftly and provide funds to states by next week to prevent further disruptions to WIC,” Georgia Machell, president and CEO of the National WIC Association, told States Newsroom. “Full funding for the program is still the priority here, and it’s great to have short-term solutions, but we need the long-term commitment from Congress to continue funding WIC on a bipartisan basis, which it’s done for decades,” added Machell, whose organization serves as the nonprofit advocacy voice and education arm of WIC. Dependent on congressional approvalThe program serves nearly 7 million people and offers “free healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and referrals to other services,” per USDA.But as a discretionary program, WIC is subject to congressional approval each year — making it particularly vulnerable to the ongoing funding lapse.With no funds so far congressionally appropriated for the program in fiscal 2026, which began Oct. 1, WIC has relied on several small pots of money in recent days to keep it running, including USDA’s $150 million contingency fund. States received allocations from that fund.Leftover money for the program from the prior fiscal year was also reallocated to states last week, and was expected to keep WIC operating for several more days. Members of the U.S. Senate were scheduled to vote Tuesday on a stopgap spending bill passed by the House that would reopen the government. But with no deal at hand, it was expected the legislation would again fail to win the support of the 60 senators needed.Senate rebuffs Trump budget cut for WICUSDA’s decision to use the tariff revenue came as Trump has sought to slash part of WIC’s funding in his fiscal 2026 budget request, including taking away “more than $1.3 billion in fruit and vegetable benefits from 5.2 million participants,” according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The full Senate passed its bipartisan bill dealing with Agriculture Department funding, including WIC, back in August. The measure fully funds the program for fiscal 2026 at $8.2 billion and “continues full funding for additional fruit and vegetable benefits,” according to Senate Appropriations Committee Democrats. Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee’s version of the bill, which passed out of the Republican-controlled panel in June, provides $7.5 billion for WIC, and includes a “10 percent cut in the cash value vouchers for fruits and vegetables for women and children,” according to the panel’s Democrats. Kate Scully, deputy director of WIC at the Food Research & Action Center, said “we’re still urging Congress to pass a full-year budget that provides WIC the funding it needs to serve everyone who’s eligible for the program and applies, and that includes keeping benefit levels where they are today.” Scully, whose national nonprofit works to reduce poverty-related hunger through research, advocacy and policy solutions, said “families should still utilize their benefits, go to scheduled appointments, but check with their state agency to see if there are any changes.” Scully said her organization is “hearing reports of some places closing,” but that might change with the $300 million infusion of funding. “So, certainly check with your state, but don’t not use your benefits or go to your appointments, because WIC should still be operational.”",,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Republican lawmakers in North Carolina plan to pass a new congressional map next week to help the GOP maintain its control over Congress in the 2026 midterm elections.
North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) announced an agreement between state House and Senate leaders to redraw the state’s congressional districts to yield an additional Republican representative from North Carolina.
“President Trump earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,” Hall said in a statement Monday.
There’s little to stand in their way. Passing a new congressional map requires only a simple majority vote in both chambers of the General Assembly, and Republicans hold majorities in both. The new districts are not subject to Stein’s veto. Judicial action is also unlikely, as both the U.S. Supreme Court and North Carolina Supreme Court have held that partisan gerrymandering falls outside of their purview.

Hall cited efforts by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to overturn independent maps in his state to create more Democratic seats, which itself came in response to redistricting at President Donald Trump’s urging in Texas and Missouri.
“Our state won’t stand by while Democrats like Gavin Newsom redraw districts to aid in their efforts to obtain a majority in the U.S. House,” Hall said. “We will not allow them to undermine the will of the voters and President Trump’s agenda.”
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) — who first floated the idea of a new map last month — said protecting Trump’s agenda requires “safeguarding Republican control of Congress.”
“Picking up where Texas left off, we will hold votes in our October session to redraw North Carolina’s congressional map to ensure Gavin Newsom doesn’t decide the congressional majority,” he said.
House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said in a statement that the Republican effort is tantamount to “stealing a congressional district.” He condemned the state GOP for making a rapid push for new maps while failing to fully fund Medicaid.
“Republican lawmakers made clear today that they plan to come back to Raleigh and disenfranchise the voters of this state,” Reives said. “Instead of lowering costs for families or ensuring Medicaid can stay afloat, they are hellbent on consolidating as much power as they can.”
North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton denounced Berger and Hall directly and said the redistricting effort was “corruption” aimed at shielding Trump from voter backlash.
“North Carolina Republicans Phil Berger and Destin Hall are weak, subservient cowards, willing to steamroll the people of our state so they can give Donald Trump what he wants — power without accountability,” she said. “Let me be clear: maps should not give you power; voters should.”
North Carolina’s Congressional Districts (Map: NCGA)
North Carolina’s congressional map already heavily favors Republicans, with 53% of the congressional vote giving Republicans a 10-4 majority in the House delegation. Only Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) holds a competitive seat, winning by less than 2% of the vote in the state’s 1st Congressional District in 2024.
The announcement comes weeks after a poll commissioned by Common Cause North Carolina found 84% of voters in the state oppose gerrymandering, including 78% of Republicans.
Melissa Price Kromm, chair of voter advocacy group North Carolina For The People, criticized the move as harmful to voters, calling instead for systemic reform and redistricting led by independent commissions.
“These new redistricting wars aren’t about fairness; they’re about power,” she said in a statement. “Every time politicians redraw maps to cling to power, trust in our democracy erodes.”
Kromm said “it’s telling” that House and Senate Republicans are able to come to a speedy agreement on redistricting while failing to pass a state budget. “They’re prioritizing power over people, again,” she said.
Stein said in September that the prospect of mid-decade redistricting in North Carolina is “ridiculous” and damaging to democracy.
“We just redistricted for the second time last cycle. So every two years is the theory that we’re gonna redistrict, so we can maximize the political advantage to stick it to one party and enhance another party?” Stein said. “We cannot get into this maximalist political power worldview because it will destroy this country.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)To celebrate Indigenous People’s Day, Democrats in the Wisconsin Assembly announced a package of bills Monday that would grant rights to Devil’s Lake State Park and reinstitute a law that effectively banned mining. 
The proposal to grant “rights of nature” to Wisconsin’s most popular state park comes just months after a group of Republicans introduced legislation that would prevent local governments in the state from enacting similar legislation. The Milwaukee County Board passed a rights of nature resolution promising to protect the Menominee, Milwaukee and Fox rivers and Lake Michigan. The Green Bay city council is also currently working on a rights of nature resolution. 
Under the bill, Devil’s Lake has the right to “flourish, evolve, and be clean.” The bill gives the state attorney general the authority to enforce the law against people who infringe on the park’s rights and allows anyone to sue or intervene in a lawsuit in the name of the park to enforce the park’s rights. Anyone who infringes on the park’s rights by damaging the environment will be liable to pay damages to restore the park to its previous state. 
In addition to the Devil’s Lake bill, the package includes a joint resolution acknowledging that “nature has inherent rights” and the state of Wisconsin “has a duty to uphold those rights as part of its enduring conservation legacy and its responsibility to future generations.” 
The resolution also states that the Legislature won’t pass laws preventing local rights of nature ordinances.
The Republican bill preempting local rights of nature efforts is “anti-free speech, it’s anti-democratic,” Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), one of the bills’ co-authors, told the Wisconsin Examiner. “Whereas our bill is, ‘Hey, let’s get this on the docket and actually have a productive conversation, actually bring in stakeholders about what it means to look at nature actually having rights.’”
Miresse said the more symbolic measures passed by local governments are important statements of values, but he wanted the bill to have “teeth.” 
“I would like to move beyond mission and vision statements. I think those are great for guiding principles and taking us in the right direction and keeping our mission and vision top of mind when we are creating and drafting policy at the local level. And I want to make sure they have a right to do that regardless of what the preemption bill would do,” Miresse said. “However, when we were looking at this in terms of crafting policy and changing statute, there would be some teeth here.”
Miresse said the bill is targeted only at Devil’s Lake, rather than all the bodies of water in Wisconsin, because it was simplest to start with a piece of nature that has defined political boundaries already under the state’s control. 
In their preemption bill, Republicans Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) argued that laws granting rights to nature posed a “dangerous shift in legal precedent” that would result in “threatening property rights, stalling development, and burdening the judicial system.”
Democrats counter that granting legal rights to a park or a body of water isn’t much different than granting First Amendment rights to a corporation — which Republicans successfully argued for in court cases such as Citizens United. 
Also announced Monday is a proposal to reinstate Wisconsin’s “prove it first” mining law, which requires that in order to obtain a permit from the Department of Natural Resources, mining companies must prove the mine can be operated for 10 years and be shuttered for 10 years without harmful effects on the local environment. The law was enacted in 1997 until Republicans repealed it in 2017. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, authored the bill to repeal the mining ban when he was in the state Senate. 
This year, a Canadian company has begun exploratory drilling projects in the state, potentially leading to the first operating mines in Wisconsin for the first time in decades. 
Miresse said he wants decisions about mining to consider local environmental health rather than just being about “dollars and cents.”

Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, sent a letter Sunday to the Board of Regents asking the body to join the Compact for Excellence in Higher Education, developed by President Donald Trump and his administration, “as soon as possible.”
“Iowa has a chance to be a leader in higher education reform by having our universities be the first to sign on to this compact,” the letter stated.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Board of Regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email the board received the letter from Collins and Evans and is reviewing the compact.
Published in its entirety by the Washington Post, the compact lists the benefits the higher education system receives from its “extraordinary relationship with the U.S. government,” including direct and indirect research funding, student loans, grant funding and other contracts, approval of visas for students and university officials, and “preferential treatment under the tax code.”
Universities that do not wish to follow the eight rules of the compact — which span admissions, hiring, discourse on campus, finances and more — do not have to, the compact document stated, “if the institution elects to (forgo) federal benefits.”
The compact directs universities to not allow demographics like “sex, ethnicity, race, nationality, political views, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious associations, or proxies for any of those factors” to impact student admission or hiring decisions, unless excused by federal law or exempted by the fact that an institution is religious or single-sex.
Colleges that opt in to the compact would have to freeze tuition for five years, according to the document, and disclose any and all foreign funding. Institutions would not be allowed to have more than 15% of their undergraduate student body come through the Student Visa Exchange Program, of which no one country can represent more than 5% of the population.
Other rules of the compact include committing to institutional neutrality and ensuring “no single ideology” is dominant on campus by having varying viewpoints by “revising governance structures as necessary.” The compact also directs universities to grade and discipline students equally, and define “male” and “female” by “reproductive function and biological processes.”
“These common sense reforms would not only be welcome news for Iowa students and taxpayers, but joining this compact would greatly benefit Iowa’s universities by giving them preferred access to federal funding,” Collins’ and Evans’ letter stated.
Universities in the compact would be required to conduct an annual poll of students and staff to “evaluate the university’s performance against this compact,” the document stated, and results will be published online. The U.S. Department of Justice will oversee the compact, and universities found in violation will lose access to its benefits for one year, to start.
Multiple universities have already stated they will not join the compact, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — one of nine institutions specifically invited to sign on.
The American Council on Education, American Association of Colleges and Universities and Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges have also released statements saying the compact threatens university independence and academic freedom.

(Photo by Lidija Kamansky/Getty Images)With fall weather dampening wildland fire conditions in Washington, officials are beginning to reflect on the fire season. 
Washington state saw more individual fires than last season, but fewer acres burned, preliminary data shows. Several sizable fires are still burning. 
As of Oct. 10, there were 251,840 acres burned in Washington state and 1,851 documented ignitions, according to Northwest Interagency Coordination Center data released by the state Department of Natural Resources. 
The data is not specific to Department of Natural Resources-managed lands, and encompasses wildland fire activity across all of Washington state. 
The numbers include the current acreage for the two fires still burning in Central Washington, as well as several other active fires across the state. 
The Labor Mountain fire and the Lower Sugarloaf fire in Central Washington were both partially contained as of Monday afternoon. 
The Bear Gulch fire in the Olympic National Forest is also still burning, but fire management personnel determined last week that the threat of further damage from the fire is minimal. The Tunnel Creek fire, similarly, has mostly stopped growing due to the shift in weather. 
The total acreage burned so far this year is below last year’s total of 274,593 acres and the five-year average of 423,436 acres. 
“Unless something unexpected happens, Washington state will likely experience slightly fewer or a similar number of total acres burned statewide as last year,” said Department of Natural Resources spokesperson Thomas Kyle-Milward
Fire ignitions, however, are higher than last year’s total of 1,806 and the five-year average of 1,629. 
Ignitions include anything that starts a fire, such as weather, human activity, and undetermined causes. False alarm reports are not included in the data. 
Kyle-Milward described this year’s wildland fire season as “average to above-average,” noting that fire activity was consistent with projections for the season. 
Finalized data for 2025 will be released in January. 
With temperatures mellowing and rain beginning to fall, the Department of Natural Resources does not expect any further fire activity in Central and Eastern Washington this season. 
“Fall weather is mitigating conditions,” said Kyle-Milward. 
Because conditions have become favorable, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife announced last week that it plans to start conducting prescribed burns on the lands it manages in Eastern Washington. 
The agency conducts prescribed fires during conditions that favor low-intensity burning, such as in the spring and fall, to improve ecosystem health and reduce the risk for future catastrophic wildfires. 
“Fire rejuvenates important native grass and brush favored by deer and elk, as well as small mammals and bird species, while providing improved ecosystem health and resiliency, reduced wildfire intensity, and improved access for recreational users,” said Matt Eberlein, prescribed fire program manager with the Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
The agency plans to treat 300 acres on the L.T. Murray Unit of the L.T. Murray Wildlife Area about 15 miles west of Ellensburg. It will also partner with Chelan County, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Washington Department of Natural Resources to treat 36 acres in the Stemilt Basin in the Colockum Wildlife Area.
Additional burns on Department of Fish and Wildlife-managed Eastern Washington lands may be announced later this fall. 
All burns are weather-dependent and will not occur if conditions are not optimal for safe and effective prescribed fires, Fish and Wildlife stated. 
The Department of Natural Resources launched its own prescribed fire program in 2021, when state lawmakers approved a bill committing $500 million over eight years  for wildfire preparedness and response. 
State spending largely kept up with that target until this year. 
The Department of Natural Resources was adequately prepared for this year’s fire season, but used funding left over from previous years to do so. 
Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who oversees the department, is asking the Legislature to backfill $60 million for fire prevention efforts, including tree thinning and prescribed burns, that was shortchanged in the last legislative session. 
He is also asking for an additional $44.8 million for wildfire fighting for the 2026 fiscal year, which runs through next June.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cedar-creek-fire-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 16:57:17.853918

When neighbors start going hungry and local businesses are threatened, Brighid sets to investigating the club’s charismatic developer, coming up against crooked cops, greedy politicians, and a string of increasingly depraved deceptions—all while struggling to cope with the deployment of her wife, Major Sarah Ann (“Sam”) Musgrave. With help from attorney Morgan Harmon and the FBI, Brighid must uncover the scheme defrauding her community of millions, even if it puts her own life on the line.
Stolen Mountain is available October 21st in bookstores everywhere.
Reader: I.M., thanks for chatting with me. Where did the idea for Stolen Mountain come from?
Aiken: I watched the brewing of two large fraud cases in Vermont in recent decades: one in Wilmington and Dover, and the other near the Canadian border at Jay Peak. From an outsider’s perspective, it seemed as if the cases were unrelated, but the similarities were striking. Two Vermont ski areas, efforts to steal funds from local citizens and businesses, influencing state officials with tax programs and photo-ops, and other tricks common to the fraudster’s toolkit.
As I researched one case, facts from the other case would bleed in. I used the stillness of the pandemic year to travel to these projects, interviewing victims, studying local documents and newspapers, and photographing the sites. 
Stolen Mountain focuses primarily on the case involving Haystack Mountain, and the developers of The Hermitage Club. Haystack was a small and private ski area in Wilmington and Dover. The vision of The Hermitage, as explained in the local papers, was to create an exclusive resort for wealthy patrons who would fly in and out of a local airport. But the locals paid a hefty price.
Reader: “Ripped from the headlines,” as they say?
Aiken: Inspired, yes. Faithful to the facts? No. Stolen Mountain is fiction, because if I stuck with the facts, my readers would hate me. Fraud is actually very boring and predictable. Con cons locals and politicians with grand ideas, gets great deals, starts doing things, then “forgets” to pay bills. The bad guy decides he’s too big to fail and the local economy is suddenly dependent on his project, employment scheme, and investment. The real bad guy simply walked away with the money. In my book, I am just not that forgiving. There are a few fun twists and turns. 
Reader: Your main character, Brighid, is a lot of fun to read. Tell me about her. This isn’t the first time your loyal readers will meet her, is it?
Aiken: I wanted to expand on two of my favorite secondary characters from my previous novel The Little Ambulance War of Winchester County, released last year. Our hero, Brighid, is an advanced EMT and captain on the rescue squad in her fictitious town of Trowbridge, Vermont. She comes with classic Yankee moxie and keeps getting interrupted by 911 calls. Her wife, Sam, is a career army officer. For those in the know, I have been publishing short stories monthly on Substack, where readers can get to know Brighid, Sam, and the Trowbridge rescue squad. The stories are free. You can find them here: https://TrowbridgeDispatch.IamAiken.com. Each story stands alone and can be read in any order. I just keep writing about the same people in the same places while ignoring timelines.
Reade: So tell me more about the plot of Stolen Mountain. Obviously, Brighid is investigating this big fraud. What else is going on?
Aiken: Twenty years ago, I reported for duty at the military base in Killeen, Texas, the then-home of the U.S. Army’s 4th Infantry Division. I was a civilian assigned into a military unit as a subject matter expert. My boss was a major, and together we managed a platoon of fifteen soldiers and one coast guard member. When I was deployed overseas, the military had already dismissed nearly 5,000 service members for being queer. The timeline of the original Hermitage fraud case straddled the reversal of “Don’t Ask-Don’t Tell,” so the discrimination against queer soldiers is woven tightly into the novel. Of course, when drafting this work, I assumed that these days were behind us. Suddenly, exploring queer folks in public service and military roles seems contemporary.
Also, I questioned why Vermont was a target for two large fraud cases that related to land, development, and ski areas. Although I offer no blame, I did explore how Vermont reviews and approves development projects. We run them through environmental reviews during the permitting process. While writing, I researched how Vermont investigates financial crimes. I didn’t find much.
I wonder if financial integrity ought to be as important as environmental planning. As a novelist, I can explore these questions freely (I hope, still).
And because I have been in public service since my teen years, I’ve tossed in my normal 911 and rescue squad antics and drama. Bringing the spice to everyday community heroes we find in Vermont towns.
Reader: Where can readers find the book?
Aiken: It will be available at any bookstore from October 21st. I have a funny feeling that booksellers near Jay Peak and The Hermitage Club will have abundant inventory. I encourage folks to buy the audiobook, which is read by me. It can be found on Libro.fm or any other place where audiobooks are sold.

Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law that will ban food containing some artificial food dyes from being sold in West Virginia starting on Jan. 1, 2028. (Leann Ray | West Virginia Watch)The International Association of Color Manufacturers is suing West Virginia health and school leaders over a new state law that bans certain artificial food dyes from being included in food items sold in school lunches. 
The group is asking a judge to strike down the requirement. 
Republican lawmakers behind the bill, which passed earlier this year, said the synthetic red, blue, green and yellow dyes — commonly in candy, cereal and soda — are unnecessary and harmful. Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the measure into law in March. 
In the lawsuit, the association says the West Virginia Legislature acted unlawfully in passing House Bill 2354 by asserting their power over the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has the authority to make food safety decisions. 
The suit was filed Oct. 6 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the state’s health secretary, Arvin Singh, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt and state school board members by name. West Virginia Bureau for Health Interim Commissioner Justin Davis was also named as a defendant. 
“By expressly naming and prohibiting the targeted color additives without any rational basis for finding that they are, in fact, unsafe in any way, HB 2354 violates the equal protection guarantees under the U.S. and West Virginia Constitutions,” the lawsuit said. “The Court should declare the law unconstitutional and enjoin its enforcement.”
The legislation banned the use of seven artificial dyes — Red No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2 and Green No. 3 — in school meals beginning Aug. 1 and is currently being implemented in schools statewide. Some lawmakers linked the dyes to behavioral issues in children. 
The dyes would be prohibited along with the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben, in drugs and food items for sale in the state beginning Jan. 1, 2028.
Morrisey and other Republican supporters of the bill have linked to the Trump administration’s “Make American Healthy Again” movement. Shortly after the legislation passed in West Virginia, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his intention for the country’s food industry to phase out artificial dyes. They want the industry to swap out the dyes for natural alternatives.
But IACM maintains that there’s no scientific evidence showing that the dyes are harmful when consumed. The group’s website includes information on why colors are safe and how they’re regulated, saying the color additives are subject to extensive safety assessment as described by the FDA.
In the lawsuit, IACM also said that manufacturers of color additives and manufacturers of products which use those additives “will suffer irreparable harm, both through the deprivations of their constitutional protections as well as the significant economic costs that the law will impose on them.”
Before lawmakers signed off on the bill, the state’s food and beverage industry pushed back on the measure with paid advertisements, warning that it would lead to increased grocery prices and empty shelves. Alternative ingredients don’t exist to scale, they said.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)About three dozen people gathered under cloudy skies at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque Monday morning to see the first traditional dance performances for Indigenous Peoples Day.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2019 declared the second Monday in October Indigenous Peoples Day, and an official state holiday.
The Pueblo Dance Group, which includes members from the Pueblos of Laguna, Acoma, Zuni and Hopi Tribe, opened the celebration Monday morning. One of the group’s founders’ Chris Charlie (Laguna Pueblo) noted the group performed at the International Balloon Fiesta earlier in the week and would be heading for New York City for another performance this month.
‘We’re here to entertain you guys and bless you,” Charlie said to the crowd of about three dozen assembled to watch the dances.
In Santa Fe, the celebration began over the weekend, with dancers from numerous tribes leading into a Monday Honoring Native Nations Powwow on the Plaza.

Kathryn Keyope (Acoma Pueblo) told Source NM that the holiday provided an opportunity to bring “a little bit more awareness… just to spread knowledge [and] bring a …awareness to everybody around us that comes to visit. We are getting a lot more non-Natives who come and watch us perform, so we definitely appreciate that they enjoy seeing us keeping our roots.”
Her husband Johnathan Keyope noted that they are able to share that history not just with visitors to New Mexico, but in other communities as well. “Some of the areas when we perform back east, local tribes are just far and few in between. So it’s great that we can share ourselves…to educate and to give everyone awareness and knowledge that we’re still here, and we do this; to  let people know of our beautiful history and our beautiful culture.”









 The Pueblo Dance Group was founded nearly 10 years ago, by Chris Charlie (Laguna Pueblo) this Christmas and includes dancers and singers from various Pueblos and tribal nations in New Mexico. 










 Marcy Quam, 69, and husband Delbert Quam drove two and half hours from Zuni Pueblo to watch their son perform with the Pueblo Dance Group. ‘It’s important for us Indigenous people to come together and celebrate our day, we can enjoy watching our family, seeing the dances,’ Marcy Quam said.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)MEDORA, N.D. – Public lands advocate Walt Dabney joined a group of North Dakota conservationists in the Badlands on Sunday to see how federal funding cuts are affecting public lands in the state — and how members of the public are stepping up in the government’s place.
Dabney, a former National Park Service ranger, is in North Dakota this week to deliver a series of talks about the importance of public lands and conservation. 
His career included stints at Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Yosemite, Grand Teton, Everglades and Mount Rainier, eventually serving as superintendent and chief ranger of the National Park Service. But until Sunday, he had never been hiking in the North Dakota Badlands.
Dabney, 79, retired from the U.S. National Park Service in 2010 after 43 years of service. He now spends his time advocating for the National Park System.
He said he’s worried about the future of the parks.
Federal agencies like the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have had their staffs reduced under the Trump administration. Thousands of remaining workers are on furlough during the ongoing government shutdown.
As a result, there are fewer people taking care of the trails.

Conservationists on the hike pointed out several areas where deferred maintenance on federal land — like unaddressed erosion — made it harder and less safe to traverse.
But Dabney’s hosts were proud to show him a new bridge on the 144-mile Maah Daah Hey Trail. The wooden bridge, which crosses Bear Creek and was installed in July, replaced an old one that had collapsed after a storm in 2023.
The project was a team effort between Dakota Prairie Grasslands staff, conservation groups and volunteers. 
Dakota Prairie Grasslands applied to get a mule train to get materials to the bridge site. Staff also borrowed equipment from the state of North Dakota to reroute part of the trail to the new bridge.
The combined support allowed Dakota Prairie Grasslands workers to complete the project in a matter of days rather than months.
“What Walt talks about in his talk, this is a great example of that,” Shannon Straight, executive director of the Badlands Conservation Alliance, said during the hike.
Dabney said the purpose of his tour is to educate the public about the origin of the National Park System, what parks offer the American public and why he thinks they must be protected.

He said his talk is partly a response to efforts to transfer federal land to states.
As part of this movement, Utah along with a group of other Republican-led state last year sued the federal government over millions of acres of public land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
Dabney will be delivering three talks in North Dakota: one Tuesday evening at Dickinson State University’s Beck Auditorium, another Wednesday evening at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck and the last on Thursday evening University of North Dakota’s Gorecki Alumni Center in Grand Forks.
Dabney said he’s using his voice in part because federal park workers can’t. Mass layoffs and funding cuts in the executive branch have made it so that rank-and-file park federal employees are afraid to express themselves, he said.
He urged them to keep a low profile so they have a chance to keep their jobs. The federal government needs to retain employees who care about public lands, he said.
“Do your job, take care of each other, take care of the visitor,” he said. “You can only fall on your sword once.”



Walt Dabney will visit three North Dakota cities this week. The public events start at 6:30 p.m. with a film, followed by a question-and-answer segment with Dabney. 
The dates and locations are:

Tuesday at Dickinson State University’s Beck Auditorium
Wednesday at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck
Thursday at the University of North Dakota’s Gorecki Alumni Center in Grand Forks

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Today is Native Americans’ Day in South Dakota, which is described in state law as a legal holiday “dedicated to the remembrance of the great Native American leaders who contributed so much to the history of our state.”
Gov. George S. Mickelson and the Legislature created the annual holiday in 1990. They chose the second Monday in October, which is federally designated as Columbus Day. The effort was part of a broader Year of Reconciliation proclaimed by Mickelson at the urging of Native American newspaper publisher Tim Giago.
The following is an excerpt from a speech that Mickelson delivered Oct. 8, 1990, at Crazy Horse Memorial on South Dakota’s first Native Americans’ Day. He began by speaking in Lakota, and then provided the English translation for the traditional greeting:

Today, I stand before for you and shake your hand with a happy heart. And today that really takes on extra meaning as we stand here and make history.
Chief Standing Bear made a statement long ago that became the theme of the Council for Reconciliation. It is hard for us to imagine, but it was the attitude in 1879 that it had to legally be decided in this country, in this nation, whether or not Indians were people under the law, in the context of an issue that was being decided at that time.

And there was a judge by the name of [Elmer] Dundy who was sitting in judgment on Chief Standing Bear when Chief Standing Bear made a point that is the theme for the year of reconciliation. And what Standing Bear told Judge Dundy was, “My hand is not the color of your hand, but if you pierce it, I shall feel the pain. The blood that will flow from mine will be the same color as yours. I am a man. The Great Spirit made us both.”
The Great Spirit made us both. That concept is what Native American Day is all about. The Great Spirit made us, but years of turmoil, years of misunderstanding, years of mistrust have built walls between us and have made separate nations within the same state.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I’m not so naive to believe — and I know that you aren’t either — that we can turn back the clock of history by a hundred years and undo those things that have gone on in the past.
But what this day represents, and what we can do, is both turn to the future together and face it. We can reason together. We can negotiate. We can reach deep into our hearts for compassion. We can reach down and have a better understanding and trust of each other, and we can make a better life for ourselves and our children.
The most important thing to remember about today is that it is just a beginning. It is a foundation upon which to build friendship and trust.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_1566-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 15:57:24.266942

Bailey’s passion for emergency response began with a childhood moment in a firefighter’s helmet. From Junior Firefighter to EMT, he’s built his skills, with the help of leadership training. Now, he’s working toward a career as a firefighter—driven by purpose, community, and the joy of inspiring the next generation.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Answerin[...]","Bailey Shepard vividly remembers the sense of belonging he felt the first time he put on a firefighter’s helmet. It was a weekend day, and his family was at the Berlin Mall. Out in the parking lot, the fire department had brought trucks and tankers for kids to see up close. Bailey eagerly slipped on a firefighter’s coat and helmet. “It felt amazing,” he recalled. “I still have a picture of that. I instantly knew that’s where I belonged.”
Many departments allow recruits as young as 16. “I joined the minute I could,” he said. Bailey showed up at the Wolcott Volunteer Fire Department, ready to work as a Junior Firefighter.
“Junior means you’re the gofer, getting things from the truck,” he explained. Bailey spent those first two years hauling equipment and learning the ropes before earning his spot as a Senior Firefighter. “Senior Firefighters are more involved in the scene. It could be anything from a smoke detector going off with nothing happening to an emergency response for a flood.”
Learning leadership
A few years before he was able to join the fire department, Bailey attended a SEEDS leadership retreat at Vermont State University Lyndon. Offered by VSAC, the SEEDS Training Leadership Program focuses on building skills like teamwork and resilience. It was through SEEDS that Bailey was motivated to keep building his abilities—and his confidence. 
“SEEDS training inspired me quite a bit,” Bailey said. “A lot of leadership is needed in firefighting and EMS work. In EMS you’re the one in charge of a patient. That program helped me build more leadership skills.”
Bailey’s VSAC outreach program counselors, Michelle Legere and Lindsay Carpenter, worked with him through high school, helping him plan for a possible pathway to college. For a while Bailey thought he might go into music education—he played trombone and several other instruments—but eventually his passion for emergency response took over. While in high school, he also completed construction technology training at Green Mountain Technology & Career Center, earning certifications and credits that gave him options after graduation. 
“He is such a helper,” noted Michelle. “He’s been a devoted volunteer and community member from day one. I remember these business cards he made, advertising Bailey’s Helping Service. It really speaks to who he is, this great person who is always there and always helping others.”

Flood response, a defining moment
In July 2023 (as with many of his fellow first responders) Bailey found himself swimming through floodwater, checking on stranded vehicles. The night started with a call about a tree on a powerline and escalated as the storms overwhelmed local rivers. “You never know what’s coming,” Bailey said. “The whole night, we must have had twelve or more calls… that’s a lot for a volunteer department.”
In one case, a propane tank floated downriver, propelled near a home by the raging waters. Bailey suited up in full gear with a self-contained breathing apparatus to make sure the scene was safe.
That December, there was another flood in Wolcott. Bailey and another firefighter swam through the Lamoille River to reach a car stuck on Elmore Pond Road. “Someone came to the fire station saying there was a car flagging people down for help. We responded. I went in with someone else—we had to swim through the water to go rescue them.”
The floods were a landmark moment for Bailey and stand out to this day as his “why”: it’s the response work that resonates most with him and fuels his passion. Each call brings a different challenge; “You never know if it’s a stubbed toe or a house fully on fire,” he says. 
Answering the call
Three and a half years into firefighting, Bailey earned his EMT license and added ambulance calls to his schedule. “I knew I wanted that,” he says. After a free EMT class, he joined Hardwick Rescue, where he’s now volunteered for almost two years. He also serves with Woodbury Fire & Rescue, which covers both fire and EMS.
All of this work is carried out by volunteers. “Radios and pagers are always on me. Phone too. For Hardwick Rescue I have shifts. Woodbury I’m always on call,” Bailey said. “But we’re volunteers, and some days we don’t have coverage, and the call goes to a different department, further away. We’re always recruiting more people. We need them.”
On top of his two volunteer roles, Bailey works full time as crew at Smugglers’ Notch Resort, doing maintenance and a variety of support tasks.
Looking ahead
Today, Bailey’s goal is clear: he hopes to turn his volunteer service into a full-time career as a firefighter and EMT. “I’d love to do it full time. I’m just waiting for one to open up somewhere,” he says.
Through it all, he credits the support and leadership development he received from his VSAC Outreach Counselors and the SEEDS program. “A big part of the job is taking charge in emergency response situations. I use those leadership skills I built with VSAC almost every day,” he shared.
And even after long nights and unpredictable calls, Bailey still finds his greatest joy in sharing the excitement with kids. “It’s the best feeling in the world,” he said. “Showing a kid around a fire truck, in the back of an ambulance, putting the helmet on them. Their smiles are so big. If you have tough days, that’s what you have to go do.” It’s a full-circle moment for Bailey, whose own path began with that same early encounter.

The state’s Democrats in the same budget also embraced Trump’s no tax on tips, overtime and Social Security platform, which was enshrined in the current 2025-26 fiscal year budget.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed the multi-pronged spending plan last week, a full seven days past the start of the current fiscal year.
Whitmer signs $81B budget for Fiscal Year 2026, including funding for road fixes and public schools

Among the flurry of budget pieces signed by Whitmer was House Bill 4961, one of several tax generating bills separate from the packages that drove most of the negotiations. The legislation combined the tax decoupling component and the policy for “no tax on” tips, overtime and Social Security.
The move to sever Michigan’s tax rules means new money for roads and the state avoiding a giant revenue hole. But some businesses might end up paying more in state taxes and find themselves burdened by a confusing system, according to business groups that opposed the decoupled tax aspect of the new fiscal year budget.
That said, at least one economic expert told Michigan Advance that the notion of decoupling was a radical new step for Michigan.
“I think it’s important to point out that there are several what we call static states, and they don’t necessarily follow whatever the IRS passes in a given budget year, unless they specifically pass their own law affirming that they are going to do that, and so Michigan is one of them,” said Tyler Theile, vice president and director for public policy with East Lansing-based Anderson Economic Group. “So, it would be false to think, ‘oh, the majority of states are all following this tax code, and now Michigan is very, very unique that we’ve decoupled.’ That’s not really the case.”
Businesses who partner with universities might have a tougher time, however.
Trump’s tax plan upended Michigan budget talks
In the heat of Michigan’s budget standoff, which lasted months and featured a very public fight with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), the Democratic Senate held numerous committees examining the downstream effects of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those conversations flipped the table on the federal revenue question.
Trump’s legislation made significant federal tax changes, all hailed by Republicans as ways to grow the national economy, with a large emphasis on boosting research and development through modified expense and deduction rules. It also made Trump’s 2017 federal tax cuts permanent as they were set to expire at the end of this year.
Michigan has a flat income tax rate unlike the federal government’s progressive rate, but the two tax codes long mirrored each other for the sake of simplicity. The relationship meant some anticipated Trump’s tax relief to trickle down. Trump’s tax plan would have ultimately let businesses pay an estimated $680 million in fewer Michigan taxes, one of the revenue holes Democrats spent months warning about.
Revenue maintained by breaking the state and federal tax link will start hitting Michigan coffers in the current fiscal year, starting with $688 million in 2025-26, and escalating to $1.04 billion in the 2029-30 fiscal year.
Halting some federal tax effects flipped the revenue table, again
House Bill 4961, now Public Act 24 of 2025, alters the way federal income tax is calculated at the state level, and some new sections of the federal tax code modified by Trump’s plan will either be outright disregarded or shifted.
The most impactful changes govern depreciation for qualified property to spur capital investments through construction; another restoring current or two-year out deductions on domestic research and development; and others dealing with interest on non-cash, pre-tax or pre-depreciation expenses.
Several business groups opposed Michigan’s tax changes to serve a balanced budget, including the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, which produced an analysis of the anticipated impacts.
In the chamber’s view, breaking the link between the state and federal codes could very well impose an up to $2 billion tax hike on business over the next five years. The move also creates a more complex and confusing tax environment, which the chamber believed would be detrimental for Michigan employers.
Some have argued that new rules only offset Trump’s reforms by a few years as a transition period, and that it was simply a timing change. Not so, in the chamber’s view.
“Unless Michigan law is changed, this decoupling is permanent, leaving Michigan companies paying higher state taxes while competitors in neighboring states continue to benefit from these reforms,” the chamber wrote.
The business group said it was probing state lawmakers to see where changes could be made and if they were open to restoring alignment with Trump’s tax plans.
Whitmer embraces Trump’s ‘no tax on’ mantra
Shoehorned into Public Act 24 are three tax carveouts that Republicans and Trump have been championing since 2024 – zero taxes on tips, overtime pay and social security.
Among the “now tax on” mantras’ biggest supporters were Hall and state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee. When the budget deal emerged, the concept gained another key supporter: the Democratic governor of Michigan.
In a news release announcing that she signed the budget, and with zero line item vetoes, Whitmer highlighted the new tax aspects as a win for Michiganders. Later in the week, Whitmer’s office put out a second news release heralding what has been a major Trump Republican talking point.
“By ending taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security, we’re putting money back in the pockets of hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, so they can pay the bills and put food on the table,” Whitmer said.

A breakdown from Whitmer’s executive office said that 300,000 residents could save an average of $400 on their state taxes from no tax on tips, or $1,500 a year when combined with Trump’s no tax on tips at the federal level.
No taxes on overtime could save up to 500,000 Michigan workers an average of $500 a year in state taxes, or $2,000 when combined with the federal analog.
Eligible senior citizens collecting social security payments could also save an average of $500 a year in taxes. Whitmer’s team did not break down the federal social security tax savings in its analysis.
Hall, in a news conference last week giving his post-mortem take on the budget process, similarly hailed the inclusion of the Republican “no tax on” deals.

Process changes could be the biggest new tax hurdle
Theile told the Advance that the biggest burden facing businesses would likely appear in the process of filing, and not necessarily in the tax benefits they might not get.
“You need to keep track of it a little bit differently,” Theile said. “That’s always problematic when policy is put into place that creates extra steps that are tedious or confusing.”
It also opens the door for error, and those errors could be expensive.
Some legislators have said the decoupling change was meant to give Michigan some time to before the immediate changes took hold. Theile said she hopes that was true, because the research and development impact could be pronounced and was one to watch down the road.
“What we do really need in Michigan is to appear as competitive among peer states,” she said. “One of the ways we know we need to work hard in doing that is by encouraging businesses to spend on R&D and innovation, and to partner with our research universities on innovation.”
Theile said Michigan has shown progress meeting that goal, but the state still has a disproportionate number of highly educated, highly technical young people leaving.
“Part of that is because we don’t have the business investment and infrastructure capital here that creates angel investment pipelines, or other types of really innovation focused pipelines,” she said. “We can’t afford to fall any further behind.”
Awkward conversations abound as election cycle looms
Both sides of the political aisle in Michigan netted clear political wins in the state’s budget battle, but they could also take heavy punches on the areas where they caved. The tax implications of the state budget may drive some of the discontent, aside from the controversial 24% wholesale tax on marijuana sales, which is now the subject of a court battle and much dissension in the cannabis community.
Whitmer signs $81B budget for Fiscal Year 2026, including funding for road fixes and public schools

Adrian Hemond, CEO of the Grassroots Midwest political consulting firm, told the Advance that Republicans who voted for the tax changes should expect some questions.
“There was not really any consultation with the business community about this, particularly, our businesses that are super capital and research intensive that we’re looking forward to and planning for tax relief at the state level,” Hemond said. “This was sort of sprung on them at the last minute. … They could look forward to this tax relief in an accelerated fashion, because we were coupled to the feds. Now they’re not going to get that.”
Hemond said that Republicans who traditionally look to the business community for funding might have some uncomfortable conversations ahead.
Hall blamed Democrats for the changes in the tax rules in a news conference last week, but the bill was notably introduced by Bollin, and the decoupling aspect was not put into the bill by any late-game amendment from the Senate. 
For Democrats, staving off the worst effects of Trump’s tax cuts might help them polish their anti-Trump resumes, Hemond said.
To the talking point that the change was permanent and not simply a timing shift, Hemond said that the latter was true – but only if you’re not a business owner who was planning on new tax relief for months on end.
“It’s costing you a lot of money in the short term,” he said. “Whether you think the chamber is right here or not, it’s objectively true that any further business tax relief to spur investment, you’re not going to take advantage of that unless you have a big political fight in Lansing to try and win it [back].”
As for Whitmer and the Democrats’ group hug around “no tax on” tips, etc., Hemond believed that would be a far less bitter pill to swallow.
“The budget process is always a negotiation,” he said. “This is something that Republicans clearly wanted and there’s not a political cost to Democrats giving it to them. There’s objectively a cost to the state budget. Republicans can certainly claim it as a win, because for Republicans who have to face a primary election, they are hewing to the sort of line of the president.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1359673653-scaled-1-1024x573.jpg,,,2025-10-13 15:57:24.266942

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill filed Monday by state Rep. Tom Fabricio would require teachers to take an oath to the Constitution and nonpartisanship.
The bill, HB 147, would require teachers to, “before entering upon the duties of a classroom teacher,” take the oath.
The language is similar to oaths taken by lawyers, doctors, and public officials.
Fabricio, R-Miami Lakes, is an attorney and has been in office since 2020.



Proposed oath
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect, and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and the Constitution and Government of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified for employment as a classroom teacher in this state; that I will well and faithfully perform the duties of a classroom teacher in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner; that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students, which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.”			


Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas sent a letter last month to superintendents after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated. That letter targeted teachers’ social media conduct that he deemed “despicable” and “vile, sanctionable behavior.”

The Legislature and governor in the past few years have also passed laws making illegal teaching about “divisive concepts” and “identity politics.”
Fabricio does not sit on any education committees. He is vice chair of the Ways & Means Committee and sits on the Judiciary Committee, Rules & Ethics Committee, Information Technology Budget & Policy Subcommittee, Natural Resources & Disasters Subcommittee, and the Transportation & Economic Development Budget Subcommittee.
Chapter 876 of Florida statutes require state employees, including those serving on school boards and working for state or county school districts, to take an oath that they are a citizen of Florida and to support the U.S. and Florida constitutions.
Other states require oaths to federal and state constitutions, including California, Georgia, and New York. According to Encyclopedia.com, almost two-thirds of states since 1863 have adopted teacher loyalty oaths.

The LSU Presidential Search Committee earlier this month announced it would complete its task in time for the Board of Supervisors’ Oct. 24 meeting. It has now slowed down the process so board members can visit the White House Oct. 20 to celebrate LSU’s national baseball championship. 
The search committee will now meet Oct. 23 to  determine which candidates will be invited to formally apply for the president’s job. Members will meet again Oct. 29 to publicly interview the candidates and select three finalists. 
Those finalists will then meet with various university interest groups, such as faculty and students. Typically, some of these meetings are also public. 
Next, the Board of Supervisors will hold a special meeting to vote on hiring a president. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard did not immediately share when that meeting will be.

Mike Kehoe denied clemency Monday to Lance Shockley, a man sentenced to be executed at 6 p.m. Tuesday, citing Shockley’s unanimous conviction by jury for the 2005 murder of Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl DeWayne Graham Jr.
But according to Shockley’s attorneys, the execution may be delayed by a motion filed last week in the U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the Missouri Department of Corrections’ refusal to allow his daughter, who is an ordained minister, to accompany him as his spiritual advisor in the execution chamber.
While Kehoe in a press release Monday described his denial of clemency as evidence of Missouri’s “commitment to the pursuit of justice,” Shockley’s advocates have argued he should not be executed because he was sentenced to death by a judge after the jury could not reach agreement on the death penalty. 
Missouri is one of only two states, along with Indiana, that allow judges to unilaterally choose the death penalty when a jury is split on how to sentence a defendant for a capital offense. In most other states, a deadlocked jury results in a life sentence. 
“[Kehoe] didn’t talk at all about the fact that the same jury that convicted him didn’t say he should die,” said Jeremy Weis, Shockley’s lead attorney and an assistant federal public defender. “I find that troubling and disappointing.”
Graham was found shot dead in the driveway of his home in Carter County in March 2005. He had been investigating Shockley’s role in a fatal 2004 drunk driving accident, which the prosecution said gave Shockley a motive for murder.
Kehoe noted in the press release that the Missouri Supreme Court, a federal district court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court all reviewed Shockley’s case and let the trial court’s decision stand.
“Mr. Shockley has received every legal protection afforded to him under the Missouri and United States Constitutions,” Kehoe said, “and his sentence will remain for his brutal and deliberate crime.” 
Weis said Thursday that Shockley’s legal team had found after the trial that at least two of the 12 jurors who convicted Shockley voted for him to serve life in prison.
The motion to delay Shockley’s execution centers on a policy of the Department of Corrections allowing defendants the presence of a chosen spiritual advisor as they are put to death. The department denied Shockley’s request that his daughter fill this role, citing a policy prohibiting contact visits with family members once an execution has been scheduled.
“They just don’t want to follow their policy,” Weis said.
Weis said he expects a ruling Monday on the motion to delay Shockley’s execution.

U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) called a new policy enacted by President Donald Trump “unprecedented” and “straight out of an authoritarian playbook, where the President gets to play judge, jury and executioner” in a speech on the Senate floor on Oct. 8. 
The policy, known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, was published by the White House on Sept. 25 and gives the president and the Attorney General broad authority to investigate any person or group that they consider to be involved in domestic terrorism or political violence. 
“As a nation, I think we should have as a basic principle that you can’t have a secret list of terrorist organizations that the American public and certainly the U.S. Congress don’t get to even know the names of,” Slotkin said. 
The memorandum says that any group advocating for a wide range of political views, which the statement lumps as “anti-fascist,” could fall into this category and thus be deemed terrorist organizations. Specifically, he includes any groups that demonstrate “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” 
Slotkin’s comments came during debate on a war powers resolution from Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California that sought to limit the president’s power to authorize military action, following four strikes on boats in the Caribbean. The resolution failed 48-51. 
According to Slotkin, a letter from the Trump administration said that the United States is in “a non-international armed conflict” against “designated terrorist organizations,” she said in her speech. After asking for a list of those organizations from the Department of Defense, Slotkin added, she was told that no such list could be provided. 
“If this administration is not telling us who’s on their secret designated terrorist list for groups in the Caribbean, they’re definitely not going to tell us who’s on their list of domestic terrorist organizations,” she continued. 
A request for comment was sent to the White House, but has yet to be returned.
Slotkin, a CIA officer and former Pentagon official, noted the differences between this practice and how in the past new terrorist groups would be designated — by notification to Congress. 
“But that is not what’s going on today,” she said. “We will not understand the apparently dozens of terrorist organizations that we have now named until we understand their names.”
As written in the White House memo, recommendations of which groups to designate as domestic terrorists can come from the Attorney General. “The Attorney General shall submit a list of any such groups or entities to the President through the Assistant to the President and Homeland Security Advisor,” it continues, leaving Congress out of that chain of communication entirely. 
Though there has been no confirmation if any group has been investigated or designated as domestic terrorist organizations, a Reuters article published the day after Slotkin’s speech explained broader implications of the policy, saying that individuals like Democratic donors George Soros and Reid Hoffman might be potential targets of investigation for Trump.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: The race for NJ governor]New Jerseyans looking to pick the state’s next governor have until Tuesday to register in time to vote in this year’s gubernatorial race.
State residents who are U.S. Citizens can register to vote if they are not incarcerated and have lived in their county for at least 30 days preceding Election Day. They must be at least 17 to register, though only those who turn 18 before Nov. 4 are eligible to vote.
Would-be voters can register online or by returning registration applications in person to their county’s superintendent of elections or commissioner of registration, depending on the county. Those offices, like local clerks and some state agencies, can provide voter registration forms.
Those forms can also be obtained online, and officials will accept voter registration applications returned by mail as long as they are postmarked no later than Oct. 14. New Jersey requires voters to be registered 21 days before an election to vote in that race.
Besides the governor’s race — Jack Ciattarelli (R) and Mikie Sherrill (D) are the front-runners to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D) — all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot this year.
The election is Nov. 4. Early in-person voting begins Saturday, Oct. 25. Mail-in ballots are being accepted now.
Repeat matchup in South Jersey Assembly race could be a nail-biter

Though Democrats maintain a massive voter registration lead, that lead has narrowed since the state’s last gubernatorial contest.
In 2021, there were a little less than 2.6 million registered Democrats and just over 1.5 million registered Republicans on Election Day.
By the start of this month, Democrats’ registration edge had narrowed to 855,049, according to state voter registration data. Republican gains and Democratic losses both drove the changes.
The GOP gained 163,847 registered voters since Election Day 2021, while Democrats lost 51,396.
The number of unaffiliated voters — what New Jersey calls independents — also declined over that time, falling by 70,369 to more than 2.3 million.
New Jersey has gained 33,991 voters since the last gubernatorial election. Just over 6.6 million residents are registered to cast ballots in the state.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A recent state law meant to provide some abuse victims sentencing relief in criminal cases may need tweaking, two of the measure’s authors said.
Former House Majority Leader Jon Echols, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Del City, said a recent Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling highlights potential loopholes in the Oklahoma Survivors’ Act in its utilization by inmates and interpretation by judges.   
The law allows judges to give criminal defendants who are domestic violence victims lighter sentences if they can prove prior abuse contributed to the crime.
A 41-year-old offender appealed for relief under the law, alleging that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health issues from time spent in group homes and foster care as a child, according to court records. He alleged there was a connection between his PTSD and the crimes.
The man said his 20-year concurrent sentences were excessive, according to court records.
The man is serving time at Northeastern Oklahoma Community Corrections Center in Vinita for escaping from a penal institution and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.
A Grant County district judge found the man might qualify for relief under the law created by Senate Bill 1835, which took effect in August 2024. He ordered the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System to represent the offender in his quest for a sentence reduction.
Jamie Pybas, Oklahoma Indigent Defense System executive director, appealed the order, arguing that state law prohibits their attorneys from being appointed to represent individuals appealing non-death penalty cases.
The state’s high court agreed, finding that while the Oklahoma Survivors’ Act allows judges to appoint an attorney to represent those seeking relief under the act, it does not specifically require representation through the Oklahoma Indigent Defense System.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court also found that the district court judge lacked the authority to appoint the indigent defense system to represent the man. 
“If the Legislature desires OIDS to provide representation in such cases, the Legislature may amend the Indigent Defense Act to include the Survivors’ Act proceedings within OIDS’s scope of representation,” the order said.
Echols, one of the bill’s authors, said the man’s request for sentencing relief was an “absurd” abuse of the act. He said it was offensive to real survivors of domestic violence.

“There are real victims that need this,” Echols said.
Echols said there must be a nexus between the crime and the abuse, and the law was meant to apply in situations where an abuse victim was defending themselves or when a victim of human trafficking stole a vehicle to escape.
“Rarely do we pass something on the first attempt that covers all of the bases,” said Fugate, another of the measure’s authors.
Fugate said as lawmakers discover loopholes in their legislation, they often go back and fix them.
“It sounds like we may need to do some tweaking,” Fugate said.

Gov. Kevin Stitt vetoed the original bill, Senate Bill 1470. The Senate overrode the veto.
But lawmakers ultimately decided to send Stitt a revised bill, which he signed.
Prosecutors said they were concerned about loopholes and potential for abuse by criminal defendants.
Although sold as a shield to protect victims, Stitt wrote in his veto message that the bill would create a sword by which criminal defendants will fight the imposition of justice.
Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said he is in favor of the new law as it was written, but has concerns it could be subject to abuse.
“This guy’s ability to get this far in the process is pretty shocking,” he said of the 41-year-old inmate.
A recent Tulsa County case in which sentencing relief was denied cost his office $11,000 for an expert witness, Kunzweiler said. He said the law created an unfunded mandate for his office.
He said the law could be cleaned up to make it more clear.
Kyle Cabelka, district attorney for Comanche and Cotton counties and chair of the Oklahoma District Attorneys Council, said although lawmakers made positive changes to the law, it is still overly broad.
“I think that the language could be changed in a way that would at least give everybody more guidance,” he said.

(Courtesy Montana FWP)Investigations into two separate poaching cases by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks have led to recent charges against four men, the department said in a series of press releases last week.
A special prosecutor filed charges against three Big Horn County men in Montana’s 22nd Judicial District Court alleging the unlawful killing of several bull elk and one mule deer near Hardin between 2022 and 2023.
Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials began investigating the case after receiving reports about a headless elk carcass in an area that no one had permission to hunt. Wardens with the department found that the group of individuals had allegedly killed and possessed several bull elk in Hunting District 702 during a closed season and without landowner permission. A mule deer buck was also killed without hunting licenses or landowner permission, according to the department’s press release.
Montana wardens executed multiple search warrants and seized several mounts of allegedly illegally killed deer and elk.
The three individuals are charged with 33 total charges, including 10 felony charges and 23 misdemeanor charges.

The investigation was in partnership with Montana Fish Wildlife & Parks, the U.S.  Fish & Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Fish, Wildlife and Parks also announced last week that a North Dakota man has also been charged in Fergus County District Court for a series of wildlife violations including allegedly killing two bull elk last November.
According to a press release, the man is accused of multiple misdemeanor and felony charges after Montana game wardens investigated reports he killed two bull elk in Hunting District 417 without proper permits. He allegedly hid and abandoned one elk carcass after being questions by wardens and was unable to retrieve another carcass after killing a bull elk on private land. He was also charged with driving off-road on state land.
The North Dakota man faces potential penalties including more than $60,000 in fines and restitution, jail time, and loss of privileges to hunt, fish and trap.
FWP officials say that most poaching cases are investigated following tips from the public.

On Saturday, Oct. 18, more than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. are set to hold “No Kings” rallies in support of civil rights, democracy and the rule of law.
During a Monday press conference, state representatives Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) and Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) joined with political organizers and members of advocacy groups to call out the Trump administration’s threats to immigration, free expression, political dissent and due process.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Trump [Vice President J.D.Vance] and [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller have been frank, the only legitimate Americans are those that agree with them and look like them, and the rest of us are terrorists, illegals, thugs,” said Shanay Watson-Whitaker, the director of Michigan campaigns at Reproductive Freedom For All. “It’s no accident that the only refugees currently allowed in the country are white South Africans. That’s what’s going on here, criminalizing the opposition, gutting our democracy and getting rid of people who get in the way.”
From the deployment of National Guard troops in several American cities, to the Trump Administration’s prosecution of the president’s political opponents, pressure and threats against celebrities and media outlets and the violent tactics deployed by U.S. Immigrations, Customs and Enforcement agents, speakers called out several instances of overreach since Trump took office in January. 
“Even if you have never feared deportation, even if you think this doesn’t touch your life, it will,” said Isa Azaria, an organizer and educator with We The People Dissent. “Authoritarianism always starts with those deemed ‘the other.’ Once those systems of surveillance, detention and militarization are normalized, they are turned on anyone who resists.” 
Christy McGillivray, executive director of the nonpartisan Voters Not Politicians, spoke out against the Trump administration’s effort to investigate groups opposed to his agenda, arguing the government is working to intimidate opponents and criminalize opposition. 
However, the best way to defend the right to free speech is by using it, McGillivray said. 
“This is what it means to be Americans. We are the ones living up to our Constitution’s ideals,” McGillivray said. “We are building a huge non-partisan tent. We welcome all free speech advocates and proud defenders of our Constitutionally protected civil rights to join us on the 18th and into the future. The Trump administration is lying to Americans about threats that are not real in order to hide the very real threat that they pose. We know better.”
Rheinegans closed the press conference with a call for citizens to let their voices be heard.
“The courts won’t save us. The media won’t save us. Corporate America won’t save us. That leaves us — the people. Through peaceful resistance and local organizing, we can restore our democracy. This is our moment to lead,” she said.
Communities where “No Kings” rallies will be held include Detroit, Lansing, Grand Rapids, Flint, Ann Arbor, Battle Creek, St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie.

Hamer’s family donated the medal to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, which operates the Museum of Mississippi History and Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.
 “Our hope is that others will see it and want to learn more about Aunt Fannie Lou, her life, her legacy and the tremendous sacrifices she made on behalf of others,” Hamer’s niece, Monica Land, said in a press release Monday.
Curators will decide where the medal is displayed, said Michael Morris, director of the two museums that are side-by-side in downtown Jackson.
“Our museums already trace much of her life’s work,” Morris said. “The medal symbolizes the impact her courageous activism has had on the lives of Black people in Mississippi and across the nation.”

Hamer was born Fannie Lou Townsend in 1917 to sharecroppers in Montgomery County, Mississippi. She joined the Civil Rights Movement in 1961 after attending a meeting with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She became a SNCC organizer in 1962.
Hamer went on to become a key figure in Mississippi’s Civil Rights Movement. 
In 1964, Hamer helped organize Freedom Summer and co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. The party traveled to the 1964 Democratic National Convention and tried to be recognized as an official delegation. She also addressed the Credentials Committee, speaking out about her experiences with racism and human rights abuses in Mississippi on national television.

The […]","A WEEK AGO, the CDC’s acting director signed off on the recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an external panel that sets US vaccine policy. The committee voted to recommend that COVID-19 vaccines, previously recommended as an annual shot for everyone over the age of 6 months, be taken only after discussion with a health care provider. They further emphasized the importance of a risk-based discussion of whether to get vaccinated for individuals under the age of 65.   
Six of 12 members also voted to require a prescription for vaccination, a motion that failed based on protocol, but which reflected the distrust of COVID-19 vaccines that committee members had been voicing throughout the day-long meeting.   
Professional societies and public health experts have, justifiably, reacted with disapproval both to the way the meeting unfolded and to the wording of the recommendations. The 2025-2026 CDC guidelines are, for the first time, at odds with those of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.   
An alliance of Western states and a collaborative of Northeastern states each released their own guidelines just before the ACIP meeting, intentionally preempting CDC, the inevitable confusion from disparate recommendations a small price to pay compared to the chaos that they anticipated might occur if pharmacies and insurance companies stopped administering and covering, respectively, COVID-19 vaccines for large swaths of the population who want them.   
The Department of Health and Human Services, under the current administration, has repeatedly claimed that its more measured approach to vaccine recommendations is intended to restore public trust– in vaccines and in public health in general. This may or may not work, but one thing is certain: They are losing the trust of the scientific community. In the latest two rounds of ACIP meetings, presentations were made by non-experts, discussions lacked scientific rigor, and decisions were not always evidence based.  
But there’s an ironic story here that’s not being told: CDC and the ACIP under the previous administration were already planning to scale back COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.   
In April, the previous roster of ACIP members, who had served under President Biden, convened a meeting that had been postponed from February. The COVID-19 ACIP work group presented a summary of its offline discussions. Made up of ACIP members, government health agency officials, CDC employees, and liaisons from relevant professional societies, the work group introduced the rationale behind a new proposal to narrow vaccine recommendations from the current “universal” approach (in which all individuals over the age of 6 months are recommended to receive vaccines annually) to targeting high-risk individuals only.   
Arguments for a change to a risk-based approach included the continued decrease in the risk of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths,  high rates of immunity, and the declining incidence of long COVID.   
They argued that the low rates of vaccination in the US indicate a lack of trust in recommendations around COVID-19 vaccination. And they presented a chart comparing US policy to that of other countries and the World Health Organization, highlighting the fact that the US is an outlier in its universal vaccination stance. In a survey of the group, 76 percent were in favor of a shift to risk-based vaccination recommendations.  
ACIP was to vote on this move away from universal vaccination in June. By then, though, all 17 members of the committee had been terminated. The COVID-19 vote was postponed to September, a decision which led to weeks of uncertainty due to the lag time between when the new formulation of the vaccine was approved by the FDA and the release of official guidelines for its use, all while Health and Human Services appeared to be issuing new vaccine policy via social media posts.  
Today, we have new vaccine recommendations from CDC, but they are accompanied by a growing rift between the agency and medical doctors, scientists, and public health authorities. Had the process been allowed to play out—with the original cadre of ACIP members voting in June—we might have guidelines today that are not so different from the new ones we just received, perhaps even more clearly outlining which populations are low risk.   
I agree that risk-based recommendations have the potential to increase public trust, but not without the backing of the scientific and public health community. Now, instead of trust, we have chaos.

,DC,2025-10-13 17:14:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Pentagon to shift research dollars to pay troops during shutdown,"Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-shift-research-dollars-pay-troops-during-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration plans to send paychecks to active duty troops this week, despite Congress not passing legislation to allow it during the ongoing shutdown.House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has refused to bring the House back into session to pass a stand-alone bill to provide pay for troops, welcomed the action during a Monday press conference, though he didn’t comment on whether the administration holds that legal authority.  “We are so very grateful that President Trump, again showing strong leadership, has stepped up to ensure that our troops are going to be paid on Oct. 15,” Johnson said. Congress approved a bill just before the 2013 government shutdown began, titled the Pay Our Military Act, that appropriated funding to ensure on-time paychecks for active duty and reserve troops during that funding lapse. A similar bill wasn’t necessary during the 2018-2019 shutdown since Congress had already approved the annual Defense Appropriations bill, one of the dozen full-year government spending bills that are supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Johnson and other Republicans have faced questions for weeks about whether the House would return to pass a similar bill, but he declined. The Louisiana Republican has said repeatedly that if Democrats wanted to ensure troops get paid during the funding lapse, they would pass the stopgap spending bill that remains stalled in the Senate. President Donald Trump announced this weekend on social media that in the absence of congressional action, his administration would provide paychecks for military members.“That is why I am using my authority, as Commander in Chief, to direct our Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th,” Trump wrote. “We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.”A Pentagon spokesperson said Monday the department “has identified approximately $8 billion of unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds (RDTE) from the prior fiscal year that will be used to issue mid-month paychecks to service members in the event the funding lapse continues past Oct. 15. “We will provide more information as it becomes available.“The White House did not immediately respond Monday to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Removes pressure pointTypically during a government shutdown, federal workers are categorized as exempt, meaning they keep working, or are furloughed. All are supposed to receive back fpay under a 2019 law that Trump signed, though he is now looking for ways to reinterpret it.Active duty military members are considered essential to federal operations and keep working during a shutdown, but a missed paycheck for troops has been viewed in the past as a pressure point on lawmakers to negotiate a deal.Trump’s actions have removed that incentive for Republicans and Democrats to broker some sort of agreement sooner rather than later. Johnson maintained during his press conference that Republican leaders will not negotiate with Democrats on their health care concerns until after the shutdown ends. Democratic leaders have said for months that lawmakers must reach an agreement to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year.Democrats have blocked the House-passed stopgap spending bill, which would fund the federal government through Nov. 21, from advancing until there is a bipartisan agreement on the subsidies. Johnson said Democrats chose to sunset those tax credits at the end of this year because they were tied to helping people afford health insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic.Since then, he said, the enhanced tax credits have become “a boondoggle” that caused the cost of health insurance to rise faster than he believes it would have otherwise. “It’s a subsidy for insurance companies. When you subsidize the health care system and you pay insurance companies more, the prices are increased. That’s been the problem,” Johnson said. “So if indeed the subsidy is going to be continued, it needs real reform.” Health care overhaul?Johnson said lawmakers need October and part of November to determine how best to address the expiring tax credits, though he also appeared interested in overhauling other elements of the Affordable Care Act.“Can we completely repeal and replace Obamacare? Many of us are skeptical about that now because the roots are so deep. It was really sinister, in my view, the way it was created,” Johnson said. “I believe Obamacare was created to implode upon itself, to collapse upon itself.”Johnson, who was a freshman lawmaker in 2017 when Republicans tried to repeal and replace the ACA, said he still has post-traumatic stress disorder from the effort falling apart in the Senate amid opposition from the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican. “It was a great frustration of mine and it always has been of President Trump’s, and we know that American health care needs dramatic reform,” he said. “Let’s just state it simply: Obamacare failed the American people.” Johnson said any efforts to overhaul the 15-year-old law would take considerable time, but he didn’t preview any of that during his press conference. “You can’t just rip it out at the roots and start over,” Johnson said. “It’s a very, very complicated series of measures and steps you have to take to fix it.”",,,,2025-10-13 13:57:26.196884

Gavin Newsom approved mandatory monitoring and reminders when kids use chatbots. But a bill supported by child advocates was left unsigned.,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom approved mandatory monitoring and reminders when kids use chatbots. But a bill supported by child advocates was left unsigned.


Gov. Newsom today announced that he has signed Senate Bill 243, legislation that adds guardrails to AI-powered chatbots that operate in the state.
The legislation had divided tech industry representatives and child safety advocates. Newsom left unsigned another bill regulating such bots, Assembly Bill 1064, which child advocates argued better protected kids. 
Under SB 243, companies that offer chatbots, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, would be required to institute specific safeguards. Among those would be requirements to monitor chats for signs of suicidal ideation, and to take steps to prevent users from harming themselves, such as by referring them to outside mental health assistance.
Makers of the chatbots would also be required to remind users that responses are artificially generated, and to create “reasonable measures” to prevent children from seeing sexually explicit content when using the bots. Kids using the bots would also get reminders to take breaks. 
The legislation, among the first in the nation regulating chatbots, comes after a series of disturbing reports. Stories around the country have highlighted how the chatbots can seemingly feed delusions, or fail to pick up on signs of suicidal ideation. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, faced backlash this year after a leaked copy of its chatbot rules revealed the company allowed its bots to have “sensual” conversations with children.
SB 243 received support from a changing mix of backers, with tech industry group the Computer and Communications Industry Association ending up supporting it. After initially opposing the legislation, the group said after changes that it would “provide a safer environment for children, while also not creating an overbroad ban on AI products.”
But child safety advocates, after initially supporting SB 243, soured on the legislation after those changes, saying they had conceded too much to the tech industry. Two groups, Tech Oversight and Common Sense Media, instead threw their support behind AB 1064, saying the bill “establishes critical regulations for the development and use of artificial intelligence systems that interact with children.”
Under AB 1064, chatbots would not be allowed without tech companies showing they are “not foreseeably capable” of harming a child, such as by encouraging self-harm.
“We’ve seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won’t stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability,” Newsom said in a statement announcing his signing of SB 243.
The statement did not mention any action on AB 1064. The governor has until the end of the day to veto or sign the bill, although it going unmentioned suggested his office was unlikely to move forward with that legislation.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/090222-Computer-School-MG-CM-34.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-13 13:57:26.196884

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas budget director objects to claims by House Speaker Dan Hawkins the state government budget adopted by the 2025 Legislature spent less than the amount proposed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
Adam Proffitt, who also serves as Kelly’s secretary of the Kansas Department of Administration, challenged the narrative repeatedly shared by Hawkins that the Legislature succeeded in trimming expenditures to a level $30 million below the governor’s budget recommendation.
Hawkins, who is campaigning to be elected state insurance commissioner, mocked Kelly’s decision to host eight public forums devoted to budget issues by asserting the GOP-led Legislature’s version of the budget was leaner and more businesslike. In a statement, Hawkins said the budget for the current fiscal year was evidence of thriftiness among Republicans in the House and Senate and wastefulness by the Kelly administration.
“The Legislature took the bull by the horns, implementing a new budget process that cut spending,” Hawkins said. “A reduction of over $30 million from the governor’s own proposal.”
Proffitt said Hawkins’ interpretation of the bottom line was inaccurate and incomplete. He said the final budget approved in April documented expenditures that were $23 million below what Kelly sought in January — not $30 million. In addition, Proffitt said Hawkins failed to take into account commitments by the Legislature that didn’t have funding attached, which artificially lowered projected expenditures through the fiscal year.
The budget director said the House speaker didn’t acknowledge the $13 million annual cost of complying with the Legislature’s pledge to expand services to disabled Kansans.
In addition, Hawkins didn’t reckon with interest payments of $16 million to $18 million annually on $215 million in bond debt the Legislature authorized in the 2025 session.
Proffitt said the state budget crafted by Republicans in the Legislature wasn’t more economical than what the governor outlined at start of the session.
“It now becomes pretty clear that its actually more expensive, not just in a first year, but when we have debt service for another 20 years, it’s more expensive in the out years as well,” Proffitt said.

‘Gimmicks, tricks’
Kelly, in Salina last week for the first of eight town halls on the state government budget, said her two terms as governor had been devoted to reversing budget mistakes made by Gov. Sam Brownback and the Kansas Legislature in the years before she took office in 2019.
She said that she forwarded to the 2025 Legislature a budget that was balanced, targeted spending on priorities of education and health, effectively used one-time expenditures rather than add debt for capital projects and would be sustainable in the future because it wouldn’t dramatically erode the state’s cash reserve.
“Unfortunately, this past session, the Legislature passed a budget that threatens the progress to prosperity that we’ve made,” Kelly said. “I know the budget that was put together last year by the Legislature is not sustainable over time. We’re back on the road to gimmicks and tricks, funny math.”
She said the Legislature’s approach to the budget would spend $300 million to $700 million more annually than the state collected in revenue. She said that at the current pace the state’s $3 billion surplus would be eaten away in three fiscal years.
“That is a huge concern to me, even though I won’t be governor then,” said Kelly, who leaves office in January 2027.
 
‘Gaslighting’
Hawkins said the governor didn’t have a grasp on the state’s revenue stream and anticipated expenditures. In September, the House speaker made that point after reports showed state tax revenue exceeded estimates by $47 million in the first two months of the fiscal year starting July 1.
He said the governor’s statements claiming Republicans had set the stage for crashing the budget were flawed.
“Another month, another gaslighting press release from the governor,” Hawkins said. “While the governor tries to point the finger at the Legislature, the reality is this: Real spending reform didn’t happen until lawmakers took the lead on the budget this year.”
He was referring to a decision by House and Senate leadership to appoint a special legislative committee that met in fall 2024 to craft an alternative budget to what Kelly proposed in January of this year. The Legislature, with Republican supermajorities in both chambers, generally ignored the governor’s recommendations.
Proffitt, the state budget director, said it was a mistake for the Legislature to reject the Kansas tradition in which governors set the starting point for budget debate during the annual session.
“I would say it was a highly inefficient process this past year and not one that I would recommend repeating,” he said. “It’s important for any governor to have input on the budget process and the way that it worked last year, and the way it’s being proposed to work next year, that’s not going to happen.”
Hawkins promised that work of the 2026 Legislature would resemble the results achieved in the 2025 session.
“When the Legislature returns in January, we’ll continue to hold the line, take a hard look at government spending and make sure your tax dollars are used effectively,” he said.
Hawkins encouraged Kelly, in her final full year as governor, to join Republicans in the effort to control state expenditures.
“I won’t be holding my breath,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Proffitt-Kelly-1-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-13 13:57:26.196884

Forever War, Part 1: This story is published in partnership with The Assembly and with WHQR, a nonprofit radio station and NPR affiliate in Wilmington. It is the first in a series of stories about the PFAS crisis in North Carolina. 
OAK ISLAND, N.C.—Emily Donovan stood before 100 people in the pews at Ocean View United Methodist Church in a small seaside town in Brunswick County, North Carolina. It was May, the start of beach season. She had invited a scientist to speak about the astronomical levels of PFAS—nicknamed “forever chemicals”—that had been detected in sea foam four miles away.
But before she began her presentation, Donovan, a co-founder of Clean Cape Fear, had to deliver some bad news. That morning, Lee Zeldin, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator appointed by President Donald Trump, had announced his intention to rescind drinking water regulations for several types of PFAS compounds.

The rollbacks included GenX, one of dozens that have contaminated the region’s drinking water and have been linked to disorders of the liver, kidneys and the immune system, as well as low birth weight and cancer.
Donovan felt devastated and enraged.
“Churches in Brunswick County baptize their babies in PFAS-contaminated tap water,” Donovan told the crowd. “We fought so hard. And now our hard work is getting rolled back.”
In 2013, scientists first discovered several types of PFAS in the Lower Cape Fear River, the drinking water source for several utilities in the region. The insidious chemicals were eluding traditional water treatment systems and flowing through the taps of hundreds of thousands of people.
The scientists traced many of the compounds to Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, 80 miles upstream. State and federal documents show that for 40 years Chemours and its predecessor, DuPont had been quietly tainting the drinking water of a half-million North Carolinians with high levels of toxic PFAS.
It took several years for that information to reach the public, but once it did, Donovan and her fellow environmental activists, as well as public interest lawyers, state legislators and local residents, started urging the EPA and the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality  to regulate the compounds.


Many went to Congress and to court. Clean Cape Fear pleaded its case to  the United Nations special rapporteurs on human rights, who concluded last year that PFAS contamination coming from the Chemours facility constituted “a business-related human rights abuse.”


Meanwhile, the scope of the contamination expanded throughout the state. Scientists found the compounds in fresh vegetables and fish, eggs and beer. Pine needles, honey and house dust. Landfills, compost and sewage sludge.
Blood of horses. Blood of dogs. Their own blood.
Finally, the environmental advocates prevailed. In 2024, Michael Regan, North Carolina’s former top environmental regulator who’d become President Joe Biden’s EPA administrator, announced his agency would regulate five types of PFAS, including GenX, in drinking water.
The celebration was brief.
Now, here was Trump back in the White House, and Zeldin, with support from the chemical industry, was dismantling those hard-won protections.
And now, here were North Carolinians, prepared to battle anew for the health of their communities. To stop Chemours from dumping GenX in landfills. To force the company to pay for drinking water it had defiled. To halt the expansion of the Fayetteville Works plant.
“This is a motivator, not a deflator,” Donovan said, a few weeks after Zeldin’s announcement. “We’re going to continue to fight this, now, more than ever.”
2013-2016: A Movement Is Born
The Cape Fear River begins 200 miles upstream from Wilmington, at the confluence of the Haw and the Deep rivers.
On its journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the Cape Fear rambles through forests of loblolly pine and courses under plains of concrete. About halfway to the sea, where the river grazes Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant, the company was sending PFAS into the waterway.

Had it not been for Detlef Knappe and several scientists, including Mark Strynar and Andy Lindstrom of the EPA, Chemours could still be doing so.
Knappe is a distinguished professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering at NC State University in Raleigh. He grew up in southern Germany in the small town of Freudenstadt, which translates to “City of Joy.”
Now a lean, ruddy man in his 50s, Knappe has retained shards of his German accent, but its edges have been softened, like rocks weathered by water. He is quiet and modest, and never boasts that he was among the scientists whose findings launched an environmental movement.
In 2013, Knappe and the EPA scientists were curious about a new chemical that DuPont had been manufacturing at Fayetteville Works. It was a replacement for PFOA, another “forever chemical” used in stain-resistant carpet, waterproof apparel and nonstick cookware, which the company agreed to phase out by 2015 due to its health risks.
Coincidentally, the EPA scientists soon stumbled across a pamphlet from DuPont that named the mystery chemical: GenX.
Knappe had preserved water samples from the Cape Fear River for a different project. When the scientists analyzed the samples for GenX, they found average levels in Wilmington at 600 parts per trillion, with spikes reaching 4,500 ppt.
“We all felt that was really high,” Knappe said. “But how do you communicate that information? There’s this mystery chemical, GenX, and we weren’t aware of much information about its toxicity.”
The scientists were right: The levels were as much as 450 times what later became the drinking water standard. Their analysis found GenX was passing through the treatment system at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. Residents were drinking, bathing and playing in contaminated water.
As the scientists worked on a paper that contained their new findings, the EPA lowered the health advisory for PFOA and another forever chemical, PFOS, to 70 ppt. While the advisory didn’t apply to GenX, the scientists were concerned about the potential health effects of the new compound, given its high levels in the drinking water.
We have to publish that paper now, Knappe thought.
When the paper came out in November 2016, he shared the findings with state regulators and utilities, but without toxicity data, no one knew what to make of it.
Then a freelance reporter for the Star-News of Wilmington, Vaughn Hagerty, happened upon the scientific paper online. On June 6, 2017, he broke the story of the scientists’ findings about GenX in the city’s drinking water.
People protested in the streets. Residents mobilized on Facebook.
“What was surprising and gratifying was the impact that article made,” Knappe said. “And how, maybe for a moment, politics stopped.”
2017-2018: Clean Cape Fear 
Donovan is in her 40s, with chin-length, dark brown hair and glasses. At 5 foot 10, she is swan-like and often towers over a crowd. She worked in corporate marketing for a decade, then moved to Leland, in Brunswick County, from Charlotte with her husband in 2009. At the time, she was pregnant with twins, a boy and girl.
She became a stay-at-home mom and for seven years taught Bible study at Little Chapel on the Boardwalk in Wrightsville Beach. After noticing some children were praying for the health of their loved ones, Donovan said she heard God call her to become an environmental advocate.
In June, she and several concerned residents, including Cape Fear Riverkeeper Kemp Burdette, social activist and retired obstetrician Dr. Jessica Cannon, and former Wilmington Mayor Harper Peterson, gathered at Peterson’s wooden dining room table to discuss how to handle the crisis.
The demonstrations had been powerful, but diffuse. The activists decided they had to channel the public’s anxiety into a coherent movement. They called the group Clean Cape Fear.
In Raleigh, Michael Regan had been the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality for just six months. He was homegrown, having been raised in Goldsboro, about an hour southeast of the capital. He graduated from the historically Black N.C. A&T University in Greensboro before heading to Washington, D.C., for an advanced degree in public administration.
Water pollution and obscure contaminants weren’t Regan’s specialty. He had worked in air quality and clean energy programs at the EPA and later at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Now as head of DEQ, Regan was facing the type of daunting challenge that can define a leader’s legacy.
2017-2018: Stymied at the Legislature
Republican State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., is 75, a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses. A former state and federal prosecutor, he grew up in New Hanover County and drank  water from the Cape Fear River for most of his life.
Like most people, Davis knew nothing about PFAS. But as an advisory member of the Joint Environmental Review Commission, he hoped his colleagues would support funding for local governments to address pollutants, monitor the river’s quality and hold hearings on the PFAS contamination.
Yet after a contentious Environmental Review Commission meeting in 2017, the Senate declined to hold another hearing.
Undeterred, Davis approached Republican Tim Moore, then the House speaker, and asked to form a special committee. “I said, ‘Tim, I don’t give a damn whether the Senate is going to support it or not,’” Davis recalled. “‘This is too important.’”
Davis, the senior chairman of the resulting House Select Committee on North Carolina River Quality, presided over seven lengthy meetings with toxicologists, state regulators, scientists and other experts.
Still, several legislators fell in line with the industry’s talking points. State Rep. William Brisson, a former Democrat from Bladen County who had switched parties, downplayed the compounds’ toxicity. “It’s not like the mice fell over dead when they were injected with GenX,” he said at the committee hearing.
Those hearings prompted Davis to introduce the Water Safety Act. But only one of the bill’s provisions became law: A $450,000 allocation to the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority to test the finished drinking water and to install a temporary advanced treatment system was eventually folded into the state budget.
“We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”
— State Rep. Deb Butler

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Deb Butler, an attorney who represents New Hanover County, was having even less luck than Davis in advancing PFAS legislation. Some of her bills called for an outright ban on PFAS, including their use in firefighting foam and consumer packaging. Most of the measures died in committee; some never got a hearing.
“One of the things I’ve learned in the last eight years is that things that shouldn’t be politicized are, and the environment is one of them,” Butler said earlier this summer. “We all drink the water and we breathe the air, and some of us just don’t seem to care about cleaning it up.”


2018: A Prayer Circle and Cancer
Brian Long, then the plant manager at Fayetteville Works, paced the floor before more than 100 people at Faith Tabernacle Christian Center. He wore an orange Chemours pin on the lapel of his sport jacket.
It was a cloudy evening in June 2018. The company was hosting a public event in St. Pauls, a small town two hours from Wilmington, to assuage the community’s fears about GenX.
“There’s been a lot reported on this compound,” Long told the frustrated, angry crowd. “We have decades of evidence and studies that suggest this compound—at the levels we see in our environment—do not cause health risks.”
EPA and academic scientists soon found that even at low levels, GenX was associated with harm to the thyroid, liver and kidneys.
Rates of thyroid cancer declined in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, according to National Cancer Institute data from 2017 to 2021, the most recent figures available. However, those two counties still rank second and fifth, respectively, for thyroid cancer rates in North Carolina, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.
Kidney cancer rates rose in Brunswick and Pender counties during that time, according to federal data. Pender County leads North Carolina in rates of testicular cancer, also associated with GenX exposure.
Local residents had begun reporting their experiences with cancer and other health problems. Some risk factors, such as age and genetics, make it difficult to establish causation between their illnesses and exposure to PFAS. Yet thyroid, testicular, brain and other cancers have been linked to the compounds.
Several advocates’ families were touched by disorders they felt might have been linked to          PFAS exposure. Donovan’s husband, David, had been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that caused him to go blind until a surgeon removed it.
Dana Sargent, then with Cape Fear River Watch, was worried about her older brother, Grant Raymond, diagnosed nine months before with a malignant brain tumor. He had been exposed to high levels of PFAS while a U.S. Marine and throughout his career as a Chicago firefighter. Doctors had given him less than five years to live. He was only 45.
Sargent, now 51, is from the Chicago area and arrived in North Carolina by way of California and Washington, D.C. She is short and petite, with long, flowing brown hair. She specializes in research, but her other quality is bluntness.
She attended the meeting, which began with a prayer circle that included Chemours. “It was asinine and repulsive to hold a meeting in rural North Carolina, in a church—to help shut people up,” she said. “They knew what they were doing.”
One man in the second row told Long that because of contamination in his neighborhood, he couldn’t sell his house.
“I understand you’re frustrated,” Long said, three times.
The man became angry, and as law enforcement led him out of the church, he told Long, “You have defiled the house of God.”
2018-2019: Chemours Cuts a Deal 
Here’s Kemp Burdette, the Cape Fear Riverkeeper, on how to snag an alligator to test its blood for PFAS:
Get a treble hook, the kind used to catch a marlin. 
Cast the rod over the alligator, which should be lying in the water. Reel in the line until the hook reaches the alligator, then jerk it with all your strength.
Steer the tired alligator to the bank. 
Then, everyone jumps on the alligator (multiple humans, if possible).
Finally, tape the alligator’s mouth shut. Stick a 20-gauge needle at the base of its skull to draw 15 milliliters of blood.
Burdette helped NC State University and EPA scientists apprehend alligators in the Cape Fear River and several nearby lakes to test their blood for PFAS. Alligators spend their long lives in water often polluted with chemicals; they can serve as models for detecting human health problems caused by contamination.
The scientists sampled the blood of 75 alligators and found 14 different PFAS at concentrations similar to levels found in the blood of Wilmington residents. High levels of PFOS  would later be found in several species of freshwater fish, prompting the state health department to advise people to eat no more than seven servings a year. Pregnant women should eat none.
It had been more than a year since the contamination had become public, and Burdette was fed up with what he viewed as DEQ’s inertia and Chemours’ negligence. He pestered the attorneys at the Southern Environmental Law Center: We’ve got to do something.
Geoff Gisler, then a senior attorney at SELC, began to strategize, but it soon became apparent to him what needed to happen.
“We sued,” Burdette said.
SELC alleged DEQ was failing to uphold the North Carolina Constitution, a section of which obligates the agency to protect the environment and human health from the effects of pollution. The law center also filed suit against Chemours, alleging it had violated the federal Clean Water Act by discharging PFAS, including GenX, into the Cape Fear River.
By the fall of 2018, DEQ and Chemours were trying to make a deal.
“In some ways it was a very sterile process,” Burdette recalled. “But it was also very tense. I felt like we didn’t need to do a whole lot of negotiating because we were right. They had poisoned the drinking water supply, and the state had let them do it. I didn’t want to compromise, and I think we did as little of that as we possibly could.”
By February 2019, the parties had crafted a consent order. Among the many provisions in the 46-page document was a requirement for the company to sample private wells for a dozen types of PFAS and to provide clean water to households whose wells were contaminated above certain thresholds.
No longer could Chemours discharge wastewater into the river as part of its manufacturing processes. No longer could the company expel hundreds of tons of GenX from its smokestacks; it had to reduce the emissions by 99.9 percent.
DEQ, too, had specific duties to hold Chemours accountable, including levying a record $13 million civil penalty.
“I think it’s been a tremendous success,” Gisler said in a recent interview. “It was never the final word and would never fix all the problems, but it’s a big step in the right direction. It’s our view that the polluter has to pay, and that hasn’t been happening, because the state and the EPA had not been enforcing it.”
In retrospect, Sargent, the former head of Cape Fear River Watch, wishes the consent order had been tougher. But when the document was finalized, few, if anyone, could foresee the scientific advances in detection methods.
“We didn’t know then that there were 350 types of PFAS coming out of Chemours,” Sargent said. “There’s still people falling through the cracks.”
Some of those people lived in Brunswick County, where private drinking water wells and river water entering the Northwest treatment plant were contaminated. That plant served homes, businesses and schools, including the one Donovan’s young children attended.
“It sickens me to think I may have hurt my children by letting them drink that tap water,” Donovan testified before the U.S. House Oversight Subcommittee in 2019. She urged its members to pass a law banning the manufacture of the compounds. “I will forever wonder if one day that will cause them medical harm.”
At the hearing, she named her friends—Sarah, Tom, Kara—all young, all with rare or recurrent cancers.
“I am begging you to engage your humanity, to find the moral courage,” Donovan said. Her voice cracked. “To protect the most valuable economic resource—human life. Because it’s already too late for some of us.”
Some of Donovan’s friends have since died. “They left kids who are questioning their faith, wondering why God hates them so much that they gave their parents cancer and didn’t save them,” Donovan said. “The people who fought so hard to get answers of what caused their cancer died not knowing.”
Sargent’s brother, Grant, was among them. In December 2019, two years and three months after his diagnosis, his brain tumor killed him.
2021-2022: Quest for Accountability
One spring day, Donovan spotted odd-looking sea foam near the Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, a popular spot for saltwater fishing. She learned that the best time to find the foam is after a storm or on extremely windy days, when the water is agitated. She scanned live beach video feeds and local social media chats, where people posted photos of the foam blooms.
Her sightings, as it turned out, were not isolated to the coast. State officials had seen similar foam at 15 other spots, including in Falls Lake near Raleigh and a stream in the southern foothills of the Appalachian mountains.
Eventually Donovan collected samples from 13 sites in the Cape Fear River and along the coast, including near airports and military installations, which often use firefighting foam that contains the compounds. NC State scientists began an analysis, a process that took more than a year.
In Raleigh, Davis, the Republican representative from New Hanover County who had successfully negotiated for GenX funding, was still trying to pass legislation to hold Chemours accountable. He sponsored a new bill, “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” that would require that polluters who discharged PFAS into a public water system pay for treatment costs to remove the compounds.
“I’m going to fight for my constituency,” Davis said at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. “If the gentleman from Chemours really wants to show they care, why don’t they pay to make the water safe from the contamination they put in that river?”
The legislation was referred to the Agriculture and Environment Committee, but, like several PFAS-related bills before it, never received a hearing.
In the same legislative session, Butler, the New Hanover County attorney now in her second term as a representative, sponsored House Bill 444. It was more aggressive than Davis’ bill and extended liability to dischargers of the compounds, not only the manufacturers.
The bill had more than 20 co-sponsors, including a Republican, Frank Iler of Brunswick County. It never received a committee hearing.
2024: At the EPA, Regan Delivers
Michael Regan had overseen North Carolina’s PFAS crisis as DEQ secretary, but a hostile legislature and an indolent EPA under the first Trump administration hamstrung much of his effort to change policy. In 2021, Biden empowered him to take steps to protect the nation’s drinking water in his new role as EPA administrator.
Yet three years had passed since Regan had joined the EPA and environmental advocates had become impatient with what they viewed as the agency’s sluggish progress on regulating PFAS.

Then, on a warm morning in April, Regan returned to North Carolina, to Fayetteville, the Cape Fear River flowing behind him.
He had arrived to announce the first legally enforceable maximum concentration levels for PFOA and PFOS at 4 parts per trillion and for GenX, PFNA and PFHxS at 10 parts per trillion. Several of the compounds were also regulated as a mixture.
Although the standards applied to only five of the 15,000 types of PFAS, they were something.
“This is the most significant action on PFAS the EPA has ever taken,” Regan said. “The result is a comprehensive and life-changing rule, one that will improve the health and vitality of so many communities across our country.”
Donovan credited the progress to the EPA’s openness to meeting with environmental advocates.
“We had conversations and incredible access to the EPA. We were given the same level of stakeholder value as the industries, maybe even more,” Donovan said. “The Regan we saw at the EPA was much more muscular than at DEQ.”
Not everyone applauded the regulations. Some conservative members of North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission, which approves or disapproves rules proposed by DEQ, blanched at Regan’s announcement.
Michael Ellison, who was appointed to the commission by Senate President Pro Temp Phil Berger, has a history of downplaying concerns about the compounds. At a meeting that summer, Ellison asked, rhetorically, “For decades we’ve been making and discharging this stuff. How many people have died from PFAS poisoning?”
Sargent was sitting in the room. Her eyes watered. She thought of her brother and the cruelty of Ellison’s remark.
“He had no empathy,” she recalled. “He thought this was a joke.“
The American Water Works Association, a national trade group of public utilities, opposed the standards for financial reasons. The Biden administration had earmarked $1 billion to help utilities in small or disadvantaged communities cover the costs of advanced treatment to remove the compounds, yet that was a fraction of the estimated $30 billion needed for all of the nation’s affected water systems.
In North Carolina, more than 1,900 public water systems would be required to comply with the new rules by 2029. If the maximum contaminant levels had been in effect on the day of Regan’s announcement, the drinking water of at least 300 systems would exceed them.
Two months later, the trade group sued the EPA, arguing the agency hadn’t followed the legally required procedures when it made the rules.
Regan felt assured the standards could withstand a legal challenge. What he wasn’t accounting for was that in seven months Donald Trump would win a second term and that Regan’s successor would begin to brazenly repeal the standards.
May 2025: The Persistent Republican
It was after 7 p.m. on May 7, and the North Carolina House of Representatives had been debating bills for five hours. Davis, wearing a gray suit with a white pocket square and a red tie, rose from Seat No. 9 in the House chamber.
“We’ve had a long day and we’re all tired,” Davis said. “But I hope you’ll give serious consideration to what I have to say.”
Davis was a primary sponsor of a bill titled “PFAS Pollution and Polluter Liability,” modeled after his previous legislation. It was just two pages. Although it didn’t mention Chemours by name, the language was so specific, it could mean no one else.
If a PFAS manufacturer contaminated a public utility’s drinking water above federally permissible levels, it would have to pay for the installation, maintenance and operation of a treatment system to reduce concentrations in finished drinking water to comply with those limits.
“You can make all the PFAS you want,” Davis told his colleagues, “but you can’t release it into the environment.”
A last-minute amendment—key to garnering enough votes for the bill to pass—narrowed the list of eligible public water systems to those that incurred costs of more than $50 million. Those were the systems in New Hanover, Brunswick and Cumberland counties, which, without the bill, would pass the costs on to ratepayers.
“These costs should be the responsibility of the polluter,” Davis said. “It’s only fair.”
Unlike Davis’ previous PFAS legislation, this bill crossed party lines to include many Republicans. It had more than 40 co-sponsors, including some of the most progressive Democrats in the House.
The members began to vote. On the digital screens mounted in the House chamber, names of those voting yes lit up in green. After 26 seconds, nearly the entire screen was green. The bill passed 104-3.
Davis was ecstatic. It had taken five years for him to carry a Polluter Pays bill this far.
“I was tickled to death,” Davis said later. “That guy from Chemours,” seated in the gallery, “I could see he had a sick look.”
With the House in the win column, Davis now had to convince the Senate to support his legislation.
May 2025: Sea Foam and an Industry Unrestrained
A few hours before Donovan’s sea foam presentation at Ocean View United Methodist Church, Lee Zeldin, Trump’s EPA administrator, dropped the hammer. He would rescind Regan’s maximum concentration levels for GenX and three other PFAS compounds.
The EPA announcement was even more troubling in light of the results of the long-awaited study on the PFAS-laden sea foam.
Jeffrey Enders, a research assistant professor at NC State University, detected 42 types of PFAS, including some manufactured only by Chemours. One type that Chemours used as a replacement for a phased-out compound, PFO5DoA, was detected at 20,000 parts per trillion. In a different study, scientists had previously found PFO5DoA in 99 percent of the 344 Wilmington residents who provided blood samples.
Levels of PFOS, which has not been produced in the U.S. since 2002, were found in the foam as high as 8 million ppt—the highest concentration ever reported in published scientific journals.
After Enders’ presentation, people told their personal stories.
“I live in Brunswick County and have been exposed my entire life,” one woman said, including while she was pregnant. Her drinking water well had a total PFAS level of 300 ppt.
“Now my kids are having issues,” she said, as she began to cry. “This hits hard.”
June 2025: The Senate Takes Up the Bill
Three weeks later, Davis’ bill was up for discussion in the Senate Environment Committee.
A few Republican members had warmed to regulating Chemours. “We need to run this bill,” said state Sen. Tom McInnis, a Republican whose district includes Cumberland County, another heavily contaminated area. “The folks at Chemours are notorious for not doing what’s right.”
Rep. Ted Davis Jr. (Photo: N.C. General Assembly)
Some Democrats thought the bill didn’t go far enough, although they agreed to support it. “You’re trying to hold the most culpable company responsible,” said Sen. Julie Mayfield of Buncombe County. “I just want people to understand this might not solve the problem.”
“I wish we could get rid of it all, but that would be herculean,” Davis said. “This is a baby step, but it might put a little bit of fear in anyone who might make PFAS.”
The tension in the room tightened. A parade of industry lobbyists began speaking to the committee, including from Chemours.
Jeff Fritz of Chemours said state regulators knew in the early 2000s that DuPont, which later spun part of its business off as Chemours, was making PFAS, including GenX. That is true. However, state records show that while regulators knew about the manufacturing, the companies failed to disclose in their discharge permits that they were sending PFAS into the Cape Fear River.
Fritz also claimed that Chemours voluntarily decided to stop discharging all PFAS. But he omitted the fact that the company did so only under scrutiny by state regulators. And that Chemours failed to stop all discharges until a second state inspection discovered GenX was still entering the river from the plant.
The bill didn’t advance. It’s eligible to be heard again next year.
September 2025: Zeldin Targets GenX for Rollback
In September, EPA Administrator Zeldin made good on his promise. The agency filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to vacate Regan’s maximum contamination levels for GenX and the three other PFAS compounds, siding with the American Water Works Association, a trade group that had opposed them.
“This is a flat-out victory for Chemours,” Donovan said. “They’re playing their game, and the Trump EPA is 100 percent caving to industry pressure.”
The argument hinges on what Zeldin alleges is an administrative misstep: When the EPA enacted the rule under Regan, it allegedly did so out of sequence.
The Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to first publish a notice of intent to regulate a contaminant and seek public comment on whether it should, in fact, be regulated.
Only then can the agency propose a national primary drinking water standard and goal for the contaminant. That step requires another public comment period.
Zeldin alleges Regan’s EPA proposed and finalized a regulatory determination—as well as the regulation itself—“simultaneously and in tandem.” Without a second comment period, Zeldin argued, the agency “denied the public and the regulated community the opportunity to adequately comment on and participate in the rulemaking process.”
The EPA proposed the PFAS drinking water standards in March 2023 and provided a 60-day comment period. More than 120,000 comments were submitted, including by those now challenging the rule, according to the SELC, which also provided comments.
The agency then published a detailed 4,570-page response to those comments.
Zeldin’s EPA intends to issue a draft rule rescinding the regulations for public comment this fall; a final rule on the maximum contamination levels (MCLs) is expected next spring.
A Chemours spokesperson said the company supports the EPA’s decision. “Chemours wholly supports setting reasonable and scientifically justified MCLs,” the spokesperson said, “but getting the science right is absolutely critical, and the evidence clearly demonstrates that the previous determination for GenX is flawed.”
The EPA retained two independent scientific panels to review its findings. Over 135 pages, the 12 reviewers largely agreed with the conclusions, with minor suggestions; the agency incorporated many of them.
Chemours is cherry-picking the facts, trying to “confuse the narrative,” Donovan said.
The company cited six scientific studies conducted from 2018 to 2023 that concluded GenX’s toxic effects on rodent livers could not be extrapolated to humans because of a genetic difference in how a protein behaves between the two species.
However, four of those studies included a conflict of interest statement from the scientists, many of whom work for private consulting firms, indicating the research had been done on behalf of Chemours.
EPA scientists challenged those Chemours-backed findings. They cited examples of how the protein in question is relevant to both species; in humans, medicines are developed to target that very protein.
More than 40 concerned parties have either petitioned to intervene in the case or to file briefs in support of keeping the standards: Prominent scientists, like Linda Birnbaum, a toxicologist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; attorneys general from 17 states, including Jeff Jackson of North Carolina; and environmental groups, including Cape Fear River Watch and Clean Cape Fear.
It’s uncertain whether the rescission will survive a court challenge. Under the federal backsliding rule, the EPA can’t legally repeal the standards, said Jean Zhuang, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. The Safe Drinking Water Act stipulates that changes to the standards can only be more protective, not less.
“What Zeldin has announced is clearly in violation of the law, in addition to harming over 100 million Americans and their drinking water,” Zhuang said. “These industries, like Chemours, are fighting these drinking water standards because then the pressure is off them to control these chemicals.”
Regardless of what happens at the federal level, a DEQ spokesperson said the agency will continue to enforce the consent order. It is also gathering data from public water systems to help them meet the drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline of 2031.
Accounting for private wells and public drinking water systems, DEQ estimates 3.5 million North Carolinians are exposed to levels of PFAS above federal standards.
The same day that Zeldin filed the motion in federal court about the GenX standards, DEQ announced it was requiring Chemours to offer private well testing to an additional 14,000 residents in New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus and Pender counties.
This brings the total to more than 200,000 homes in 10 counties that are eligible for PFAS testing. Of those, state records show more than 22,000 have been sampled and nearly 7,500 have qualified for alternate water supplies as stipulated in the consent order.
Previous testing has found PFAS 400 feet deep, nearly to bedrock, and in wells as far as 28 miles from Fayetteville Works.
DEQ says it has not yet found the contamination’s edge.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/13/black-business-expo-hartford/,"The event aims to promote the growing Black business community, showing off the entrepreneurial spirit and the range of opportunities.","Thursday night’s cool weather did nothing to chill the enthusiasm of dozens of Black business owners and community members who came together for what’s become a semiannual event at Dunkin’ Park.
In a room filled with music, silver balloons and plenty of conversation, people traded multiple things — food, money, business tips and more — over the course of several hours as the local Black Business Expo came to life for the second time this year. 
Some 60 businesses took part in the “Black to the Future”-themed event, which aims to promote the region’s growing Black business community, showing off the entrepreneurial spirit of local businesses owners and the range of opportunities under development in Hartford. 
The event first started in 2023 as part of the Black History Month outreach programming for the foundation arm of the Hartford Yard Goats baseball team. But the expo quickly grew in popularity, leading to the addition of a second expo event each year. 
“When we first opened up the registration, we had about 80 to 85 vendors signed up,” said Aisha Petteway, the executive director of community partnerships for the Hartford Yard Goats Foundation, and a lead organizer of the expo. “From then on, we knew that this was an experience that our community needed.”
That the expo has grown so quickly, local business owners told the Connecticut Mirror, shows that it is meeting a growing need. The event has helped fill in the local business landscape, smoothing over gaps and hurdles that have historically made it harder for Black and Latino business owners to find stable footing in the area.
Research over the years has shown that these difficulties are compounded for business owners operating out of Hartford’s poorest neighborhoods: these businesses can have even more issues accessing capital and navigating the process of developing an idea and gaining exposure.
Community events like the expo, organizers say, provide these businesses with a chance to connect directly with consumers. But just as importantly, the event allows businesses to connect with each other, building a community and network that allows local Black business owners to support one another.
It’s a more community-oriented model of economic development, shifting away from a traditional focus on banks, loans and capital and onto community support, social networking and shared resources. And in close-knit communities like Hartford’s, it’s a model that local residents and business owners say is crucially needed.
“To us, it’s about more than commerce,” said Petteway. “It’s about connection, and also highlighting the services, the goods and the culture of Black-owned businesses.”
Hartford has struggled to support Black businesses in the past
Minority businesses owners have faced a challenging time in Hartford. A 2012 survey of business owners conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, for example, found that the number of minority-owned businesses in the nation increased from 2007 to 2012, growing to make up 29% of all businesses by the end of the survey period. Over that same period in Hartford, the number of local minority-owned businesses made up just 20% of local businesses.  
The limited growth of minority businesses in the city has prompted additional research. One study in particular, a 2022 redevelopment study of Hartford’s Arrowhead Gateway area, a 41-acre predominantly Black community running parallel to Albany Avenue and Main Street just to the north of downtown Hartford and the I-84 corridor, offers helpful insights. 
The report’s authors noted that the neighborhood is one of the poorest in the city and has faced “significant disinvestment” as the result of the area being redlined and largely left behind after the construction of the I-84 corridor. The area then faced further neglect and decline as residents moved out and blight moved in during the 1960s and 1970s. 
But the block has still retained a strong cultural identity and sense of community. According to a small business assessment released as an appendix to the report, the Arrowhead area has become a hub for business activity as a number of Black and Latino entrepreneurs began to launch new businesses during the pandemic.

In the wake of this growth, additional support from the city could be a major help. 
“Technical assistance and financial support should be provided to support existing businesses in the area and create opportunities to grow new small, local, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC)-owned businesses,” the report authors noted.
These “technical assistance and financial supports” could include programs like microgrants, targeted programs aimed at supporting the growing number of local food and beverage businesses in the area, and the creation of an “entrepreneurial ecosystem,” a community-driven collective where entrepreneurs can support one another and collaborate on initiatives.
The city of Hartford is working to create some of these recommended programs, launching new initiatives in recent years. In 2023, the city launched a microgrant program aimed at supporting the city’s smallest businesses, defined as having five employees or fewer, with $2,500 grant awards. In 2025, the city announced the second year of the microgrant program in partnership with the Urban League of Greater Hartford, increasing the grant amounts to a maximum of $5,000.
And the Arrowhead Gateway area has been slated for a significant amount of development in the coming years, including new housing and commercial projects, as well as the first grocery store serving Hartford’s North End.
Other efforts are being driven by the community, building off of work started organically in Hartford during the pandemic. The Sto Marketplace, for example, started in 2021 as a space where Black entrepreneurs could sell goods and trade ideas, becoming a prominent business collective in the area.
One of its founders, Jennifer Wilder, says that the initiative has grown in the years since to include training and workshops and is now a partner in the Black Business Expo events held at Dunkin’ Park, one of the largest attractions anchoring the Arrowhead area. 
“We wanted to be able to fill in a gap for some of the business owners that we worked with,” Wilder said. “And it kind of just grew into this amazing experience.”
Building a business ‘family’
As she stood at the entrance of the business expo on Thursday night, Wilder noted that the event has become a transformative presence in Hartford, showcasing not only the power and influence of the region’s Black entrepreneurs but also the diversity of the types of businesses founded in Black communities. 
Wilder, a business owner herself, was there to promote both the Sto Marketplace and her work at the Big Red Book Truck, a mobile bookstore highlighting children’s books written by or starring people of color.  
A few steps to her left stood Wilder’s son, Courtenay Jackson, a clothing brand owner who was there to promote his apparel line, Eatin’. 
“There are so many cool stories here,” Wilder said of the businesses gathered for the event. “We’re such a family, so tight-knit, all growing and evolving. And as we do these events together, everyone is elevating their craft.”
That sentiment was present throughout the expo as real estate agents, cheesecake makers, candle companies, financial literacy advisors, and local artists sat at booths, speaking with customers, exchanging hugs and passing out business cards. A few women danced as Luther Vandross’s “Never Too Much” played over the speakers. 
In the middle of the room, Brittany Stokes, owner of Sophisti_Hippie Nails, stood next to her table watching people mill about, waiting for prospective buyers to approach to look at her nail art and press-on nail business. A sign in front of her stand read “Leaves are Falling, Nails are Calling.”
Stokes, a Hartford native, said that the business expo has been a valuable space for her as she continues to build her business, which was started during the pandemic. 
“The atmosphere is great, a lot of people here are people I know from around Hartford,” she said. “It’s about building relationships.”

A little further into the room, in a back area sectioned off for food vendors, business owners Lance McDougald, Gabriel Boyd, and Mike Johnson were also waiting to make their next sales. The business expo, they said, had become a powerful way for them to get their businesses started and help build a customer base.  
“It helps to meet the other vendors, the other Black and brown business owners and networking,”  said Boyd, who runs The 881 Grab and Go, a Caribbean fusion eatery on Hartford’s New Britain Avenue, with his wife. “It feels good to just be in the building with one another.” 
That spirit of connection and unity, of hustle and fellowship, is what Petteway says the event is all about.
“We want to build with these business owners,” she said. “It’s really a community.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ExpoWilderandJackson-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 12:58:10.076803

“Under Ned Lamont and his radical legislature, electric rates and taxes have soared to the third highest in the country,” Fazio said in the video. “They undermine law enforcement and [have] driven out jobs and hope.”
WSHU noticed the post on Saturday night, but it’s not clear when it was originally reposted. It was up until Sunday morning, shortly after WSHU reached out to the governor’s office for comment.
A spokesperson for Lamont said the video was reposted by accident and had been removed. They also said staff had taken steps to secure the governor’s social media accounts.
Lamont hasn’t officially launched a bid for a third term yet. However, it’s widely anticipated that he will.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor) A Florida House Republican has again filed legislation that would reduce the minimum to buy a firearm in the state from 21 to 18 years of age.
The proposal (HB 133), sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, a Brevard County Republican, has passed in the Florida House during the past three legislative sessions, but failed to advance in the Florida Senate. The existing law exempts law enforcement officers, correctional officers, or service members younger than 21.
The Florida Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Scott raised the age for purchasing a firearm in 2018 as part of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public High School Safety Act, just weeks after the school shootings in Parkland that killed 17 people.
The effort to restore the legal age for purchasing a firearm to 18 has been supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis and gained momentum this spring when Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced that he would not defend the law after a federal appeals court again upheld its constitutionality after it was challenged in federal court by the NRA.
“If the NRA decides to seek further review at SCOTUS, I am directing my office not to defend this law,” Uthmeier said in March, not long after DeSantis appointed him to his office. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
The NRA has subsequently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its challenge to Florida’s law.
Meanwhile, another federal appeals court — the Fifth Circuit — ruled in January that the federal law banning federal firearms licensees from selling handguns to individuals aged 18 to 20 is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.
Rejected in Florida Senate
Again, the state Senate has consistently thwarted repeal — in 2023 and 2024 by then-President Kathleen Passidomo and earlier this year by sitting Senate President Ben Albritton.
Second Amendment groups have been critical of those efforts, and they are speaking out now with concerns about what Albritton might do when it comes to an implementing bill that would make the open carrying of firearms legal in Florida statute.
The state’s First District Court of Appeals ruled last month that the 1987 law banning open carry in Florida was unconstitutional, and Uthmeier declared five days later that, in light of that ruling, he was declaring that open carry is now the law of the state.
However, speaking during a press conference at the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office two weeks later, Uthmeier acknowledged that changing the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest situation and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
In Tallahassee this week, Albritton told reporters “there are some questions” about the new policy, and that he was seeking advice from Florida sheriffs, whose political organization, the Florida Sheriffs Association, historically had opposed open carry.
‘Questions’ about open carry
“There are some questions about the Capitol, specifically, about how well guns play in or would not play in, so the attorney general has given some guidance on this, so we’re contemplating all of that, and wanting to do what’s right for all Floridians. So, we’ll just continue to think it through. We’re again seeking input from various folks who have the expertise to help us understand and we’ll see how it goes,” he said.
Luis Valdes, Florida state director for Gun Owners of America (GOA), told the Phoenix that the right to open carry has come from the judicial system, “not the Republican supermajority in the Legislature.”
“GOA will fight tooth and nail to see this repeal passed,” Valdes said Friday. “But with the same leadership still in place, the battle against the RINOs in Tallahassee continues. We will continue with our simple message of NO COMPROMISE. We will fight to make sure all Floridians, 18 and up, can freely exercise their Second Amendment rights.”
The issue of open carry in Florida made headlines this week when Publix, the largest supermarket chain in the state, declared that the company would comply with state law.
“Treating customers with dignity and respect is a founding belief at Publix,” it said. “In any instance where a customer creates a threatening, erratic or dangerous shopping experience, whether they are openly carrying a firearm or not, we will engage local law enforcement to protect our customers and associates.”
The new law also came into play on Thursday night in Tampa, when a former candidate for Tampa city council allegedly brandished a gun after getting into an argument with another person following a candidate forum for an election taking place later this month. No charges were filed in that incident.

Gretchen Whitmer’s signature program designed to aid automakers’ transition to electric vehicles, which isn’t going so well.
Business lobbying groups that represent thousands of employers are exasperated.
The fiscal 2026 budget, heavily driven by the road repair and public safety priorities of Trumpian state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), ends funding for the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, or SOAR.
SOAR was created by Whitmer and the Legislature in 2021 as a panicked response to Ford Motor Co. blindsiding the state by announcing a record $11.4 billion investment in a battery plant and vehicle assembly plant in Tennessee and two battery plants in Kentucky.
Lawmakers dropped $500 million from the corporate income tax into the SOAR fund in each of the past three years. But the new budget allocates no new cash for the business attraction fund.
Hall, who in an interview earlier this year complained that Michigan CEOs have gone “woke,” said whatever might replace SOAR will “end the days of cash giveaways, once and for all.”
Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) speaks at a press conference at the State Capitol on Oct. 7. Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
The budget also cuts $40.7 billion from business attraction and community development money administered by the Michigan Economic Development Corp., just over 40% of the $100 million allocated in the fiscal 2025 budget that ended Sept. 30.
Lawmakers also nixed $10 million Whitmer requested to implement population growth recommendations from her 2023 Growing Michigan Together Council report.
“These incentives have made the state a more attractive place to do business,” MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber that promotes the state’s auto industry, said in a statement. “(W)ithout an attractive suite of incentives, or a closing fund, Michigan businesses are at a disadvantage compared to national competitors with more resources of this sort.”
The cuts run so deep that the MEDC put out a news release telling the world it’s still in business.
What’s happening here is a growing bipartisan discontent over the value of business attraction incentives to create a significant number of good-paying jobs at a time when Michigan’s workforce is shrinking and the state is becoming steadily poorer compared to most states.
Michigan has fallen to 40th in per capita income, its lowest ranking ever, and slightly lower than the adjoining states of Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin.
Minnesota’s per capita income of $74,943 in 2024 led the Great Lakes states last year, while Illinois was second at $74,197. Michigan trailed far behind at $63,221.
Business lobbying groups claim other changes and cuts in the new state budget will make it harder for them to develop talent and invest in innovations.
The budget cuts $22 million from the Going Pro Talent Fund, which gives job training grants to businesses.

And it decouples state and federal business taxes so that businesses won’t be able to take advantage of accelerated deduction schedules for capital expenditures under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on their state taxes.
Decoupling prevents state government from losing $2 billion over the next five years, money it plans to spend on roads. A coalition of business groups regards the decoupling as a massive tax hike that will make investing in Michigan more expensive than in other states.
The “budget lands as our employers face a disproportionate risk from tariffs, the trade war and increasing uncertainty around electrification policies . . . adding further financial strain to many of our hometown companies,” Detroit Regional CEO Sandy Baruah said in a statement.
But Michigan’s economic challenges go far beyond the loss of economic development dollars in the new budget. The state has been losing ground to competing states for decades, regardless of which political party has controlled Lansing.
It’s long past time for policymakers to chart a new course for the state’s economy.
They can start by finally recognizing that chasing factory jobs is not the path to prosperity. Policymakers (and many of the rest of us) have a hard time accepting that the economy has shifted to services where most middle-class jobs are in labs and offices, not plant floors.
It was quite a tell when Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley recently said some of the automakers’ younger hourly workers told him they needed three jobs to make ends meet. Even the “old-timers” told Farley that working in the company’s plants is no longer a viable career.
Despite President Donald Trump’s ballyhooed effort to restore manufacturing by hitting imported goods with stiff tariffs, the U.S. has lost 78,000 manufacturing jobs since August 2024. Michigan accounted for 9,000 of those lost jobs in that period.
Most states with high incomes and vibrant job markets have diverse economies and lots of college graduates. That should be top of mind for Whitmer and lawmakers as they rework Michigan’s economic development strategy.

If there’s a single factor that’s playing the largest role in spurring the dysfunction and divisiveness that plague modern American politics, gerrymandering – the intentional rigging of electoral districts for partisan purposes – is it. With the assistance of digital technology and recent judicial rulings that have given them complete carte blanche, state legislatures across the country are making a mockery of fair elections by drawing and redrawing electoral districts to assure partisan electoral outcomes even before the candidates are selected.
And sadly, one of the national poster children for this destructive trend is North Carolina, where in response to the demands of President Trump, Republican leaders have signaled a willingness to redraw the state’s already rigged U.S. House map to expand their 10-4 majority to 11-3. Recently, in order to learn more about the GOP scheme and a new poll that shows strong bipartisan opposition to it, Newsline caught up with one of our state’s leading defenders of democracy and fair elections, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina, Bob Phillips.

Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar endorsed Sen. Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor Sunday, giving the two-term state senator key support ahead of the Nov. 4 election.
“For many years, we have seen the concerns my neighbors and I are facing — about public safety, housing, affordability and so much more — be met with the same tired solutions or, frankly, none at all,” Omar said in a statement. “I have seen how dedicated (Fateh) is to our city and enacting the transformative change Minneapolis residents are demanding.”
If Omar brings the full weight of her political operation, including volunteers and fundraising, she could provide fuel to Fateh’s campaign just weeks away from Election Day.
DeWayne Davis, Mayor Jacob Frey and Jazz Hampton are the three other major candidates for mayor.
Omar’s endorsement of Fateh isn’t surprising, as the Minneapolis congresswoman and Frey have a longstanding political rivalry that’s often manifested through various proxies, and they’re also sharply divided by ideology and political alliances. Frey is supportive of the police department and the city’s business and real estate establishment.
In the run up to the last mayoral election in 2021, Omar endorsed two candidates for Minneapolis mayor and urged Minneapolis residents to not rank Frey at all on the ballot. Minneapolis uses ranked choice voting.
In the wake of the police murder of George Floyd, Omar also supported a ballot measure that would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new Department of Public Safety under the authority of the City Council. Frey opposed the charter amendment, which failed to pass.
The following year, Frey, who is the leader of the more moderate wing of city Democrats, endorsed Omar’s Democratic primary challenger Don Samuels for Congress, but Omar beat Samuels’ primary challenges in 2022 and 2024. Samuels’ campaigns were run by Frey advisor Joe Radinovich.
Fateh was first elected to the Minnesota Senate in 2020 as a democratic socialist looking to upend the establishment, upsetting a prominent DFL lawmaker in the primary. He supported a statewide $15 minimum wage and defunding the Minneapolis police after the murder of George Floyd.
In a statement, Fateh said Omar is a “fearless champion for working people and a strong voice for Minneapolis, and I’m proud to stand with her in the fight for a city that truly works for everyone.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P1152812-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-10-13 11:59:39.808228

Though vaping was originally posed as an alternative to smoking cigarettes for older generations who grew up smoking, younger generations have begun vaping without a prior history of smoking. A recent survey showed that 21% of Missouri college students vape (Alex Buchanan/Missourian).Originally presented as a less-harmful alternative to smoking cigarettes, electronic cigarettes and vapor products have transitioned from an aid for addiction to an addiction of their own.
Vaping products were rolled out to help support a generation that grew up smoking. Over the years, however, younger generations have begun vaping without ever smoking in the first place.
According to a survey done by Partners in Prevention, a coalition that addresses student health behaviors, e-cigarette and vapor product use in Missouri college students is the highest it has been in the last five years at 21%.
Nicotine use in general is also at a high with 28%.
Brittany Carpenter, tobacco prevention coordinator for Missouri Partners in Prevention, said that she has seen vaping specifically target and affect the younger generation.
“They are potentially so much more addicted than we have seen historically in comparison to other products,” Carpenter said.
One of the main reasons is access.
Access to smoke shops, access to product use and access to more nicotine per hit have all altered the product’s purpose.
 Access to shops

If one was to look on Google Maps for a vape shop, there would be 20 smoke and vapor shops listed in Columbia.
Of those listed, two of them are concentrated in the downtown area, within walking distance of the University of Missouri, Columbia College and Stephens College campuses. Others are all within 10-15 minutes away by car.
Carpenter said that this could potentially be considered “targeting an intended audience.”
“Some of it could in fact be coincidental,” Carpenter said, “but looking at the history of the industry … proves that is in fact oftentimes purposeful.”
The vapor product industry targets young adults in more ways than one. Their bright colors and enticing flavors have been cited by users as one of the main reasons they started vaping in the first place.
According to pulmonary and critical care physician Kate Grossman, this targeting is a very effective business strategy to build an extremely loyal customer base.
“We know from people who smoke combustible cigarettes that if you start in adolescence you’re more likely to smoke as an adult, and the same holds true with vaping,” Grossman said.
 Access to products in public

Carpenter also said that the allowance of vaping in nonsmoking areas gives users more of an opportunity to use the product.
“People are able to use these products in places that they are not able to use traditional products like cigarettes,” Carpenter said.
This current access is why part of Partners in Prevention’s mission is to address policy changes and update the language to include vaping products and e-cigarettes in restrictions.
 Access to more nicotine

Not only are users of vapor products allowed to use their product in more spaces, but they may be getting more bang for their buck.
As Carpenter explains it, a cigarette contains one milligram of nicotine, whereas the majority of vaping products are not FDA approved and it cannot be known how much nicotine is in a cartridge.
It is known that the average JUUL pod contains about 20 milligrams of nicotine, giving vape users more nicotine per hit than they would get from a cigarette.
“People just don’t think about the equivalent amount of nicotine they’re inhaling just by doing a JUUL pod, which could end up being one to two packs of cigarettes,” Grossman said.
 Pro-vaping organizations are ongoing

While both Grossman and Carpenter said that they would not recommend vaping in nearly any circumstance, there are still groups that advocate for vaping as it was originally intended: as an alternative for smoking.
The Vapor Technology Association is an organization that works to defend vaping products and keep their use legal through lobbying.
The organization’s main demand is that all legislation made around nicotine products is based on science and not on fear.
According to VTA’s website, its goal for the last 10 years has been “defending the American vapor industry and the rights of adult Americans to choose their preferred vaping alternatives to cigarettes.”
Carpenter and Grossman both said that if vaping was the only way to wean a nonsmoker off, they would use it. Instead, they try to pursue other FDA approved tactics such as medications, the nicotine patch and other tobacco replacement products.
”I don’t like to hang my hat on that at all,” Grossman said, “because we do have other alternatives for quitting smoking that have FDA approval and good studies behind them.”

Despite the fact that they have yet to adopt a budget for the state fiscal year that commenced July 1, and are scheduled to return to Raleigh a couple more times this year, it appears that state lawmakers have wrapped up most of their action for the 2025 legislative session. And if that is in fact the case, one of the biggest losers in the Raleigh policy battles this year will have been our natural environment.
In addition to passing new laws to weaken important environmental protections, lawmakers have failed to fund a host of important public initiatives that are designed to clean up dangerous pollutants and strengthen communities to better withstand future natural disasters. And recently we caught up with one of our state’s top environmental policy experts — the Southeast Director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, Drew Ball – to learn some of the sobering details.

As Alaska’s population of working-age adults shrinks, according to economists, other demographic groups have become bigger segments of the labor force: seniors and teenagers.
Residents who are 65 and older made up 6.2% of the Alaska worker population in 2023 after steadily increasing over two decades, according to an analysis by the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development. In 2003, that age group made up just 1.8% of all working Alaskans, according to the data.
For teenagers, the two-decade trend has been different. In 2003, teenagers 14 to 17 years old made up 4.4% of Alaska’s resident workers, but that percentage dropped in subsequent years – reflecting national trends — until it bottomed out at 2.7% during the COVID-19 pandemic year of 2020. Since then, the percentage of teens in Alaska’s workforce rebounded, and it hit 3.7% in 2023.
The information is detailed in a pair of articles in the current issue of Alaska Economic Trends, the department’s monthly magazine published by the department’s research section. 
The analysis of  senior workers was written by state labor economist Karinne Wiebold; labor economist Rob Kreiger reported on the labor trends among  teenagers.
A big difference between older and younger workers is the degree of the male-female pay gap, Wiebold’s analysis showed.
For workers 65 and older, the gap is wide. Men in that age group had average annual earnings of $54,835, compared to average earnings of$38,797 for women 65 and older. 
In dollar terms, older women in Alaska earned 71 cents for every $1 earned by men 65 and older. 
The gap widens with age, the analysis found. The gap existed even in the highest-paid job category, the analysis found. Top male executives who were at least 65 years old earned $112,799 a year on average in 2024, while top female executives in the same age group earned an average of $87,514.
Statewide, across all age groups, women earn 73 cents for every $1 earned by men, her article said.
Wiebold said numerous factors contribute to the wage gap and the way it widens with age. Those might include historic discrimination, but other factors are work experience, training, education, hours worked, job and industry choice and time out of the workforce for reasons like childcare and elder care, she said.
“All of these choices and conditions are amplified with age,” she said by email.
In contrast, the male-female pay gap among teens aged 14 to 17 was very small, Kreiger’s analysis showed. On average, girls in that age group earned 96 cents for every $1 earned by boys in 2023, the statistics showed.
For the most part, teenaged boys and girls worked in similar jobs. Accommodation and food-service jobs accounted for more than a third of employment, while retail jobs accounted for 18.4%.
By working mostly in similar industries and at similarly entry-level positions, the teens “haven’t had time for other factors to influence the wage gap,” Weibold said.
Demographic shift
Alaska’s loss since 2013 of residents of prime working ages, considered to be 18 to 64, has been well-documented.
There are multiple and interplaying causes, said Dan Robinson, research chief for the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Part of the reason is net outmigration – with more people moving away from Alaska than moving to the state. Another factor is the aging of Alaska’s population, he said.
There are also numerous responses to the loss of Alaskans of prime working age residents. One has been more employment of nonresident workers, he said.
Nonresident hire hit a new record in 2023, the department said earlier this year.
Increased workforce participation by teens and seniors is part of the multifaceted picture, he said.
“For teens, it’s because a higher percentage of them have been working since the pandemic, and for seniors there are simply more of them,” Robinson said by email. “It could be that seniors are postponing retirement as a result of the worker shortage, and for teens they are likely lured into the labor force by recent wage growth in low wage jobs,”
State officials and employers have also taken actions to entice more seniors and teens into the workforce.
Last month, the state marked an official “Employ Older Workers Week,” with a Sept. 21 gubernatorial proclamation noting that “older workers play an increasingly important role in maintaining Alaska’s economy and leadership in the global marketplace, adding depth in perspective, social networks, and talent.”
The proclamation mentioned the Department of Labor and Workforce Development’s Mature Alaskans Seeking Skills Training program, which trains people 55 and older who might have encountered barriers to employment in the past, such as disabilities.
As for the young Alaskans, the Legislature this spring passed a bill allowing workers as young as 18 to serve alcohol at restaurants. Key support for the bill came from the Alaska Cabaret, Hotel, Restaurant, and Retailers Association, which cited a labor shortage as one of the significant challenges facing its members.
However, that labor shortage might not continue.
“There are early signs that the labor shortage is easing and we’re returning to a more normal balance between job openings and job seekers, but we’re still gathering and thinking about that data,” Robinson said.

Scott Kawasaki violated ethics law by holding constituent events too close to the 2024 state primary, a panel of the Alaska Legislature concluded in a report published Friday.
The report was published by the Senate subcommittee of the Legislature’s Select Committee on Legislative Ethics, which recommended no penalty.
Under the Legislative Ethics Act, a legislator in a campaign cannot use state funds “to print or distribute a political mass mailing to individuals eligible to vote for the candidate” if the mailing takes place during a period that begins 60 days before the primary election and ends one day after the general election.
According to the report, Kawasaki e-mailed constituents a newsletter, distributed informational flyers and held a “Picnic in the Park” event to observe the opening of his office in Fairbanks.
Kawasaki, who defeated Republican Leslie Hajdukovich in the November general election, faced only Hajdukovich in the primary, making the race uncontested. In Alaska, the top four vote-getters advance from the primary election to the general election. Kawasaki and Hajdukovich were the only two registered candidates.
Kawasaki was first elected to the Alaska State House of Representatives in 2007, and to the Senate in 2019. He ran for re-election in 2024 to represent Senate District P.
Reached by phone on Friday, Kawasaki said that “it’s just sort of disappointing to have this be said and politicized, and then it becomes a potential issue in the future campaign.”
“It was a technical violation,” he said, “and I think it was unfairly weaponized against us just because of who we were running against.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250207-Kawasaki-copy-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ legal aid group relies on remote court appearances in 22 counties in the southwest part of the state after losing its only attorney in the region in August, said Kansas Legal Services’ executive director, Matthew Keenan.
However, some judges refuse to allow virtual hearings or appearances. Others treat them as a default.
In response to inconsistent practices across courtrooms, the Kansas Supreme Court proposed a rule change to give judges a framework for holding remote appearances with the goal of increasing efficiency and access to the criminal justice system. The proposal, which is not yet in effect, has drawn mixed feelings from attorneys and judges, according to interviews and public comments submitted to the Supreme Court and obtained by Kansas Reflector.
“Kansas stands at a crossroads,” Keenan wrote in a submission dated Aug. 1. “The promise of equal justice under law cannot be fulfilled if we continue to tolerate a fragmented and discretionary approach to remote access — especially when we have the tools and technology to do better.”
While Keenan said in an Aug. 1 submission that the Supreme Court’s proposed rule offers an opportunity to ensure full access to justice, some judges see it differently.
“What we do in the courtroom is important, and it is dumbed-down when people are allowed to appear on the computer,” said Chief Judge Clinton Peterson in the 26th Judicial District, which covers the southwestern corner of the state, in a public comment dated Aug. 29 that was submitted to the Supreme Court.
“Litigants are more disrespectful. Attorneys are less professional. Remote hearings make judges look foolish and stupid,” he said.
Keenan said in-person court proceedings are the ideal, “without question.”
He said a clear and enforceable rule change allowing for presumptive remote appearances will modernize courts and better meet “constitutional mandates, public expectations and the realities of access to justice in rural and underserved areas.” 
Keenan named a number of judges, emphasizing those in rural counties with few attorneys available to represent low-income defendants, who are averse to remote appearances. He said a shift to default remote proceedings is not radical, but rational.
Kansas is staring down an attorney shortage, which is expected to worsen if attorneys continue to move away from rural areas and aging attorneys aren’t replaced by younger ones. 
 
The balance of justice
The rule attempts to balance the discretion afforded to judges while prioritizing equal access to justice. As proposed, it says a district court should hold remote proceedings or allow remote appearances if appropriate “to increase efficiency and access to the court.”
Judges would still retain discretion to deny a party’s request for a remote appearance under the rule, particularly if the request is untimely or if remote proceedings “would undermine the integrity, fairness, or effectiveness of the proceeding, such as when highly sensitive, particularly dense, or exhibit-heavy testimony is expected,” the rule said.
A court should consider a remote proceeding under the proposed rule if all parties agree, the proceeding is preliminary or for scheduling purposes, the time and expense of travel for an in-person appearance outweighs the benefits, a remote proceeding would increase access to court or help address an attorney shortage, or if a party has health concerns about attending in-person proceedings.
A group of Wichita attorneys said the Supreme Court’s proposed rule “appears to lack deference to a vital component: the consent of criminal defendants.”
A defendant has a right to be present at every appearance during their prosecution, said attorneys Dan Monnat, Eli O’Brien and Braxton Eck of the firm Monnat & Spurrier in an Aug. 4 joint letter. They said the Supreme Court should add a requirement that a court should not hold a remote hearing or permit a remote appearance if a criminal defendant objects.
“As criminal defense attorneys, we contend that the defendant has a right to be present at every single proceeding or appearance in their prosecution because a simple scheduling conference can turn into a debate about case evidence,” the attorneys wrote. “An uncontested motions hearing can become a highly contested proceeding in which the fate of the defendant’s case is decided.”
Chief Judge Bruce Gatterman of the 24th Judicial District prefaced his July 30 written public comment with the acknowledgement that he frequently uses remote proceedings.
He said they are an “invaluable tool” for the only district judge in a rural, six-county district in west-central Kansas, especially for security, preliminary or procedural issues, emergencies or summary dockets. But he said he was concerned with the way judicial discretion is treated in the rule.
“I believe the proposed rule, as written, intrudes upon judicial discretion,” he said.
He proposed eliminating the list of reasons included within the rule to guide a court’s decision to allow or deny remote proceedings.
Other judges proposed tinkering with the rule’s language, favoring wording that doesn’t bind judges to hold virtual hearings. Van Hampton, a Dodge City-based attorney, wrote in a public comment dated July 10 that the Supreme Court should go a step further and make the rule mandatory. He, like Keenan, named judges who prohibit remote proceedings.
“This practice is abusive to attorneys who reside many miles away from the District and are required by the presiding judge to travel several hours to appear for a 5-minute scheduling or ‘status’ hearing,” Hampton wrote. “This is nothing less than an attempt to punish ‘out of town’ counsel for representing parties in the abusive judge’s District.”
 
Not a ‘cure-all’
The national average of attorney-to-resident ratio is around 4 attorneys for every 1,000 residents, according to the American Bar Association.
In Kansas, some judicial districts have fewer than one attorney. Two have none.
Nearly 80% of Kansas attorneys live in five counties containing about half of the state’s population. Those are Douglas, Johnson, Sedgwick, Shawnee and Wyandotte counties. And about one-third of attorneys in the state are over the age of 60, according data from the state Supreme Court.
While the Supreme Court’s proposed rule appears to be a “common sense” move, in Ann Sagan’s eyes, it’s not a cure-all.
Sagan is the new executive director of the Kansas State Board of Indigents’ Defense Services, the public defender agency that supplies attorneys for people who are charged with crimes and can’t afford one.
“Because of the rural attorney shortage, our agency has had to pay attorneys from urban areas to travel hundreds of miles across Kansas to represent defendants in rural areas,” she said in an email. “We will face even deeper attorney shortages as more and more lawyers in rural areas retire.”
The proposed rule seems to address the problems that have arisen out of the rural attorney shortage, Sagan said.
“However, it is essential that any application of this rule by the courts is done in a way that will protect the defendant’s constitutional rights and the public’s right to access the courts,” Sagan said.
It will not solve the rural attorney shortage, she said.
 
Rural rules
The Kansas Supreme Court created a Rural Justice Initiative Committee in 2022, charging it with examining the state’s attorney shortage, which one state Supreme Court judge said has approached a constitutional crisis.
The committee considered remote hearings as a way to address rural access woes, but it did not make a clear recommendation. The committee’s final report, which was released in 2024, said it extensively researched and studied digital tools to improve access to justice in rural Kansas. It articulated some of the same issues that have arisen in the wake of the Supreme Court’s proposed rule.
“Some members advocated for a rule mandating remote hearings in all rural Kansas courtrooms,” the report said. “Others argued that rural Kansas would be better served with more attorneys living and working in rural Kansas, and a mandatory rule detracts from that mission.”
The Kansas Supreme Court proposed the remote rule change in July, soliciting public comments until August. Lisa Taylor, the public information director for the Kansas Office of Judicial Administration, said the court received feedback from judge groups and bar association committees in addition to public comments. She said that after the public comment period for a proposed rule ends, the submissions are compiled and shared with the Supreme Court. 
“The court has discretion when it decides what to do next,” she said in an email. “Among the options are to adopt the rule as proposed or with amendments, to make additional amendments and reopen it for public comment, or to take no action at all.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/P8230030-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

The revenue is even stronger compared to the prior year’s first quarter — about $532 million, or a 10.7% increase.
“Our state’s monthly revenue report once again exceeds expectations — proof that the strong, pro-growth foundation built under President Trump continues to fuel our economy,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “We’ll keep building on that momentum to deliver results for Hoosiers through fiscal responsibility and conservative leadership.”
The fiscal year runs from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2026.
Revenue for Indiana’s general fund for September was $313.6 million higher than the same time last year — a 15.6% increase. And it was $131 million more than expected under the latest revenue forecast.
Sales tax revenue has been especially strong — up 6% in September and 9% above the prior year.
Individual income taxes over the first three months of the fiscal year have grown $205 million over the prior year, or nearly 12%.
The forecast was downgraded by more than $2 billion in early April — leading to major cuts in the state budget. Agencies generally have been forced to reduce their spending by 10%. That has led to slashing Indiana’s child care programs and laying off state workers, among other cuts.

On the far east side of Michigan, the future of fluoride in drinking water — long an ordinary practice for preventing tooth decay — has suddenly provoked passionate debate.
Public meetings in St. Clair County, about an hour northeast of Detroit, have filled with people weighing in. One man waved his Fixodent denture cream before the county commissioners, suggesting that his own experience showed what would happen if local communities stopped treatment.
“I am an unfluoridated child,” he declared, “with a set of uppers and lowers.”
Another man, speaking to the county’s Advisory Board of Health, said that personal responsibility should be factored into the conversation. “I think there are some 3 Musketeer bars, Snicker bars that should be accounted for. Some Coca-Colas.”
And a young man used his time in the public comments to address not just fluoridation, but the county medical director who’s trying to get rid of it. He accused him of grandstanding to land a job with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health and human services secretary, by making moves that “lowered the quality of life for underserved people.”
The raucous arguments were spurred by a three-page memo sent in June to the Advisory Health Board by Dr. Remington Nevin, the medical director of St. Clair County’s Health Department. It urges the department to take steps to “prohibit the addition of fluoride” to public water systems because, he wrote in bold print, the additive is “a plausible developmental neurotoxicant” — a claim that runs counter to the assessment of many leading experts and health agencies, which have long celebrated fluoridation as a public health triumph.
Nevin recommended fluoride restrictions that would apply to any system located in the county and serving county residents. Potentially, that could include the Great Lakes Water Authority, which provides water to nearly 40% of the state’s population.
Drinking water fluoridation, which was pioneered in Michigan in 1945, led to a massive drop in tooth decay. Even with the rise of fluoride in toothpaste and other products, it’s credited with a 25% decrease in cavities. But skeptics increasingly hold sway in government, as ProPublica recently reported. Those opponents include Kennedy, the nation’s top health official, who has called fluoride “industrial waste.”
Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency are reviewing their approaches to fluoride in drinking water, and Utah and Florida became the first states to ban fluoridation.
Local communities, though, are on the front lines of the fluoride wars in most states, typically deciding whether or not to continue fluoridating their drinking water by council vote or community referendum. The public conversation in St. Clair County offers a vivid example of how contentious the issue can become. Advocates from well beyond its borders are getting involved, saying that what happens in the county has implications for the entire state.
Home to about 160,000 residents at the base of Michigan’s Thumb, St. Clair County shares a watery border with Canada. Some 67% of its voters chose President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. (Kennedy got under 1% of the vote.) About 110,000 residents receive fluoridated drinking water, according to the state’s environmental agency, while an additional 6,510 are served by water supplies with naturally occurring fluoride.
In his memo this summer, Nevin, who is a physician epidemiologist, cited a state-of-the-science report from the National Toxicology Program last year that described an association between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. (The NTP is an interagency program within the Department of Health and Human Services that’s focused on toxicology research.)
Nevin also referenced a court decision in a case filed against the EPA by groups opposed to fluoridation, where a district judge relied, in part, on the NTP report in ruling that fluoride presented an “unreasonable risk.” Even as it appeals the decision, the EPA said its review of new science on fluoride in drinking water “is being done in coordination with Secretary Kennedy and HHS.”

The NTP report, though, is contested and based on limited studies involving fluoride levels that are more than twice the amount recommended by the federal government. Its own abstract says there isn’t enough information to link lower fluoride exposure with children’s IQ.
Nevin’s memo said that the EPA may take months or years to act on fluoride, but that didn’t mean local officials had to wait. “Across the Michigan Thumb, several townships have expressed a desire for similar measures,” he wrote, “and within St. Clair County, I have received a number of resident concerns related to this issue.” He recommended new regulations that would prohibit the addition of “any form of fluoride” to public water systems in the county that serve residents.
In Michigan, each community decides for itself if it will maintain fluoride in its drinking water system. But in an email to ProPublica, Nevin laid out a process where the St. Clair County Board of Commissioners could approve regulations that, in the name of public health, restrict the ability of suppliers to use the additive — in effect, enacting sweeping change throughout the region.
“Just as items manufactured in California are often subject to more stringent California environmental and health regulations, even if the majority are sold outside the state; so too could drinking water produced in St. Clair County be subject to more stringent county regulations, even if the majority is exported to other counties,” he wrote.
Whether or not this applies to any future fluoride regulations depends on the language that is adopted and approved, he added.
The state Department of Health and Human Services says it knows of no local health departments that have attempted such restrictions. In response to ProPublica’s queries, the Great Lakes Water Authority shared a May statement about fluoride, which says that the agency is required by its owner, the city of Detroit, to fluoridate its water supply. The current dosage is well below the maximum established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and the EPA, the statement said, and is in line with the recommended target for oral health benefits.
The water authority, which serves southeast Michigan, didn’t address the St. Clair County proposal. And it’s unclear whether the push for broad county regulations will gain traction.
As medical director, Nevin has an influential voice with county officials and shares guidance with Liz King, the county’s health officer-director. King, however, expressed reservations about Nevin’s proposal at a July meeting of the Advisory Health Board, according to the minutes.
In a statement to ProPublica, King said: “I do not support county-wide mandates to remove fluoride or actions that override the authority of local jurisdictions, unless there is an emergent or urgent public health need.”
Nevin was new to Michigan when he joined the Health Department in his part-time position about two years ago. He soon established that he would be an active force. He describes it in an email to ProPublica as “counter-activism,” adding: “I am largely working to counter the radical agendas of many past and current state public health officials.”
At the January meeting of the Advisory Health Board, Nevin provided members with a 2022 book by Kennedy — “A Letter to Liberals: Censorship and COVID: An Attack on Science and American Ideals” — that’s critical of the Democratic Party and government restrictions enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. (To the notion that he wants to work for Kennedy, Nevin told ProPublica that it’s “baseless conjecture” and that he’s happy in St. Clair County.)
Less than a year into his tenure as HHS secretary, Kennedy’s approach was challenged by six former surgeons general who served under both Republicans and Democrats. In a recent op-ed, they said that Kennedy is “endangering the health of the nation.” His agency criticized their track records in office when contacted by ProPublica about the op-ed, saying they failed to improve public health.
Nevin has moved to make vaccine exemptions easier to get, saying in an April memo that it would “improve the public’s trust in public health.” Those efforts helped earn him a tribute signed by 10 Republican state legislators, which also highlights his fluoride recommendations. Nevin also successfully pushed for the department to wind down services at school health clinics, arguing, in part, that providing direct primary care isn’t a core function of public health.
Supporters point to his training in the military and at Johns Hopkins University. In addition to a medical degree, his CV lists a master’s degree and doctorate in public health. On his website, Nevin also highlights his ability to serve as an expert witness and consultant in legal cases that involve adverse effects from certain antimalarial drugs.
Nevin told ProPublica that past experience taught him that it can take years for neurotoxic effects of certain substances to be recognized. “I have every confidence that, in due course, fluoride will also be looked upon as a neurotoxicant that has no place being ingested,” he wrote in an email.
He added that the response he’s received to his proposal from the community “has been overwhelmingly positive.”

But there’s been strong pushback. Dr. Randa Jundi-Samman, a recently retired dentist in St. Clair County, was one of the health professionals speaking in support of fluoridation at public meetings. She told ProPublica that dropping fluoridation would be a serious hit to community health.
“You’d 100% get more decay, especially in children in low-income communities that don’t get the chance to go to the dentist every six months,” Jundi-Samman said. “We certainly will see that. We already see it in people who don’t have fluoride in their water.”
Dr. Mert Aksu, president of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition’s board and dean of the University of Detroit Mercy’s dental school, said he’s hustling up to the public meetings in St. Clair County because it’s the duty of professionals “to make sure that the decisions that are being made within our communities are being made based upon scientific merit.”
Speaking broadly about the influence now wielded by fluoride skeptics, Aksu said, “We have opened ourselves up to opportunities from misinformed people who want to use this issue for political purposes.”
At an August meeting of the county commissioners, Kimberly Raleigh, interim executive director of the Michigan Oral Health Coalition, read a letter in support of fluoridation that was signed by the University of Michigan School of Dentistry, the Michigan Dental Association, the Indiana Dental Association, the Pennsylvania Coalition for Oral Health and dozens of others.

Nevin said in an email that the dental community “must recognize that community water fluoridation can no longer be relied upon to mask the dental problems created by our neglect of poor dietary choices.”
He argues that he has science on his side. “Scientific merit favors a recommendation to prohibit fluoride,” he wrote to ProPublica. “I have every confidence this will become much clearer in the coming months, as further federal guidance is inevitably released.”
Nevin’s recommendation is before the Advisory Health Board, which also was provided a fact sheet on fluoridation from the Health Department, submitted with Nevin’s approval. If the board endorses his proposal, King may then decide whether to propose regulations, which the Board of Commissioners would then weigh, according to the Health Department. Nevin estimated that the process could take six to 12 months.
Fluoride was on the agenda for the Advisory Health Board’s September meeting, which ended early because the members failed to reach a quorum. Nevin told ProPublica that he expects it to be discussed at this week’s meeting, and that he will present additional information then.
Meanwhile, Nevin has already influenced one of the county’s townships, Kimball, which receives treated water from Port Huron, the seat of St. Clair County.
At an August meeting, where Nevin spoke to the Board of Trustees, Kimball Township unanimously passed a resolution calling for Port Huron to discontinue fluoridation and direct any funds saved to support access to topical dental fluoride treatments.
Port Huron’s city manager declined to comment for this story, saying the township has not presented the city with any resolution or request. Nevin said in an email to ProPublica that he is “attempting to address every municipality in the county” with similar testimony.
After voting on the measure, one Kimball trustee made a point to show support for Nevin, saying “we’re blessed to have him making decisions.”
Nevin, he said, has had to overcome resistance from staff “pushing hard to make his life rather uncomfortable.”
“They’re not used to leadership,” the trustee said. “They’re not used to boldness. They’re not used to maybe some male energy that’s necessary to get things done.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-13-060619.png,,,2025-10-13 10:57:37.394618

Seven Missouri Head Start kitchens are set to receive nearly $2 million in grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the office’s efforts to promote healthy eating and nutritious foods.
The funding comes as part of a push from HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose office rolled out the “Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy” in early September. HHS said in a press release that $61 million in funding will assist more than 100,000 children and families across the country.
In Missouri, it will pay for kitchen upgrades, community gardens, bulk cooking lessons and more.
 How Head Start programs are taking on nutrition education 

July data from the Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security at the University of Missouri found that between 2021 and 2023, an average of 12.7% of Missouri homes experienced food insecurity, a 10% increase compared to the period between 2018 and 2020.
That equates to nearly 780,000 Missourians. Of those, about 356,000 are experiencing very low food security, where eating habits are interrupted.
For many children, a meal at Head Start schools will be the most nutritious they get all day, 2021 research from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows.
Lunches provided in Head Start centers provided more than the benchmark levels for vegetables, grains, bread, dairy and protein foods, while breakfasts exceeded benchmark levels for fruit, grains and dairy.
On days when children were in child care programs, meals and snacks contributed to 40% of calories a child consumed that day. And in Missouri, Head Start kitchens play a crucial role in addressing increasing food insecurity rates. In April, the federal government closed five of the 10 regional Head Start offices and fired staff, although legal challenges are underway.
For nutrition coordinators across the state’s Head Start programs, the funding presented a rare opportunity for essential upgrades. Many Head Start kitchens use commercial kitchen equipment, which can cost thousands of dollars to upgrade or replace.
“The majority of our money does go directly to providing the services for the children,” said Kayla Marmaud, the community relations director for the Community Action Partnership of Greater St. Joseph. “When you have funding that goes for the children in your care directly, some of the other things are put on the back burner.”
HHS required that half of the overall funding be used for materials, supplies and equipment for farm-to-table strategies, cooking demonstrations and appliance upgrades. Another quarter of the funding goes toward food service upgrades and sourcing local nutritious foods, while the remainder of the money will contribute to education, workshops and community events.
In Springfield, Head Start staff kept a running list of upgrades that were needed. When the funding was announced, they were able to check that list and pick top priorities.
“We selected the things that we felt like were the most pressing issues, or the ones that could give us the biggest bang for our buck, knowing that this is a one-time and not continuing project,” said Kimberly Shinn-Brown, the Head Start program director at Ozarks Area Community Action in Springfield.
They plan to make food service upgrades, as well as a slew of upgrades to their Head Start locations that have residential-style kitchens. Part of that means making the kitchens easier to use and work in for their staff, Shinn-Brown said.
Ozarks Area Community Action and others are also pursuing educational programs to help benefit their families. In Springfield, they requested money to bring on a new nutrition education program aimed at Gen Z families. The program sends out tidbits of information over text, so families can more easily incorporate nutrition education into their lives.
“They don’t want to talk to someone on the phone, and they don’t necessarily want to have a face-to-face meeting with you,” Shinn-Brown said. “But they do tend to be responsive if you text them.”
“It doesn’t matter how great your resources are if people won’t use them,” she said. “So we wanted to look at how our parents are accessing information, and what are their preferences?”
Daphne Graham, the health and nutrition coordinator at Ozark Action in West Plains, Missouri, knew the organization would have five new Early Head Start centers opening this fall, and requested funds to help with breastfeeding rooms for their families in those new centers.
They also are expanding meal options for parents of kids enrolled in Head Start to help showcase some of the cooking and exposure to different foods their kids get at school. The organization also plans to purchase more than 40 vacuum seal kits to give away to families across their 22 Head Start classrooms, with plans to help families learn more about batch cooking and preservation.
“Our demographic is very low-income … families that are sometimes just barely getting by as it is, and maybe education is not something they enjoy,” said Graham. “They don’t want to sit and listen to a lecture, but they would take in so much more in-person, so that’s where our education is going.”
In St. Joseph, they are applying those same principles to build community gardens at some of their Head Start schools and to create a new demonstration kitchen that will bring families closer to food.
“With the cost of food increasing, our resources sometimes tend to be more limited,” said Marmaud. “We wanted to be able to provide an opportunity that we could have community partners come in and be able to teach people how to get the most out of their resources.”
That sort of hands-on learning is shown to increase uptake of nutritious foods, said Lauren Landfried, a dietitian and associate professor in the St. Louis University Department of Nutrition and Dietetics.
“Getting kids exposure early is hugely impactful for their future health,” Landfried said. “If the kids are able to be a part of any of this, they’re more likely to consume the food. They’re more likely to have that positive relationship to expose others, too.”
 What is needed to create more nutritious meals for Head Start?  

Although the one-time funding was a welcome start to the winter months, critics argue that the funding does not go far enough in the face of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its sister program, SNAP-Ed, which provides nutrition education and other programs that address food insecurity.
“Any funding that goes to enhance nutrition education should be applauded and celebrated,” said Clarissa Hayes, the deputy director of child nutrition programs and policy at the Food Research and Action Center. “But at the end of the day, we know that this funding is not enough and it’s really putting a Band-Aid on the issue.”
Under new requirements for SNAP, most individuals will be required to show proof of 80 hours of work, caregiving, schooling or volunteering to receive benefits. In Missouri, that could equate to about 150,000 people losing food assistance benefits.
And under a new waiver request from Gov. Mike Kehoe, the food items SNAP pays for are set to change. The changes would bar SNAP recipients from buying soda and candy, similar to recent changes made in Kansas.
“The problem is not everybody knows how to cook,” Landfried said. “The assumption is that the people know what to do with the food that they are prescribed, which is not the case. In my experience, I had to do a lot of education on how to cook.”
Both Landfried and Hayes see the reliance on other assistance like food banks increasing while families try to stretch their spending on food.
Ultimately, these one-time dollars won’t do much to address the food insecurity issues rising across Missouri, Hayes said.
“It’s not enough,” she said. “It’s very hypocritical in light of all of the other cuts that this administration has made to the nutrition safety net.”

Immigrants’ rights groups and child advocates say the new law will help parents prepare for emergencies, such as a deportation. It caused a firestorm of controversy among conservative and religious activists who said it would allow adults to traffic kids.


Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children’s caregivers if their parents are deported, a measure that had provoked a firestorm of conservative criticism.
Assembly Bill 495 will also bar daycare providers from collecting immigration information about a child or their parents, and allow parents to nominate a temporary legal guardian for their child in family court. 
“We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies,” Newsom said in a press release.
It was one of several measures the Democratic-dominated Legislature pushed this year in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation crackdown in Los Angeles and across California. Newsom, a Democrat, signed several of those other bills — banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks in the state and requiring schools and hospitals to require warrants when officers show up — in a ceremony in L.A. last month. 
He left AB 495 undecided for weeks, prompting a flurry of advocacy by immigrants’ rights groups to secure Newsom’s signature in the face of intense pushback from conservative activists. The governor announced his decision the day before his deadline to sign or veto the over 800 bills lawmakers sent to his desk last month.
The most controversial aspect of the bill concerns an obscure, decades-old form called a caregiver’s authorization affidavit. Relatives of a child whose parents are temporarily unavailable, and with whom the child is living, can attest to being the child’s caregiver; the designation allows the adult to enroll the child in school, take them to the doctor and consent to medical and dental care.
The new law will broaden who is allowed to sign the caregiver affidavit, from more traditional definitions of relatives to any adult in the family who is “related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,” which includes people like great aunts or cousins. Parents can cancel the caregiver designation, which is intended to be a temporary arrangement and does not give that person custody.
Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them. Expanding who is eligible for the caregiver form, they said, gives immigrant parents more options because they may not have close relatives in the country but benefit from strong ties with extended family or informal community networks.
The legislation was backed by immigrants’ rights groups and children’s advocates such as the Alliance for Children’s Rights and First 5 California. 
“I introduced this bill so children do not have to wonder what will happen to them if their parents are not able to pick them up from school,” bill author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, said at a recent press conference. 
Critics claim strangers could get custody
But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights’ activists argued the bill would instead endanger children. 
They claimed it would allow strangers to sign the affidavit and claim the child into their care. Hundreds of opponents showed up at the Capitol by busload to rally against the legislation, organized by Pastor Jack Hibbs of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, who called it “the most dangerous bill we’ve seen” in Sacramento. Some of the blowback stemmed from false claims that the bill would allow strangers to get custody of children to whom they’re not related.
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, called the legislation “a human trafficker’s dream.”
In an email, Greg Burton, vice president of the California Family Council, took issue with the fact that parents might not be there when the affidavit form is signed. 
“What are parental rights?” he wrote. “These rights are nothing if someone else can claim them by simply signing a form.”
Over the summer Rodriguez narrowed the legislation to exclude “nonrelative extended family members” but it was not enough to quell the controversy. The legislation passed along party lines.
In comparison to a fairly progressive Legislature, the governor has often positioned himself as a moderating force on child custody and protection issues, which regularly galvanize conservative activists and put California Democrats on the defensive. In 2023 he vetoed a bill that would have required family court judges to consider a parent’s support of a child’s gender transition in custody disputes. 
At a press conference last week where activists urged Newsom to sign the bill, Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants’ Rights Los Angeles, asked the governor “to not listen to the lies, to not listen to all the other stuff that’s being said about this bill.”
Newsom, announcing his decision, quietly acknowledged the controversy in a press release. He included statements he said were “correcting the record” on mischaracterizations and said the new law does not change the fact that parental rights and legal guardianships must be decided by family court judges.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020825_Duran-Family_JAJ_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

A new study shows how it’s going,Cayla Mihalovich,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/10/proposition-36-treatment-study/,The biggest study yet on California’s tough-on-crime ballot measure Proposition 36 shows few people are finding their way into the treatment it promised.,"In summary
The biggest study yet on California’s tough-on-crime ballot measure Proposition 36 shows few people are finding their way into the treatment it promised.


It’s been nearly a year since Californians overwhelmingly approved Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime measure providing what backers called “mass treatment” for those facing certain drug charges. But few defendants have found a clear path to recovery under the law, according to new data released by the state. 
Prop. 36 gave prosecutors the ability to charge people convicted of various third-time drug offenses with a so-called treatment-mandated felony, which would give them a choice between behavioral health treatment or up to three years in jail or prison. If they accept, they would enter a guilty or no contest plea and begin treatment. Those who complete treatment have their charges dismissed.
In the first six months since the law took effect, roughly 9,000 people have been charged with a treatment-mandated felony, according to the first-of-its-kind report released this month by the state’s Judicial Council. Nearly 15% — or 1,290 people — elected treatment. 
So far, of the 771 people placed into treatment, 25 completed it. 
The data reflects how different counties are using the law, with the highest number of treatment-mandated felonies charged in Orange County at 2,395. Kings and Napa counties each had one such charge.
San Diego County accounted for roughly one-third — or 427 of 1,290 — cases in which defendants chose to pursue treatment, but did not report how many were placed into treatment or completed it. 
The report notes that this missing data contributes to “a substantial portion of the drop-off” in regards to the overall number of people who elected treatment but have not yet been placed. 
Francine Byrne, director of criminal justice services at the Judicial Council, said counties are still figuring out how to implement the law — and in many jurisdictions, it can take people a while to opt-in to treatment as they move through the court process.
“It’s not acceptable that so few people are actually going into treatment,” said Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association, which supported the measure. “The goal of this ballot measure was to take that population of people who have a substance use disorder and get them help, find them a pathway out of the criminal justice system and dismiss their cases. And that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening across the state.”
Raven said that district attorneys have been trying to implement Prop. 36 based on the will of the voters, but have been doing it “with one hand tied behind their back.” 
The measure did not include dedicated funding when voters passed it, which was one of the reasons why Gov. Gavin Newsom opposed the measure. Behavioral health experts have long sounded the alarm over the lack of behavioral health treatment and staffing across California, but proponents argued that Prop. 36 would be the great “forcing function” for the state to scale up treatment. 
Since the law passed, Republican and Democratic state lawmakers requested upwards of $600 million annually to implement it. Newsom and the Legislature ultimately approved a one-time state budget allocation of $100 million. 
On top of that, Newsom last month announced that the state had awarded $127 million in grant funding to build more behavioral health treatment capacity. Those funds were made available through Proposition 47, a 2014 voter-approved measure that reduced the penalties for certain non-violent drug and property crimes and stipulated that the resulting savings would be used for, among other things, substance use disorder and mental health treatment.
None of that funding was available during the time period associated with the report, which looked at case counts between Dec. 18 and April 30. 
Kate Chatfield, executive director of the California Public Defenders Association said the data proves that Prop. 36 “is a fail” — not because people are treatment resistant but because treatment is not available. 
“There’s no indication that anything will change,” she said. “Meanwhile, proponents are spending precious county resources on prosecution and incarceration in local jails and saying — magically — some money will appear for treatment. Proponents are the ones preventing those resources from being spent on treatment.”

(Photo by Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)A private equity watchdog group hopes a recent settlement reached between Nevada and an apartment rental pricing software company marks the start of reining in practices nationally that critics say allows landlords to fix prices on rents.
Nevada Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford announced the settlement with RealPage, a real estate software firm, last month. In the settlement, RealPage denied any wrongdoing or liability of any kind, but agreed to provisions that limits the company from using nonpublic data when calculating rent recommendations for its Nevada clients.
Nevada’s suit, which had accused the company of violating the state’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, is notable because it was the first state to settle directly with RealPage, said K Agbebiyi, the senior housing campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit that monitors the growing impacts of private equity ownership in the U.S. economy.
Though the settlement will provide “immediate relief” to some tenants, more needs to be done to rein in corporate landlords and bolster renter protections, according to the nonprofit. 
“I think this lawsuit is a good stopgap, but we need a huge overhaul for tenants to actually have rights in this country,” Agbebiyi said. 
Real estate software companies, including RealPage, have been sued by several state attorneys general and the federal government in recent years for allegedly artificially inflating rent prices. 
RealPage, and property management groups that have relied on software, have repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
Property management companies like Greystar, which manages properties in Nevada, have been at the center of federal and state lawsuits. Many of those companies have recently reached multimillion dollar settlements for allegations of using software made by RealPage to fix prices. 
Under the settlement, RealPage can only use nonpublic data to generate recommended rent rates for properties if the data is anonymized, at least three months old, and aggregated across at least 10 properties.
RealPage is also paying $200,000, which is going toward rent relief and down payment assistance programs. 
Similar lawsuits in other states are still pending. If successful, Agbebiyi thinks settlement amounts will be nominal, as in Nevada, but the cases will do a lot to chip away at the company’s ability to use its software to the detriment of renters.
Ford, who is running for governor, has called the settlement “a win for Nevada renters who would otherwise have been kept from the benefits of free market competition like lower rental prices and better leasing terms.” 
If other states get similar rulings, Agbebiyi said, “I don’t understand how it’s going to be financially feasible for RealPage to operate when the price sharing component of their software was the primary reason that people were using their software.”
Litigation could also prevent property management companies and landlords from using algorithms to artificially raise rents, but it won’t end price fixing outright without stronger tenant protections, Agbebiyi said.
Nevada is among five states PESP identified as “very risk prone” for an influx of private equity in various economic sectors, including housing and health care. 
“Where we see private equity make a lot of investments are in states where there’s not a lot of regulation that would prevent them from maximizing profit,” said Sam Garin, the senior communications coordinator for the nonprofit.
The nonprofit’s private equity risk assessment found Nevada is among the top 10 states for the percentage of single-family homes purchased by corporate investors over a five-year period. 
In order to rein in private equity, the group suggests legislation that states could take up, including: 

Adopting good cause eviction laws, which require landlords to identify a valid reason for an eviction or nonrenewal of a lease; 
Capping annual rent increases statewide at rates no higher than inflation;
Creating a landlord registry to identify beneficial ownership of all corporate landlords.

Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed legislation in 2023 that would have limited the number of units corporate investors could purchase each year.
The legislation was revived in 2025 and sought to limit investors from buying more than 100 units per year. But Lombardo killed it behind the scenes.
While Democratic lawmakers have backed rent stabilization for seniors for a one year period – also twice vetoed by Lombardo – some Democratic legislative leaders, including Speaker Steve Yeager, have opposed broader rent stabilization proposals.
The importance of being vigilant
A 2022 ProPublica investigation found rental pricing software by RealPage used algorithms, collected through lease transaction data and advertised rates, to effectively tell landlords the highest rent an apartment applicant is able to pay, and then charge it. 
The reporting has since led for a wave of federal and state actions to rein in the practice. Under the Biden administration, the  Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice both sued RealPage and property management companies that rely on its software.
“When Trump was elected, people were kind of worrying or wondering if the lawsuits would continue,” Agbebiyi said, adding that in the last 10 months there aren’t any “indications that RealPage can count on the Trump administration to help them out.”
The nonprofit has tracked at least 22 states in the last year that have “introduced over 44 pieces of anti RealPage legislation” seeking to rein in rental price fixing at the state and local level, Agbebiyi said.
Even if those efforts aren’t successful, “just the fact that it’s in the conversation, and also the fact that the efforts against RealPage are so bipartisan, I think that’s a really good sign,” they said. “It still shows that there’s still a huge movement against RealPage.”
Ford introduced Assembly Bill 44 in the 2025 legislation session attempting to regulate price fixing of essential goods and services, including shelter, food and medicine. It passed both chambers in a mostly party-line vote.
Democratic Assemblymembers Joe Dailia, Duy Nguyen, and Venise Karris joined Republicans to oppose the bill in the Assembly, where it passed 24-18. Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck joined Democrats in the Senate to support the bill, where it passed 14-7.
Lombardo vetoed the legislation, calling it “a striking case of government overreach” and “inherently broad and open to wide interpretation, likely making enforcement subjective and inconsistent.”
State-level efforts to combat rental price fixing aren’t fixed by a single lawsuit or piece of legislation, Agbebiyi warned.
“At the end of the day, all of these are fixes that can provide immediate relief to tenants,” they said. But without more aggressive regulation of industry practices, “landlords are going to find a way to circumvent the rules and to raise tenant prices.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ronda-housing-aerial-cropped-Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-2-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

The main difference between this technology and that of FORGE is that Rodatherm doesn’t stimulate the fracture of reservoirs to create energy, like other enhanced geothermal systems, but essentially, uses a closed-loop system with a heat pump at depth to achieve the same effect, Curtis Cook, founder and president of Rodatherm Energy Corporation said.
“It is a method by which we efficiently and at very low cost, convert heat to power,” Cook said.
The company uses a fully-isolated fluid directly in a power-generating turbine, a system that’s 50% more efficient than water-based geothermal generation, according to a news release from the company. It also promises to be competitive in cost at early stages of the project, and to have a multiple-decade life span.
“Utah in general, is very favorable for geothermal given its high thermal gradients. What that practically means, it has much higher temperatures at shallower depth, so it is much more conducive for geothermal power generation,” Cook said. 
And, the area is “very well-studied” attracting not only FORGE but other geothermal competitors, he said.

After initially losing funding for the project, Rodatherm has found opportunities with investors that highlighted their desire to partner with entrepreneurs looking for decarbonization solutions, according to the release. Current state and federal initiatives favoring geothermal investment have also played a role in the comeback. 
“A year ago, it was very different in how geothermal was being assessed, so the economics were unclear,” Cook said. “Fast forward, now under the (‘big, beautiful bill’), and the new administration’s support for geothermal, the economics of the project now look very robust.”
Michael Dabbs, vice president of corporate development at Rodatherm, said in a presentation to the Millard County Commission that the company is drilling down two miles, then two more miles horizontally in a loop crossing Millard and Beaver counties. 
“We’re looking to drill on Jan. 15. We’re fully permitted. We’ve already done some construction out there a couple years ago, but our financing didn’t quite go through,” Dabbs told commissioners. “So now we have financing, and we’re hoping to start construction this month.”
A federal environmental review didn’t find a significant impact, according to a 2023 news release from the Bureau of Land Management. The company is planning to generate about 3.6 megawatts in the BLM portion of the site for its pilot project.

(Courtesy HBO)In an act reminiscent of Mamie Till’s profound gesture of defiance, Steven Davis’ mother carried a photo of her beaten son’s face with her as she searched for answers about what happened to him, with an HBO film crew shadowing her.
Davis’ brother took the photo at a hospital where Davis, a man incarcerated in Alabama’s prison system, died in 2019 after corrections officers beat him. Sandy Ray, his mother, said she’ll never get that image of his face out of her mind.
“As many pictures as I have of him being happy, laughing and stuff – that picture overrides all the good,” Ray says in “The Alabama Solution,” a documentary six years in the making that premiered Friday on HBO and at the Capri Theatre in Montgomery.

Ray’s pursuit of information and justice is one of several plot lines in the film.
For much of the 113-minute run time, those incarcerated inside Alabama prisons tell their own stories, using contraband cell phones to capture shocking footage: rat-infested cells, overcrowded, dirty facilities with roof leaks and no air conditioning, and pools of blood in rooms where guards allegedly beat prisoners. They turn the cameras on themselves to reveal severe facial injuries.
Charlotte Kaufman, co-director of the film, said using sources inside prisons was a less abstract way to provide audiences with information they could get elsewhere.
“What the footage allows is for you to see and experience all of the truths that have already been documented in lawsuits and investigations,” she said. “But there’s something different when you actually get to see it and to connect with the people who are living the reality inside.”
Beth Shelburne, a co-producer of the film and an Alabama journalist who has covered the state’s prisons since 2012, wrote a series called Blood Money for the Alabama Reflector earlier this year. It explores some of the topics in the film, including a sharp rise since 2015 in use-of-force incidents in Alabama prisons and the spending of millions of dollars in public money to defend accused officers and settle lawsuits.

A visual statement

The filmmakers’ investigation into Alabama’s prison system began in 2019, three years after the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men and a year before the DOJ filed a lawsuit based on its findings.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

“The Alabama Solution” portrays circumstances the Justice Department details in its finding letters. The department found reasonable cause that conditions — including use of force — violate prisoners’ Eighth and 14th Amendment rights and amount to cruel and unusual punishment.
“It’s a continuous cycle of violence, a lack of accountability, and without us being able to inform society about what’s happening, these incidents are not even reported,” said Melvin Ray, an inmate and prison-reform activist in the film.
Robert Earl Council, an activist incarcerated in Alabama prisons who also goes by Kinetik Justice, calls the situation a humanitarian crisis. “We have record numbers of people leaving out of here in body bags,” he said in the film. “As long as ADOC [Alabama Department of Corrections] has control of the narrative, this society is never gonna understand or believe what’s really going on inside.”
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office deny that problems in the state’s prisons represent systemic constitutional violations, and the state has spent millions fighting the Justice Department’s lawsuit.
Kaufman said many of those who took risks to even participate in the documentary from prison found it important to share their faces as well as their voices.
“‘We want you to see all of us. We want you to see our entire story,’” Kaufman remembers Ray telling her when filmmakers asked if he would like to do a call without video. “It’s like, ‘Look, we’re still people. We’re still evolving. We’re still humans in here.’”
For more than a decade, a group of prisoners have been trying to tell their side of the story not only through cell phone videos but through legal actions. “The Alabama Solution” also documents those efforts.

Prisoner-led law classes

Halifax County is the name prisoners gave to a program that includes a self-taught law class. The Halifax County [North Carolina] Voters Movement in the 1960s organized nonviolent demonstrations advocating for Black voting rights, jury service and equal job opportunities. With the help of inmates who were Civil Rights Movement activists, incarcerated men started the Halifax County program to stand up for their rights inside prison.
“Halifax County brought a spark of hope, a spark of life,” Council says in the film, referring to the legal program. “Through our knowledge of the law, we were able to see more clearly things that were going on all around us that were not right.”
In the documentary, line drawings by a former inmate illustrate the group’s history and its work, which has involved filing numerous “pro se” lawsuits from inside prison. “Pro se,” the Latin term meaning “for oneself,” describes legal proceedings in which a person represents themselves, without a lawyer.
Halifax County participants say in film footage that ADOC responded to grievances and lawsuits prisoners filed by closing a prison law library and by retaliating against leaders of the group.
“That’s why these men are so brave to continue to believe in the power of journalism and the power of public knowledge,” Kaufman said. “As Melvin said to us, not in the film, but at one point, ‘I’m more afraid of what happens when they turn the cameras off.’”

Labor strike

The documentary also covers a 2022 work strike organized by people in prisons across the state. The strike gained media attention, but “The Alabama Solution” chronicles it in a different way — from the perspectives of the incarcerated, using videos they recorded at the time.
“What’s the absolute best way to beat the system where it’s going to hurt the most?” Ray asks in an organizing session the film documents. “You get them in the pocket. That hurts way more than hitting them in the mouth.”
Alabama prisons operated at 174% capacity in August, according to numbers published by ADOC. They operate with one-third of the necessary staff, according to statistics presented in the film, and depend on inmate labor to operate.
Data and information about Alabama’s prison system are interspersed on title cards throughout the film. One states that prisoners generate $450 million in goods and services for Alabama every year. Prisoners work both inside prisons and outside of them, for private companies.
“The state of Alabama continues to thrive on the bodies of Black, brown and poor white people,” Council says in the documentary. “The institution of slavery is real.”
Kaufman said people in prison are not only being asked to work practically for free but are being coerced into doing so.
“If you’re in a work-release camp and you decide that you don’t want to work, then you risk going back to one of the more maximum facility camps, where you might die or you might be placed in solitary confinement,” she said. “It’s beneficial for the companies because you have sort of a captive workforce that probably isn’t going to complain or isn’t going to put up a big fight about working conditions or working hours.”
Film footage during the strike shows prisoners talking about lack of food and unsanitary conditions, factors that led to the strike ending after three weeks.

Alabama’s solution? Build more prisons

The state’s main response to the ongoing DOJ lawsuit has been a plan to build more prisons. The film points out these new megaprisons, with an estimated price tag that has more than doubled from the 2021 projection of $1.3 billion, aren’t likely to affect overcrowding issues because they will replace existing prisons, leaving the number of beds unchanged.
Footage in the film shows Gov. Kay Ivey reiterating her support for using money from the state’s education fund to partially pay for the prisons.
The documentary also shows Ivey talking about an “Alabama Solution” to the state’s prison problems, invoking a local-control theme that has long been raised in the South, including during the Civil War and Civil Rights Movement, when the federal government or others outside the region try to address human-rights issues.
“It’s got to be an Alabama solution,” Ivey says in footage included in the film. “We cannot tolerate the alternative, which is having the DOJ take it over, turn folks loose. It’s our problem. We got to own it. We got to fix it.”

Database of deaths

While producers were working on the film, they watched the rate of deaths inside Alabama prisons double from 2019 numbers, Kaufman said. Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform group, estimates that 1,322 people died in Alabama prisons between 2019 and 2024.
The film looks into deaths of inmates besides Steven Davis, including that of Davis’ cellmate, James Sales. He had agreed to talk with Davis’ mother after he got out of prison. But he died one month before he was to be released.
“Most of the coincidences I run into don’t turn out to be coincidences,” says civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod during a scene in the film in which he reviews Sales’ autopsy report. Sherrod represented Sandy Ray in a lawsuit over Davis’ death.
Filmmakers also released a database with names and public information about deaths inside Alabama prisons.
“We kept track of all of the deaths, and we’ve created a database that pulls from multiple sources of data — federal, state, autopsies — and is informed by various sources across the institutions to track each of those deaths and try to get as much information about what caused all of those deaths as possible,” Kaufman said.
Those who worked on the documentary plan to update the database on a regular basis, she said.

Conversation starter

“The Alabama Solution” received critical acclaim after a showing at the Sundance Film Festival in January. The Montgomery premiere is among about 60 community screenings that are scheduled nationwide. Half are set for Alabama.
Kaufman said when prisons are secretive and people don’t know what’s happening inside them, it’s easy to assume they’re fulfilling their purpose of correcting behavior and improving public safety.
She said audiences will see that Alabama is spending around a quarter of the general state fund budget on institutions that are not meeting those expectations.
“Our hope is, on a very high level, to start a meaningful conversation about what we’re spending our tax dollars on and have that conversation be informed by the full picture of the harm that these systems are causing and how short they’re falling in terms of achieving the intended vision,” Kaufman said. “We’re also hoping that the public will engage with this material, and if they are moved by it, they will let their lawmakers know, ‘This is something we care about.’”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Men-lining-up-at-Easterling-for-Oct-13-2025-story-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

(Photo by Trevor Bexon/Getty Images)In June 2025, the Nevada Legislature passed A.B. 376, a bill that could fundamentally reshape Nevada’s property insurance system. Starting January 1, 2026, insurers will be permitted to exclude wildfire coverage from standard homeowners’ policies and offer it only as a separate, standalone product. As written, the legislation allows insurers to go even further by eliminating wildfire coverage entirely.
While the bill is intended to improve insurance availability in a high-risk environment, its provisions may leave many Nevada homeowners without essential protection. Some consumers may not realize that wildfire coverage is no longer included in their standard policies. Others may be unwilling or unable to pay for an additional policy. In the most extreme case, wildfire insurance could disappear from the market altogether, exposing thousands of homeowners to serious financial risk.
This legislative shift comes at a time when Nevada is facing increasing wildfire danger. Over the past four decades, wildfires have burned 18.5 percent of Nevada’s land, placing the state fifth in the nation for total land area affected. In 2018, the Martin and Sugarloaf Fires together scorched nearly one million acres. The Pinehaven Fire in Reno in 2020 destroyed five homes and damaged another dozen while residents of more than 1,300 homes were evacuated. In 2024, the Davis Fire in Washoe County destroyed 14 structures and forced the evacuation of 20,000 residents.
Meanwhile, housing development has rapidly expanded into high-risk areas. Between 1990 and 2020, the number of homes built in Nevada’s wildland-urban interface (WUI) grew by 208 percent. This was the fastest rate of WUI development in the country. As a result, many more Nevada homes are now located in areas where wildfire risk is highest. These structures add significant fuel to potential fires, making suppression more difficult and damage more extensive. Areas like the Reno-Tahoe region have seen especially fast growth, as Reno has quickly become the fourth-largest city in Nevada despite being located in one of the state’s highest-risk wildfire regions.
At the same time, the insurance market has become more volatile. Since 2018, Nevada homeowners have seen insurance rates rise by 21 percent. According to the 2025 Insurance Market Report by the Nevada Division of Insurance, in 2023, wildfire concerns led insurers to decline renewal for 481 homeowner policies, which represented an 82 percent increase from the previous year. That same year, total home insurance policy cancellations and non-renewals in Nevada surged to nearly 158,000, while insurer denials of coverage due to wildfire risk more than doubled.
In this context, lawmakers sought to keep insurers in the market by relaxing regulations. A.B. 376 allows companies to test new products outside of existing rules, accelerates approval of rate increases, and gives them more flexibility to manage wildfire risk. However, the bill does little to protect consumers or ensure transparency. Without adequate requirements for notification, many homeowners may not realize that their policies no longer include wildfire protection. Others may struggle to afford a separate policy, leaving them uninsured just as fire threats continue to rise.
Homeowners can take steps to reduce their vulnerability. It is essential to review insurance documents regularly and confirm directly with insurers whether wildfire coverage is included. Reducing ignition risks around homes by clearing vegetation and debris, especially within five feet of structures, is critically important. Strengthening homes with fire-resistant materials such as non-combustible roofing and upgraded vents can also make a meaningful difference. Neighborhood participation in the Firewise USA® recognition program is another way to improve community safety and may improve a home’s insurability. Firewise USA provides a voluntary process for neighbors to work together to reduce wildfire risks to their homes and surroundings. 
As Nevada confronts the growing threat of wildfire, the stakes for homeowners have never been higher. Insurance is a critical lifeline when disaster strikes. While lawmakers seek to address instability in the insurance market, effective solutions must balance the needs of the industry with consumer protections. Consumers must be educated about what is at stake. Without an understanding and stronger safeguards, too many Nevadans may find themselves underinsured or entirely unprotected when the next wildfire arrives. Moving forward, the state must ensure not only access to insurance, but access to coverage that protects the homes and lives most at risk.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1229661053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

Two people — Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43 — were killed in the shooting. Twelve other people were wounded. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)State Republicans had a consistent response to the awful shooting in Montgomery on Oct. 4.
From Gov. Kay Ivey down, Alabama’s white GOP elites lectured a majority-Black city about the importance of public safety.
“This simply should not be happening in our capital city or anywhere in our state for that matter,” Ivey said in the wake of the shooting.
And she’s right. It shouldn’t. But I’m not convinced that’s what they’re actually concerned about.
Power seems to be the real point of this “public safety” outrage.
What Montgomery’s critics seem to be angling for is a takeover of law enforcement in the city, akin to a proposal last year to have the governor and attorney general take over the Birmingham and Montgomery police departments. Under that proposal, a white Republican from Wilcox County and a white Republican from Marshall County would have controlled law enforcement in two majority-Black cities, denying Black residents input in their own governance.
It’s certainly not about public safety. No public safety plan is serious without a major effort to reduce the number of guns in the state. And so far, Ivey and her finger-wagging colleagues haven’t given us one.
Alabama has a gun problem. Our firearm death rates are some of the highest in the nation. In 2023, we lost 25.6 lives per 100,000 to gunfire, the fourth-highest rate in the United States. Over the last decade, Alabama has never ranker lower than fifth in the nation for gun violence.
You are more likely to lose your life to a bullet in Alabama than in New York, which is four times bigger than Alabama but has fewer gun deaths each year.
The difference is obvious. Gun laws.
New York state requires permits to carry concealed weapons. Dealers must run background checks at sale. Guns must be safely stored. New York forbids people from openly carrying guns in public. People can petition the courts to take the firearms of those who may be a threat to themselves or others.
Alabama does none of those things.
The Legislature has twice killed a bill from Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, to effectively require gun-owning parents to keep their weapons stored. Lawmakers approved a state Glock switch ban this year, which is good, but it was less a new regulation than a way to speed arrests. Legislators also passed a bill allowing people to voluntarily surrender their guns if they think they will be a threat to other people, a law that will likely be ineffective.
And none of those proposals can undo the decades of permissive gun policies that make horrors like the one in Montgomery possible. Even as they scolded Montgomery leadership over violence, Alabama’s leaders ignored their role in fomenting it.
“Unfortunately, I still feel the need for the state to further intervene in Montgomery and to have an even greater role in leading public safety efforts in our capital city,” said Ivey, who signed a law in 2022 making it much easier for people who don’t need guns to get them, and bragged about it.
“Though the blame lies with those who carelessly pulled the triggers, I continue to be troubled by the city leadership’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge they have a serious problem,” said Attorney General Steve Marshall, who was conspicuously silent in 2022 as Ivey and the Legislature got rid of concealed carry permit requirements, over the objections of sheriffs.
“Local leaders must be willing to lead in order to stop the crime and violence,” said Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth, who cheered on the flood of guns in 2022, saying that permit requirements aimed at protecting safety were just a “gun tax.”
Neither Ivey nor Marshall nor Ainsworth pulled the triggers in Montgomery. But deadly weapons end up in the wrong hands because Alabama’s Republican leaders think gun ownership is a right above all others, even the right to live without violence.
And whether you agree with Montgomery’s crime-fighting strategies, it’s clear the city takes the issue seriously. Montgomery has boosted the local police budget by more than 26% over the last six years. Mayor Steven Reed noted that Alabama’s lax gun laws are a major driver of the violence. He also noted that when the city last year tried to impose a minor gun restriction to address the carnage, state leaders forced Montgomery to repeal it.
You get used to hypocrisy in Alabama politics. The senator, allegedly concerned about free speech on college campuses, wants people at universities expressing views contrary to his to be jailed. The governor who thinks the world of Alabama’s workforce thinks a whole lot less of it the instant workers show the slightest lack of deference to their self-evidently benevolent employers.
That’s what you get with a state government built to thwart the public will, not reflect it. Power matters far more than truth or consistency.
And if you want to use Montgomery’s tragedy to extend your power over Black Alabamians, then a flood of gun violence that owes a lot to your recklessness is rather useful.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memorial-for-Oct-13-2025-column-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 09:01:57.723738

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source,"Located in Lordsburg, Lightning Dock is the only utility scale geothermal power plant in New Mexico. (BLM New Mexico via FlickrA recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.
But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?
Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.
This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.
This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.
Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.
“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.
He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.
It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.
That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.
Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.
Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.
“The really exciting possibility is what’s called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.
Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.
“Meaning you don’t have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.
Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.
Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.
Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.
In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.
There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.
The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.
By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.
Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.
“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).
Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.
“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”
New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.
In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.
Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.
“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we’re hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.
Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.
At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.
“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We’ve got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”
A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.
“I think it’s a hell of an idea, but it’s a ways out,” Woods said.
Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.
However, state analysts predict that fossil fuel production will start to decline sharply in the near future – maybe by 2035 – raising real questions about New Mexico’s plan to tackle the energy and economic gaps it will leave behind.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lordsburg-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

As a result, the state and its team made the decision to temporarily halt work. We are actively working with our partners and material suppliers to resolve these issues.”
Stoneburg did not elaborate on the issues. The department did not make staff available for an interview. Costs of the work were not immediately disclosed.
“Once resolved, and assuming favorable weather conditions, construction could be completed within a month,” Stoneburg said in his email.
“Our goal is to ensure that Lawyers Mall is fully restored and ready to welcome advocates, legislators, and the public to its full potential,” he wrote.
The monument has had its share of difficulties in recent years.

Designed by Maryland artist Toby Mendez, the memorial was dedicated in 1996. The 8-foot bronze statue of Marshall stands as the focal point.
Mendez incorporated the facade of the Department of Legislative Services Building — once the site of what was then the Maryland Court of Appeals where Marshall, as an attorney, argued the landmark Murray v. Pearson case that opened the University of Maryland School of Law to Black students.
Between the building and Marshall stood six columns. The placement gave the appearance of Marshall on the steps of a courthouse.
The memorial includes bronze statues seated on benches in front of Marshall.
On one bench, a statue of Donald Gaines Murray, the law student represented by Marshall. On another, the figures of two children represented in the Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka case. Marshall was the lead attorney in the landmark Supreme Court case cleared the way for desegregation of schools nationally by overturning the 19th century Plessy v. Ferguson case, which had established the “separate but equal” doctrine.
Atop the columns, an entablature inscribed “Equal Justice Under Law.” Important dates in Marshall’s career lie in a circle in the mall at Marshall’s feet.
The memorial was disassembled and removed in 2018 to allow for work on utilities running under the plaza.
Some pieces — the columns and entablatures — were stored, according to Chris Kintzel, director of the Maryland Commission on Artistic Property.
Oversight of the monument is complicated.
The commission is responsible for the statue of Marshall as well as the figures seated on the benches. The columns, entablature and other features fall under the purview of the Department of General Services.
“It’s not exactly like art hanging on a wall,” Kintzel said
The bronze statue of Marshall was moved temporarily to the entrance of the Robert C. Murphy Court of Appeals Building.
The statue and memorial returned to Lawyers Mall in late 2020, and were rededicated in 2021. But the next year,the columns and entablature had to be taken down after it was discovered they had been damaged.

“The colonnade which serves as the backdrop to the Thurgood Marshall statue in Lawyers Mall was disassembled when concerns over certain cracks were deemed to be a potential safety risk,” Stoneburg wrote.
“While evaluating the disassembled columns to identify a potential cause for the cracks, a decision was made not to reconstruct the monument while the adjacent Legislative Services Building was being constructed to prevent potential damage from heavy equipment vibrations,” he wrote. “During this time, additional maintenance updates to help preserve this important landmark for years to come were also identified and are currently being implemented.”
One of those changes involves improving the engravings of the court cases and significant cases that are part of the paved area around the statue. Some of those engravings have suffered from time, weather, and foot traffic.
“They really wanted to emphasize the engravings and his cases with a deeper cut — trying to make it more legible,” Kintzel said. “Over time, it became hard to read some of the lettering of the cases. They began to fade over time. With this new deeper cut, the new methodology, the lettering should remain legible for a much, much, much, much longer time.”
The cracks in the columns — some significant — were discovered at the same time workers were demolishing and replacing the adjacent Department of Legislative Services Building.
The exact cause of the damage to the columns is not clear. But experts noted at the time that the monument was not designed to be disassembled and reassembled.
“Although studies were conducted to determine the cause of the original structural failure, the findings were not fully conclusive,” Stoneburg said. “The State continues to work collaboratively with the original construction team to refine the reconstruction details and ensure long-term success.”
Not all of the pieces of the reconstructed memorial will be original.
“As part of the reconstruction, the original columns — deemed too damaged to reuse — have been replaced,” Stoneburg wrote. “The new columns, fabricated to match the original profile, were designed as two-piece units instead of the original three-piece configuration. However, the original entablatures that sit atop each set of three columns have been preserved and will be reinstalled as part of the reconstruction.”
Also new to the mall: a modern Department of Legislative Services Building. The new 144,000 square-foot building was officially opened in January.
“The expanded Lawyers Mall has definitely created a much greater access to the plaza, it’s more secure…and when the columns and everything are back in place, it will then help reframe the idea that here is a space where history took place, and it will be better framed now that the new building is complete and the new bases and columns will be in place,” Kintzel said.
State officials worked with Mendez, the artist, to ensure his vision of the memorial remained.
“They consulted with Tony on the new building, so that it would still look proportional and look like it was originally intended,” Kintzel said. “So, it still has the idea of it being in the spot where, where the old Court of Appeals was, where Marshall would have been when he argued his landmark cases.”

Hoover, chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The company behind the proposed Piedmont power line is pushing Maryland regulators to evaluate the project more quickly than planned, arguing that delays will jeopardize the power grid.
The company, PSEG Renewable Transmission, is opposing a procedural schedule issued by the Maryland Public Service Commission, which plans to review the project until at least February 2027.
PSEG argues that the commission’s schedule will make it impossible to reach a deadline for placing the power line in service by June 2027, which was set by the operator of the region’s electric grid, PJM Interconnection.
“PJM set the in-service date to prevent specific impending reliability violations,” wrote PSEG attorney J. Joseph Curran, III, in a letter to the commission. “Unless these violations are addressed, PJM has determined that overall system reliability in the PJM region — including in Maryland — could be compromised, and the PJM region could be exposed to widespread and extreme conditions, such as system collapse and blackouts.”
The commission, by contrast, has expressed confidence that the electric grid will remain well-managed while it deliberates about the transmission line.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

In his letter to the commission, Curran also requested that it establish a target date to issue a final order on the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the power line project is known. An end date would help the company more efficiently coordinate with other state and federal permitting agencies, plan construction activities, and negotiate with landowners, he wrote.
But in a statement Friday, Tori Leonard, a spokesperson for the commission, said it is “unlikely” to place an end cap on the proceedings by setting a target date for a final order. The commission’s schedule ends in February 2027 with a deadline for the parties to submit their final briefs.
The commission will ultimately decide whether the controversial power line receives a “Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity,” authorizing its construction. But the process has already been mired in delays, largely because of intense pushback from landowners in the line’s path, and other community members and elected officials in the impacted jurisdictions.
Because of landowner denials, PSEG had to go to court to get a federal district judge to order temporary access to hundreds of properties for environmental surveys, which it will need in order to get a final ruling from the commission.
Those surveys are well underway, though landowners have appealed. On Thursday, the company filed suit against a third round of defiant landowners, requesting access to 64 additional parcels.
By comparison, in his Oct. 7 letter, Curran said the company has obtained voluntary access agreements for 52 parcels along the proposed route.
The proposed line would stretch 67 miles through largely rural areas in Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, connecting a power substation near the Pennsylvania line with a substation in Frederick County.
The project was commissioned by grid operator PJM alongside a host of other projects meant to relieve problems in a strained grid, caused in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers and expected retirements of fossil fuel generating stations.
In a statement shortly after the Maryland Commission issued its schedule for the Piedmont line, PJM spokesman Jeff Shields said that “PJM has identified extensive, severe, and widespread reliability violations that PJM expects to occur as soon as June 2027 if these projects are not built on the prescribed schedule, leaving the entire system more exposed to reliability risks, including power outages.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shields noted that Maryland will be “additionally challenged to meet local demand from local sources” given the planned retirements of the Brandon Shores and Wagner power plants, which are currently operating solely because of “must run” agreements with the grid.
In its news release announcing the scheduling order on Sept. 11, the commission highlighted that PSEG submitted its application for the certification in late December 2024, as opposed to fall 2024 as planned.
In his letter to the commission, Curran pushed back, arguing that the New-Jersey based power company only submitted in December because it decided to conduct additional public hearings in November 2024.
In requesting an end date for the proceedings, Curran argued that it would help expedite the permits that PSEG would likely only be able to obtain after a decision on the certificate of public convenience, including from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the impacted counties.
“Having a final order date in the procedural schedule is necessary so that the Company can have plans in place to ensure the Project goes into service as soon as practical to meet critical reliability needs,” Curran wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DSC_0282-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)States are doing what they generally do during a federal government shutdown: Continuing to operate programs serving some of the neediest people.
That means schools are still serving federally subsidized meals and states are distributing funding for the federal food stamp program. For now.
If the shutdown drags on and federal dollars run out, states can only keep programs going for so long. States may choose to pay for some services themselves so residents keep their benefits.
But while it’s traditionally been the practice to reimburse states for federal costs once the shutdown ends, state leaders have new worries about whether that will be the case this time. The Trump administration’s record of pulling funding and targeting Democratic-led states has some officials worried about what comes after the shutdown.
Many states already struggled to balance their own budgets this year. And some fear going without federal reimbursement for shutdown costs could force states to make painful cuts to their own budget priorities.
Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, a Democrat, said the administration has not made good on its word to states in recent months — freezing some congressionally approved funding and cutting already awarded grants. So it’s likewise unclear whether the federal government will follow previous practice and reimburse states for covering shutdown costs of crucial federal programs such as food assistance.
“I think everything is a risk with this administration…. We in the states are kind of left holding the bag yet again as the federal government tries to sort out what it wants to be when it grows up,” Conine told Stateline.

Nevada entered the shutdown with more than $1.2 billion in reserves. Last week, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office said in a statement that state funds would be adequate to cover “a short period of time with minimal disruption to services.”
But the governor’s office said a shutdown of more than 30 days would cause more significant challenges for the state.
Lombardo’s office did not respond to Stateline’s questions. But on Oct. 1, when the shutdown started, it released a three-page document on the shutdown, saying it expected the federal government to reimburse states once the budget stalemate is resolved.
“As D.C. works through its issues, our administration will continue to support Nevadans in any way we can throughout this unnecessary federal government shutdown,” Lombardo said in the statement.
While mandatory programs such as Medicaid and Social Security continue to send funds to beneficiaries during the shutdown, funding for other safety net programs such as food assistance are more uncertain. The federal government told states there were enough funds for the food stamp program to cover October benefits, though the special Women, Infants and Children food program may run out of money sooner.
By furloughing workers and halting federal spending, the shutdown could cost the national economy $15 billion per week, President Donald Trump’s economic advisers estimated.
The White House says a prolonged shutdown will affect the economies of every state by reducing employment, federal benefits and consumer spending. White House estimates say this could cost Michigan $361 million per week in lost economic output, for example, while Florida could lose $911 million each week.
‘Fend for themselves’
Some federal services are shuttered during a shutdown: The Environmental Protection Agency has ceased many research, permitting and enforcement efforts, and official jobs data is no longer being released. Federal funds for other programs, including food assistance, are expected to last through the end of the month. But states can elect to spend their own funds on these programs, which were previously authorized by Congress and state legislatures.










There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown. There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.


– Lisa Parshall, professor of political science at Daemen University in New York


Before the shutdown, states were stockpiling reserve funding. The National Association of State Budget Officers reported most state budgets this year maintained or increased rainy day funds. At the same time, state and local governments are borrowing record amounts: As much as $600 billion in municipal bonds is projected to be issued by the end of 2025.
“So states and localities are kind of getting the message they really need to fend for themselves much more than they ever had,” said William Glasgall, public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that works to support public sector workers.
Since January, the Trump administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Glasgall said that record leaves states with legitimate concerns about getting repaid for their shutdown-related expenses — a prospect that would likely spark even more lawsuits from Democratic-led states.
“They’ve already, before the shutdown, started rolling back federal funding, and I don’t see any reason why they would stop now,” he said. “The recissions that have been announced are pretty harsh, and it’s money we’re expecting and not getting.”
The last shutdown, which lasted five weeks during Trump’s first term, delayed billions in federal spending and reduced gross domestic product — the value of all goods and services produced — by $11 billion, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2019. Experts say states were repaid for costs they incurred providing federal services during that shutdown.
In Minnesota, State Budget Director Ahna Minge said staff have been studying previous shutdowns. But at a news conference with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz last week, she characterized this shutdown as “unpredictable.”
“The current federal administration may not follow the historic playbook,” she said.
Walz said farmers would be among the first hit as the federal Farm Service Agency has ceased operations in the middle of the state’s harvest season. Among other duties, that agency works on disaster assistance and processes loans during harvest to protect farmers against commodity price fluctuations.

Minge said Minnesota officials think programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP] and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children have enough existing federal funds to operate through October. But she said the state budget cannot backfill all the commitments made by federal programs.
“What we know is that the longer a shutdown lasts, the greater the impact to state programs and services,” she said.
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has pledged to use state dollars to keep WIC afloat if needed, the Associated Press reported. And  Colorado lawmakers set aside $7.5 million just before the shutdown to keep WIC running.
Already under strain
In Maryland, the shutdown is compounding economic instability from Trump’s ongoing efforts to shrink the number of federal employees, agencies and spending.
With more than 260,000 federal employees, Maryland’s economy relies heavily on the federal workforce. The Trump administration has said it may deny back pay to hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers, despite a law he signed in 2019 guaranteeing such back pay.
Chief Deputy Comptroller Andrew Schaufele told lawmakers on Sept. 30 that a shutdown could cost the state $700,000 per day in lost tax revenue.
Democratic Gov. Wes Moore pledged to continue funding some federal programs, but said the state would not tap into its Rainy Day fund to do so.
“We’re going to continually evaluate how long we can go,” he said at a news conference.
As for getting repaid, Moore spokesperson David Turner told Stateline that the state had received no indication that the federal government would deviate from past practice, “but we are monitoring closely.”
This fiscal uncertainty hits states as they are already struggling to respond to the strain of federal agency layoffs and cuts in the major tax and spending law Trump signed this summer. That law slashed billions in social service funding and created costly new bureaucratic burdens for states, which administer Medicaid and food assistance programs.
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

“There’s no way, really at this point, to sort of assess with any level of confidence what’s going to happen when you also have these massive layoffs that were going on pre-shutdown,” said Lisa Parshall, a professor of political science at Daemen University in New York. “There’s just a real sense from states and localities — and I think rightly so — that that kind of reliability of the federal government is now in question.”
It may not be a question of whether states are reimbursed for their shutdown expenses, but which states are reimbursed, Parshall said. The Trump administration has publicly targeted funding of liberal-led states and cities over policy disagreements, raising the possibility it could do something similar with the shutdown.
“Whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, you know, you could argue,” she said. “But it’s definitely a thing that seems to be adding to this level of uncertainty — this shutdown feels different.”
In California, officials just closed a nearly $12 billion shortfall when negotiating the budget that was approved in June. The budget deficit is expected to grow to more than $17 billion next year, said H.D. Palmer, spokesperson for the State of California Department of Finance, which advises the governor and state agencies on budget issues.
“There isn’t a long-term, open-ended line of credit available if this drags out,” he said of the federal government shutdown.
The depth of reserve funds available varies by federally funded program, he said. CalFresh, California’s name for its SNAP program, has enough funds to cover food stamp benefits for this month, but anything beyond that is uncertain.
“If the duration of this is in the matter of days, it will be an inconvenience, but should not pose a massive problem,” he said. “However, if it does drag out for an extended period of time, then clearly it’s going to be a problem.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)State auditors have referred their investigation of credit card use by a worker at the State Department of Assessments and Taxation to the criminal division of the attorney general’s office, after finding questionable purchases by the employee and lax oversight by department managers.
The Office of Legislative Audits report released last week said its investigation was sparked by a tip to its fraud, waste and abuse hotline concerning questionable corporate purchasing card (CPC) purchases involving an individual employed at DAT’s headquarters during the period from May 2019 through August 2024.
It found that not only had the employee made questionable purchases, including questionable CPC payments made on behalf of two senior management employees at SDAT, but that there were problems with the agency’s internal controls “that enabled questionable activity to do undetected.”
The report said that 37 SDAT employees had corporate cards, and they made 7,649 purchases worth $2.3 milion from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2025. The targeted individual was responsible for 530 payments during that time, totaling $118,000.
The employee submitted 230 payments, worth $41,400, without receipts and another 16, worth $1,400, that came with illegible receipts. When documentation was available, the agency, and later the auditors, found some questionable expenses like $376 paid to one vendor for items that included dog food and steaks; and $190 for items that included “tumblers, nail polish and other personal items.”

	The audit also found that the employee paid about $6,800 for two rental properties in Ocean City in August 2022, apparently at the direction of two management employees attending a conference there from Aug. 17-20. But the report noted that the rentals were for the entire week of Aug. 13-20 and were made in each case for two adults and two children. It said SDAT could not provide justification for the extra nights, or show whether costs of the vacation property were consitent with standard hotel costs for the resort at that time of year.
SDAT said it identified the questionable expenses by the employee while preparing for a 2024 audit by the comptroller’s office, and after identifying $300 in questionable payments — for personal utilities, gas and phone bills — it fired the employee in August 2024. The agency said it stopped its investigation then, since $300 is the threshold for terminating a worker.
But auditors said SDAT could not provide documentation of that investigation, and that when it fired the employee it failed to process it as a “termination with prejudice” — meaning that the employee would have been eligible to be rehired by another state agency.
Auditors said a search of state employment records showed that the person has not been hired by another state agency, and SDAT has since reprocessed the firing to reflect that it was done “with prejudice.”
Even though state law requires that agencies “immediately refer any instances of possible criminal or unethical conduct by an employee” to the attorney general’s office and to the governor’s chief legal counsel, SDAT did not do so, the auditors said. Nor did it seek to recover the questionable payments it uncovered.
In his reply, SDAT Director Bob Yeager agreed with all the findings of the audit and said his agency has taken steps to correct the problems identified in it, including referring the matter to the attorney general and reviewing all agency termination notices to make sure they were properly classified.
Yeager also said the agency has developed a training program for corporate card holders and required refreshers for current card holders, improved processes for approving purchases and reviewing purchase logs, and clarified the proper response when issues are found.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_5903-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

(Photos by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle and Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) In the coming days, a food aid program that helps millions of mothers and young children will likely run out of money. States like Indiana must use their own dollars to keep funds flowing to families or let it lapse, a move that could cut benefits for the 157,000 Hoosiers who rely on the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC.
But the Indiana Department of Health declined to share specifics about how WIC would operate in the state, saying that “funds have been identified to keep WIC operating as normal for the foreseeable future.”
“IDOH continues to monitor the situation, and WIC is operating as normal,” said Greta Sanderson, the chief communications officer for the agency.
But advocates warn of the potential impacts to Hoosier mothers — including those who are pregnant — and children relying on government services like WIC if such funds ran out.

“It’s providing nutrition to a population where nutrition is critical for development,” said Emily Weikert Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry. “… no matter what, our member food banks will continue to be there for communities and for our neighbors who are in need of food assistance.”
Bryant said other food benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, appeared to have steady funding in the coming weeks alongside WIC. However, SNAP is reportedly also running out of money even as the Trump administration explores using tariff revenue to fund WIC. 
In a preliminary estimate on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, 156,752 Hoosiers received benefits from WIC in May 2025, the latest data available. Of those, more than half — 87,000, or 56% — were children while infants and mothers each made up 22% of Indiana’s total, or roughly 35,000. 
Between October 1, 2024 — the beginning of the federal fiscal year — and May, the federal government allotted nearly $80 million to Indiana’s WIC program, $24 million of which went to administrative costs. 
Some states are reportedly chipping in their own funds to keep the program running, including Mississippi, Colorado and Connecticut. Other states, like Washington, say they don’t have money available.
The program is one of thousands funded by the federal government, which has had its funding frozen since Oct. 1. Most government offices continue to function as normal during the partisan budget standoff, but cracks are beginning to show — and Hoosiers will be dealing with the consequences. 
Already, a key federal jobs report was delayed and fewer staff are at the state’s only federal park in northern Indiana, though it remains open through the shutdown.
 Other programs impacted by the shutdown

Indiana is slightly more dependent on federal funding than the average state, with 40% of the state’s budget coming from Washington, D.C. compared to 36% for all 50 states, according to Pew. The nonprofit notes that federal programs have rolling deadlines for funding to expire, meaning that some programs don’t need additional appropriations for a few more years.
Gov. Mike Braun’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications Molly Craft spoke generally about the federal shutdown’s impact on state services last week: “We are in good shape.”
“Let’s see how long this goes. We have smart people leading different agencies — we’ll work out with them the details to try to make sure Hoosiers are served well, despite whatever may happen in D.C.,” she said.
Indiana education officials said the immediate effects of a federal government shutdown on K-12 schools will likely be limited — at least at first.
Courtney Bearsch, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Education, said the department “is continuing the normal operations of programs funded by federal grants,” given that a majority of IDOE’s federal funding is already authorized for the 2025-2026 school year. 
“If the shutdown lasts for an extended period,” Bearsch added, “IDOE will re-evaluate the situation, along with our state-level partners.”
Because most federal grants to schools were awarded over the summer, the U.S. Department of Education expects minimal disruption to day-to-day district operations. 
Federal officials said Title I funds, which support schools with higher concentrations of students in poverty, and funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act will continue to flow. But the agency will halt new grantmaking, pause its advisory and regulatory activities, and stop investigations into alleged civil rights violations during the shutdown.
The federal education department will also continue processing Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms, which colleges and universities rely on to assemble financial aid packages.
Still, the pause in government services could be felt sooner in certain Indiana districts that rely on Impact Aid — a federal program that supports school systems on or near federal lands, such as military installations, which can’t be taxed locally. Those payments are made directly to schools, not through the state, and typically arrive later in the calendar year. 
Bearsch said IDOE is not notified when schools receive Impact Aid payments, but noted that last year’s funding went out in December.
The National Association of Federally Impacted Schools warned on Friday that “districts are facing an immediate and significant cash-flow crisis” if payments are delayed.
Six Indiana school districts received Impact Aid in fiscal year 2025, totaling more than $900,000, according to NAFIS.
Those included: Bartholomew Consolidated School Corp., $261,886; Bloomfield School District, $23,669; Loogootee School Corporation, $303452; Madison Consolidated Schools, $81,796; Perry Central Community School Corp., $167,208; and South Ripley Community School Corp., $76,487. 
It’s not clear how much funding districts are expecting for the current fiscal year.
 Federal employees

But, as Pew notes, shutdowns also halt government services such as rulemaking, grantmaking and technical assistance — impacting the employees tasked with reviewing Medicaid waivers, transportation planning and environmental grants.
At least 600,000 federal employees could be suspended, depending on each agency’s definition of who qualifies as essential. Indiana has roughly 25,000 federal employees within its borders.

Many employees are expected to work without pay, including the country’s troops, immigration agents and air traffic controllers. Friday’s paycheck — which covers the pay period from Sept. 24 to Oct. 7 — was the first partial payment since the shutdown began.

Homeland Security: 176 employees
Treasury: 1,446 employees

Staffing issues at several airports have caused delays nationwide, from California’s Hollywood Burbank Airport to Newark, New Jersey. Some airports with zero flight controllers for several hours cancelled flights.
Though the Indianapolis airport hasn’t yet had a delay reported to the National Airspace System due to its staff, any change in any part of the greater system has a ripple effect. 
In past shutdowns, employees who are furloughed were guaranteed backpay — but a draft White House memo shared with Axios floats the possibility that the Trump administration may reverse that precedent. 
Bryant, with Feeding Indiana’s Hungry, pointed to increasing levels of food insecurity, saying that the greater Feeding America network — whose donation page explicitly mentions supporting families during the shutdown — anticipates increased demand in the coming weeks.
“This shutdown creates uncertainty for millions of civilian and military federal employees and employees of federal contractors,” said Bryant. “All of whom are at risk of paycheck disruptions and maybe not getting back pay.
“Many of these hard-working folks are just one paycheck away from needing support from their local food bank or pantry.”
Families in need can download the Community Compass app to locate food resources, including free groceries or meals, stores participating in SNAP, WIC clinics and more.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-10-13 11:14:34+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Columbus is now an Italian American myth. Let’s name the day after someone else.,Jen A. Miller,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/10/13/rename-columbus-day/,Writer Jen A. Miller says she's proud of her Italian American heritage — but thinks Columbus Day in name has to go.,"Writer Jen A. Miller says Italian Americans can celebrate their heritage without honoring Christopher Columbus. (Photo by David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)While living in Italy this summer, I made a trip to Genoa to see Christopher Columbus’s birthplace. It’s a small building, and wasn’t very crowded. The guide spent more time describing a structure in the courtyard, which to him held more historical significance than the house itself. 
This might surprise Americans, given the brouhaha about Columbus Day here. But like pasta primavera and the Feast of the Seven Fishes, Columbus Day is largely an Italian American invention. We should rename the holiday to reflect that it’s about us, and not some long-dead guy whose “discovery” led to the deaths of millions.
Yes, of course, Italians recognize that Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1492. In Italy, it’s called Giornata nazionale di Cristoforo Colombo, but it’s not a national holiday and certainly doesn’t carry the same pomp and circumstance as the dozens of saint-dedicated feast days celebrated at different levels of intensity, depending on where you are in the country.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

Columbus Day celebrations started here in 1792, and were pushed as a way to combat then-intense anti-Italian and anti-Catholic sentiments. Most of this work was done at the state level until 1891, when 11 Italian immigrants were lynched in New Orleans. In 1892, the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s first voyage, President Benjamin Harris made Columbus Day a one-time, national thing. 
The big movement to make it a national holiday came in 1934 at the behest of the Knights of Columbus, which led to a proclamation by Franklin D. Roosevelt — but not a national holiday (this was the same president who oversaw the internment of nearly 2,000 Italians during World War II). The federal holiday designation came in 1971, set for the second Monday in October.
By this time, Columbus Day was less about a man whose four voyages to the Americas led to the genocide of indigenous peoples and the creation of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and more about a mythologized figure who served as a backdrop for recognizing the accomplishments and contributions Italian immigrants have made to this country. 
The current pro-Columbus Day push is part of a larger backlash against any gains made since 2020 by people who are not straight, white Christian males. In April, President Trump said that Columbus Day needs to make a “major comeback” despite it never going away, and last week signed a proclamation to reclaim the explorer’s legacy. Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli has pledged to “save” Columbus Day — which, again, hasn’t disappeared in a cloud of rainbow-colored woke smoke. 
This summer, the “Columbus Heritage Coalition,” a group who says its mission is to support the celebration of Columbus Day and has a map on its website targeting communities that have renamed the holiday, used an old tweet by New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani opposing the presence of a Columbus statue to try to hurt his election chances by saying he’s “exclusionary” for wanting to take it down.
Mamdani is Muslim and was born in Uganda, so it’s not a surprise that he’d become a target of people using Columbus as a conduit to point at someone else and scream they are now the “other.” It’s part of a long tradition of those who were once persecuted becoming the aggressor. 
It’s not like I’m not proud to be Italian. I’ve been learning the language for more than three years, and on this past summer trip, I rented a Fiat 500 and drove up a steep mountain on tiny, twisty roads to meet the branch of my Italian family who still live there. I didn’t do these things for my health. I did so because where I come from is important to me.
But Columbus Day in name has to go. If we want to keep the holiday but rename it after someone with questionable values, that’s fine. Pick an actual Italian American. Let’s rename the second Monday in October Frank Sinatra Day. At least he won an Oscar.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: The race for NJ governor]A déjà vu campaign in South Jersey is shaping up to be one of the most contested and closely watched Statehouse races this year, with four candidates who sought Assembly seats in 2023 in the 8th Legislative District facing off again.
Democrat Andrea Katz pulled off a surprise upset two years ago when she ousted Republican incumbent Brandon Umba. Now, Umba is back on the campaign trail in an effort to retake the seat. Katz’s 2023 running mate, Anthony Angelozzi, is running alongside her again, while incumbent Assemblyman Michael Torrissi Jr. is Umba’s running mate once more.
Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship at Rowan University, called the race a true toss-up and “a wonderful expression of democracy.”
“You have qualified candidates running against each other with different visions out there, trying to engage as many voters as they can. Yay. Kudos to America, because that’s what it should be,” Dworkin said. “You have other places where as long as you win the primary, you can go to sleep and just wake up after Election Day and you’ve won. This is not one of those districts. This is a very tough district.”
While incumbents typically win and name recognition boosts a candidate’s odds, all four candidates in this race have the advantage of name recognition, while three of the four have Assembly experience, Dworkin noted. This is one of only two districts statewide represented in the Assembly by one Republican and one Democrat.

The 2023 race was so close on election night — with less than 500 votes between Torrissi, the top vote-getter, and Umba, in last place — that Katz appeared to concede the next day. It took a week before election officials instead confirmed her as a winner, after all vote-by-mail and provisional ballots were counted.
Dworkin predicts this year’s race will boil down to who knocks on the most doors and engages the most voters face-to-face in this sprawling district — among the largest statewide by area — that covers parts of Burlington and Atlantic counties.
“I think it’s going to turn significantly on individual relationships: How many voters have met these candidates, shaken their hand, had them knock on their doors, made a personal call, not just from campaign staff, but from the candidates themselves?” Dworkin said.
All four candidates said such personal interactions have been their chief campaign strategy.
Angelozzi said he’s knocked on 6,300 doors and aims to hit 8,000 to 9,000 by Election Day on Nov. 4. Katz said she’s been similarly busy.
“My knees are aching. I’m exhausted. There’s muscles in my legs that I didn’t know existed,” Katz said. “But that’s how we do it. We just talk to people, and then we trust that the voters are going to do what’s best for them.”
A battle against colon cancer kept Torrissi largely sidelined during the 2023 campaign, but this year is different, he said.
“I am completely healthy now. I’ve never been working so hard,” he said.
All 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year.
 Affordability and utilities

All four candidates say affordability is their top issue.

Torrissi, who owns a trucking company, pointed to New Jersey’s highest-in-the-nation property taxes, crippling health care costs, and skyrocketing utility bills as complaints he has heard from voters.
“Everybody seems to be wanting to leave New Jersey,” Torrissi said. “I don’t want to have to leave New Jersey. I want to stay here. And it really comes down to affordability.”
Immigration and supporting police also are top concerns for Torrissi, who said he does not support the sanctuary policies of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration. He said his parents were Italian immigrants and that he’s a “pro-immigrant person.”
“I represent everybody. But we want to make sure they’re here legally, and we don’t have criminals,” Torrissi said. “Do it the right way.”
Umba, who is township administrator in Southampton Township, said he wants to fix the school funding formula and make the state “energy independent” by expanding natural gas and renewable energy sources rather than relying on out-of-state energy sources.
“That’s what’s driving up costs,” Umba said.
Angelozzi teaches 10th grade history at Hammonton High School, heads the Hammonton Education Association, and works as a contract negotiator and union organizer for the New Jersey Education Association. He said New Jersey residents are “desperate for relief.”
“Voters want answers. They don’t know why the bills are going up. I feel it myself. My wife and I are schoolteachers. We don’t get paid in the summer. So when those monster electric bills come to our house, it is a stressor,” Angelozzi said.
Angelozzi and Katz, a stay-at-home mother of three and former president of the Chesterfield Democrats, also list as priorities education, school funding, reproductive rights, and “results-oriented” policymaking instead of the bitter partisanship and division that now dominate politics.
“People just want us to go to work and make their lives better. They want the simple things in life. They see the chaos in government, and what I hear is: ‘Can you go and be my voice and be a sane person in government for me?’ Yes, yes I can,” Katz said.

 Turnout key

The district has shifted slightly to the right since its Assembly seats were last on the ballot, with the GOP picking up about 2,000 voters and the Democrats losing about 25 since 2023.

Torrissi and Umba hope the change will help them secure a win. Angelozzi remains undaunted. He pointed out that Katz toppled Umba in 2023 even though Republicans have largely dominated legislative races in this district. Unaffiliated voters also outnumber those registered to either major party in the district, with almost 64,630 unaffiliated voters in June compared to nearly 58,300 registered Republicans and 57,500 registered Democrats, state data shows.
Turnout is typically low in off-year elections, with just 27% of New Jersey voters casting ballots in 2023, compared to 65% in 2024’s presidential election, state data shows. But the governor’s race could juice turnout next month if the 2021 gubernatorial race is any indication — 40% of registered voters cast ballots in that election, data shows.
Voters now have three ways to vote — in person on Election Day, in person at early voting locations beginning Oct. 25, and by mail, which is already underway, Dworkin noted.
“Right now, on both sides in this campaign, they are chasing down ballots,” Dworkin said. “But I can’t tell you who’s going to win this thing.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Schneider: Vaccines are value — echoes from the past.","This commentary is by David Schneider, DO, MS-HCT, FAAP, of Rutland. Schneider is a board-certified Vermont pediatrician with a master’s degree in health care transformation. 
I am likely correct that no person reading this has seen smallpox.
It has been nearly 90 years since the last isolated report of a Vermonter ill with this dreaded, disfiguring, often life-stealing disease.
After the 1928 Vermont epidemic, spurred by lax vaccination, the Vermont Department of Health instituted a highly successful immunization campaign. 1929 ended with a near-eradication of smallpox in our state.
Most Americans in the 1920s received plenty of exercise and sleep. Alcohol was prohibited. Meals were whole food, fresh and devoid of microplastics — yet life expectancy averaged around 50 years. Illness and death from smallpox, influenza, pneumonias, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tuberculosis, strep and other infectious diseases were common. Today, many of these infections are prevented or mitigated due to medical advances, foremost immunizations. However, many pathogens are on opportunistic standby.

On May 14, 1796, Dr. Edward Jenner successfully administered his new smallpox vaccine. The vaccine arrived in the U.S. in 1800. Despite concerns at the time that people would turn into cows, vaccine delivery increased and smallpox outbreaks decreased. By 1949, smallpox no longer existed on American soil.
To reiterate: There has been zero, zilch, nada, none, no smallpox in the U.S. since 1949 and was declared eradicated from the planet in 1980. The nearly 100% effective vaccine had saved countless lives.
Vermonters on the whole embrace immunization. While there has been a recent decline in immunization rates, we are not yet seeing an impact on public health. There is a fine line, however. For example, the established goal for community protection against measles is a 95% immunization rate. Vermont is presently at about 94%. Measles is so contagious that only a few percentage points below the 95% immunization goal sacrifices our protections.
Families share that they are struggling, attempting to discern accurate information from a recent deluge of misinformation, disinformation and flagrant malinformation about vaccines. Health care professionals take our responsibilities to heart and will not be dispirited by the recent environment of fabricated anti-vaccination propaganda. On the contrary, we are more dedicated than ever to empathetically maintain our trusting relationships with patients as we help address immunization questions.
In a conversation with Merideth Plumpton, the Immunization Program Manager with the Vermont Department of Health, she spoke about her concern for families that are at loss when it comes to finding accurate vaccine information. Still, she reminds me that it’s amazing to live in a state that follows science. We have a history of health commissioners who always put science first; we have a governor who is willing to say that vaccines “are the best way to prevent serious illness.”
Dr. Anna McCloy, a Rutland pediatrician, shares, “What I love is when patients are honest about their biggest vaccine fears. I can work with them.” She has noticed a misguided trend: the belief that “whole foods, healthy habits and loving our kids will protect them.” History demonstrates that these behaviors are important, but they are incomplete when it comes to infectious pathogens. Immunizations are an important part of healthy living.
Immunization recommendations and schedules will change from time to time. As with all vaccines, recommendations to administer or to discontinue immunization are based upon epidemiology and scientific evidence measuring the benefits of vaccination against any potential risks. This is the standard that has successfully held true. Independent, apolitical, trained, experienced, logical, methodical scientific review and expertise assessing vaccine benefits relative to any potential risk must always dictate recommendations.
There is no conspiracy. There are no big-dollar incentives. There is no deep-state attempt to control and manipulate genes. There is no activation of autism. There is no human-to-cow metamorphosis. Immunizations are a gift of successful medical achievements contributing to a healthy life, family and community. Immunizations are health care of value.
Please immunize. Save lives.

Minnesota has reported 20 measles cases this year, with all recent cases in unvaccinated people.
Measles is a highly contagious illness that, before the 1960s, nearly all children contracted and from which tens of thousands were hospitalized every year. Thanks to decades of widespread vaccination, it was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, though the number of measles cases in 2025 — the highest in three decades — is now threatening that status.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Trump administration cuts to government programs and downsizing of the civil service workforce have altered the public sector substantially. This has been well reported, but the consequences of these changes on the private, not-for-profit sector, has not received as much attention.
The federal bureaucracy is an easy target for its critics. It has no coherent master plan. It began with core duties of any country (defense, diplomacy, treasury) but then had manage the geographic growth of the country. Then industrialization often erased state borders and federalized many policy areas. At key moments, constituency groups like veterans, labor groups, agricultural interests etc. requested government attention and regulatory agencies developed from periodic market failures, new technologies, or to quash discrimination. The resulting crazy quilt of agencies and departments is easy for critics to question.
Further, just as the federal government grew, significant corruption reforms led to civil servants being hired based on their expertise rather than political allegiance. The resulting neutral competence is beneficial, but does collide with principles that presidential elections provide clear mandates to govern. We both want neutral experts to craft policies but also want elections to matter, which has frustrated presidents long before President Trump, but it’s particularly vivid in this polarized age. 
Consequently, the strange structure, tension between neutral competence and electoral responsiveness, and a particularly American resistance to centralized government has formed a conventional wisdom that the federal bureaucracy is way too big and clumsy. 
International comparison
Interestingly, the US public sector is far smaller than other democracies. Federal, state, and local public sector employment in the US is around 25% lower than most European democracies, which matches the level that American government spending is lower than European Union countries’ public expenditures, despite far greater spending on defense in the US. Our taxes as a percentage of our overall economy are 25% to 40% lower than these countries as well.  
Europeans are perfectly comfortable with a larger governing role in society. European Social Democrats and even European Conservative parties dominate elections and both believe that taxing and redistributing wealth bring social equality and stability. Despite our polarized rhetoric, both American parties prefer lower taxes and spending relative to European mainstream parties. 
While American skepticism toward big government is deeply baked into our political culture, that does not mean Americans support dramatic cuts in practice. The Pew Research Center finds that a majority of Americans favor most federal agencies and, except for ICE, Justice, and the IRS, all named agencies have more people favoring them than not. Further, most public policy research indicates that the federal government performs well on efficiency relative to other democracies. And before DOGE, the Government Accountability Office has long closely audited government agencies and publicly reported inefficiencies, waste, and policies that didn’t measure up.   
Whether the DOGE cuts are legal or responsible is being decided by courts and Congress. One ironic, less-discussed problem that may emerge from such sudden cuts is there potential harm for the not-for-profit sectors that Americans prefer tackling social issues like health, human services, education, and the arts. 
Again, a comparative historical look is helpful. Most European countries fully democratized after the socialist movement, which simultaneously pressed for equality and democracy and created the welfare state systems. American democracy began well before the pressures of the industrial revolution and Americans, who had the right to vote across classes even if not gender and race, rejected socialism and large-scale welfare state. So American beliefs of individualism and limited government meant that civil society — churches and not-for-profits — tackled thorny social problems more so and prior to the federal government. 
Leveraging the non-for-profit arena
When the US government did later step into these social issues due the scale of hardship from the depression and social inequalities, its policies leveraged not-for-profit partners rather than directly handling issues with government agency employees. This grant-based approach is a very American approach of strengthening civil society addressing policy problems rather than a government takeover. 
The Urban Institute reports the level of these federal grants. About 27% of health, human services, education and arts-based not-for-profit groups receive federal grants, which is almost identical to the 26% of such Indiana not-for-profits that receive these federal grants. Two-thirds of these groups receive less than 25% of their funds from federal, state, or local grants, so the majority of their funding comes from the private sector.
It’s healthy to debate how much government should be spending, but during the debate it should be considered whether sudden cuts to what is around 25% of not-for-profit budgets could permanently damage groups doing social work. For instance, the network of groups that carries out humanitarian aid around the work that received USAID grants have been devastated by the USAID grant cuts. If major humanitarian issues develop — on top of those existing crushing ones — the private sector groups may be defunct or lack the capacity to address those problems.
Moving forward, it’s vital to consider the balance of public funds to the private sector. There’s consensus among Americans that civil society should be dealing with social issues. Consequently, ensuring that civil society groups thrive must be considered in the pace and level of cuts.

Tim Walz receives the flu and COVID-19 vaccination, Oct. 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the Office of Gov. Walz)Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, received COVID and flu vaccines last week, and the CDC released new guidance that anyone over 6 months can receive the COVID-19 shot after consulting with a pharmacist or health care provider.
“Our message today is simple: Minnesotans will continue to have the freedom to receive their vaccines,” Walz said.
New guidance last week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the COVID shot has cleared up weeks of confusion on who can receive the vaccine, following restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration in August.
The CDC now says that the vaccine can be administered to anyone over 6 months after consultation with a health care provider. The recommendation is a “shared clinical decision-making” guideline — a step down from “routine” recommendations for vaccines — which emphasizes vaccination as an option instead of outright encouraging it, wrote Jason L. Schwartz in a Yale School of Public Health publication.
The Minnesota Department of Health already released a standing order — following an executive order from Walz — to ensure that Minnesotans 3 years old and up can get a COVID shot regardless of federal recommendations.
In other words, Minnesotans’ right to receive the COVID vaccine is protected on both the state and federal level now.


As for whether your insurance will cover the shot, the new CDC guideline is still considered an official recommendation, and most insurance plans’ coverage is linked to CDC recommendations.

AHIP, the trade group representing health insurers, said in a September statement in advance of the CDC recommendation that their member insurance companies would continue covering COVID and flu shots for free until the end of 2026.
MDH said in a statement that that the vaccine will be covered by insurance “in most cases.”
“I would love for our insurance plans to come out and be very clear with their members about the coverage for our COVID vaccines,” MDH Commissioner Brooke Cunningham said. Minnesota does not require state-regulated insurers to cover the COVID vaccine, unlike in 13 states, according to health policy research organization KFF.

Tim Walz receives the flu and COVID-19 vaccination, Oct. 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the Office of Gov. Walz)Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, received COVID and flu vaccines last week, and the CDC released new guidance that anyone over 6 months can receive the COVID-19 shot after consulting with a pharmacist or health care provider.
“Our message today is simple: Minnesotans will continue to have the freedom to receive their vaccines,” Walz said.
New guidance last week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the COVID shot has cleared up weeks of confusion on who can receive the vaccine, following restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration in August.
The CDC now says that the vaccine can be administered to anyone over 6 months after consultation with a health care provider. The recommendation is a “shared clinical decision-making” guideline — a step down from “routine” recommendations for vaccines — which emphasizes vaccination as an option instead of outright encouraging it, wrote Jason L. Schwartz in a Yale School of Public Health publication.
The Minnesota Department of Health already released a standing order — following an executive order from Walz — to ensure that Minnesotans 3 years old and up can get a COVID shot regardless of federal recommendations.
In other words, Minnesotans’ right to receive the COVID vaccine is protected on both the state and federal level now.


As for whether your insurance will cover the shot, the new CDC guideline is still considered an official recommendation, and most insurance plans’ coverage is linked to CDC recommendations. As such, the COVID vaccine will be covered “through all payment mechanisms,” according to a CDC release last week.
AHIP, the trade group representing health insurers, said in a September statement in advance of the CDC recommendation that their member insurance companies would continue covering COVID and flu shots for free until the end of 2026.

This could mean reduced benefits or increased payments by the employers and employees who fund the program, which lets Washingtonians take paid time off work for serious health issues or to care for a family member or a new child. 
The program’s actuary says paid family and medical leave could face a more than $350 million deficit in 2029. 
The state sets a premium rate annually for how much employers and employees need to pay into the program. This year, 0.92% of Washington workers’ paychecks go toward it. Next year, that’s projected to increase to 1.13%, though the rate will be finalized at the end of this month.
The problem is that state law caps premiums for the paid leave program at 1.2%. The state is projected to reach that cap in 2027 and stay there. That plateau means the program likely won’t be able to keep up with rising claims for benefits and increased payments as wages grow.
The program has been steadily growing since its launch in 2020. From July 1, 2024, to June 30, over 320,000 applications were submitted for paid leave, up 15% from the previous year, according to a report this month. Over 240,000 Washingtonians received more than $2 billion in total benefits, a year-over-year increase of about $300 million.
And legislation approved this year extending job protections for those who use this paid leave is likely to encourage even more people to use it.
“This plan is too popular not to be better funded,” said Sen. Steve Conway, D-Tacoma. 
The program already has periodic deficits as it falls behind in paying out claims before receiving premium payments each quarter. But the problem a few years down the road would be a sustained deficit, resulting in not enough money to dole out benefits, without legislators backfilling funding. 
In 2023, faced with a program already more popular than expected, lawmakers infused $200 million from the general fund into the paid leave account. The money provided a cushion and allowed the state to temporarily lower its premium rate.
Another funding boost like this is unlikely anytime soon as the state grapples with deep budget challenges.
Officials are also frustrated about how the rate for premiums has to be set each year under state law. The current formula looks backward, using the past as its main baseline for calculating future needs. Late last year, an audit found this contributed to the program’s potential long-term insolvency.
The Employment Security Department prefers an “actuarial approach” that is more forward-looking. States with similar initiatives take this approach to setting tax rates, and this is akin to how contributions are calculated for Washington’s workers’ compensation system. Last year’s audit recommended shifting to this method. 
A bill in the Legislature looked to make this change this year. Senate Bill 5292, spearheaded by Conway, passed the state Senate nearly unanimously before stalling in the House.
Changing the approach to calculating premiums wouldn’t secure the program’s financial future. The 1.2% cap on premiums would remain.
After Conway’s bill passed the Senate, lawmakers in the state House tried to shoehorn in an increase to the premium rate to 2% by 2033 in an attempt to address the looming deficit. The legislation died in the House, likely due to that change, Conway said. But the measure can be revived in the next legislative session, beginning in January.
Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima, opposes raising the cap on premiums. It’s asking a lot of workers while the state is also now taxing wages to fund Washington’s long-term care program, which started collections in 2023, said King, the top Republican on the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee. He added that this affects lower-income workers more. 
He instead would like to see the conversation focus on cutting back the number of weeks of paid leave people are eligible for, or restricting the events that qualify for eligibility. 
“We got to start looking at, well, just how generous is this program?” King said. “How much of this can we afford to do, and how much are people really willing to pay into a program that a lot of them will never use?”
Another idea floated has been raising what is called the “taxable wage base,” Conway said. Workers only pay taxes to support the program on earnings up to this amount, currently $176,100.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/baby-hand-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 07:56:55.906182

MOScholars, which provides private school vouchers, expanded this fall with an infusion of state funds (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)State funding of private-school vouchers is primarily being used for students attending religious institutions, with nearly 98% of funding going toward Catholic, Christian, Jewish and Islamic schools.
This year, state lawmakers passed a budget that included a request from Gov. Mike Kehoe to supply the state-run K-12 scholarship program, MOScholars, with $50 million of general revenue. Previously, the impact to the state’s bottom line was indirect, with 100% tax-deductible donations fueling the program.
Donations are still part of MOScholars’ funding, but the state appropriation has more than doubled the number of scholarships available.
During the 2024-25 school year, MOScholars awarded $15.2 million in scholarships.
In August alone, the State Treasurer’s Office received invoices for scholarships totaling $15.6 million, according to documents obtained by The Independent under Missouri’s open records laws.
The invoice process is unique to the direct state funding of the program. The nonprofits that administer scholarships, called educational assistance organizations, were the sole keepers of scholarship funds. But now, the State Treasurer’s Office holds scholarship money derived from general revenue in an account previously only used for program marketing and administration.
The invoices contained data on which schools MOScholars students are attending and the scholarship amount.
Of the 2,329 scholarships awarded in August, only 59 went to students in nonreligious schools.
 

 
This number did not surprise Democratic lawmakers, who for years have warned that state revenue was going to be siphoned into religious schools.
“We are simply subsidizing, with tax dollars, parents who would already choose to send their kids to a private school,” state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat, told The Independent. “And now we are using public dollars to pay for schools that are not transparent whatsoever in choosing who to educate and who not.”
Some schools have been criticized for admission requirements that push a moral standard.
Christian Fellowship School in Columbia, which received scholarships for 63 MOScholars students in August, requires “at least one parent of enrolled students professes faith in Christ and agrees with the admission policies and the philosophy and doctrinal statements of the school,” according to its handbook. 
These statements include disapproval of homosexuality.
“The school reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission of an applicant or to discontinue enrollment of a student,” the handbook continues.
With around 430 K-12 students enrolled at Christian Fellowship School, according to National Center for Educational Statistics survey data, MOScholars makes up a sizable portion of its funding. But it is not the only school with a large number of scholarship recipients.
Torah Prep School in St. Louis had 229 K-12 students during the 2023-24 school year. And in August, 197 MOScholars students received funding to attend the school. Torah Prep did not respond to a request for comment.
The high number of students attending religious schools with MOScholars funding is somewhat incidental, somewhat by design.
The MOScholars program allows its six educational assistance organizations to choose what scholarships they are willing to support. 
Religious organizations stepped into the role to help connect congregants with affiliated schools. Only two of the six educational assistance organizations partner with schools unaffiliated with religion.
The Catholic dioceses of Kansas City-St. Joseph and Springfield-Cape Girardeau run the educational assistance organization Bright Futures Fund, which administered nearly half of the scholarships awarded in August.
The educational assistance organization Agudath Israel of Missouri focuses on Jewish education, partnering with four Jewish day schools.
The organization’s director Hillel Anton told The Independent that students are attracted to the program for more than just religious reasons.
“(Parents’) first and foremost concern is where their child is going to be able to be in the best learning environment,” Anton said. “And you may have a faith-based school that is fantastic and is able to provide that.”
 

 
The demand for the program has long exceeded funding availability. Going into August, organizations had waitlists of students eligible for a scholarship but without funding secured.
Agudath Israel of Missouri couldn’t guarantee scholarships for all of the returning students, Anton said, until the state funding was official.
“Because a lot of the funding is done towards the end of the year… we had everyone on a wait list,” he said. “Because we didn’t know necessarily how much funding we were going to have, we weren’t awarding anyone (the funding).”
Because the program was previously powered by 100% tax-deductible donations, the majority of funds poured in around December. But families need the money months sooner, with tuition due at the start of the school year.
Some educational assistance organizations prefunded scholarships, dipping into their savings to front expenses in the fall. Others had schools that would accept students and wait for payment.
The funding from the state, though, has resolved the backlog and allowed organizations to give scholarships to everyone on their wait list.
“Everyone who qualified for a scholarship this year received one,” Ashlie Hand, Bright Futures Fund’s director of communications, told The Independent.
Bright Futures Fund nearly doubled the number of students it serves, from 1,050 to 1,909.
Agudath Israel of Missouri is growing, too. The new funding helped the organization expand from 175 scholarships last year to 277 this year.
Some expect the state funding to continue next year to support this year’s windfall of scholarships. State Treasurer Vivek Malek told The Independent in May that if donations fall short, he will request state funds to support the new students through graduation.

As we near the holiday season, you may be looking to treat yourself to those set of wheels you’ve been eyeing, or perhaps it’s time to purchase your loved one their dream car. In today’s financial climate, managing your vehicle costs efficiently is key, as it could help you save money and limit potential headaches down the road. Here are some helpful tips to finally make that purchase for your (or a loved one’s) dream vehicle this holiday season:

Set your holiday budget, and stick to it. There are a variety of different expenses that come with getting a car – the purchase cost, insurance, maintenance and fuel being a few of them. Knowing how much you can afford, especially if you plan to pay for it over time, is key to avoiding a car bill that stretches your finances. Look for access to different budgeting tools and tips that can help you save for your purchase.
Look for the best holiday deals. Like many other items, vehicles have a price cycle; the end of the year tends to be when you can find a better deal, as dealers may need to meet quotas or clear out inventory. Generally, make sure you are considering multiple vehicles and shopping around at several dealerships to get the best price. 
Test drive the vehicle to make sure it fits your needs. This is your time to see how the vehicle looks and feels, try out the interior systems and figure out if the vehicle fits your needs. Schedule test drive appointments to ensure the car you want is still available, ideally a few in the same day or week to keep your impressions fresh in your mind. It’s also helpful to simulate your daily driving conditions as much as possible, such as bringing any car seats or equipment you may have in your car daily. After your test drive, you can ask about the car’s warranty and fuel and maintenance requirements, as well as the possibility of getting an extended test drive or bringing the car to your own mechanic for a second opinion.
Determine whether you are financing or leasing. There are benefits of both a lease and a loan. With a loan, there is no milage limit and you are free to customize and change the car as you see fit. After completing your finance payments, you own it. Leases typically have lower upfront costs than loan payments, and at the end of the term you can return, purchase or trade the vehicle in. But keep in mind that most leases have a mileage limit, so it might not be the best option if you travel often.  
How to know if an electric vehicle is right for you. With so many major manufacturers building EVs, there are more options than ever before. However, cost, maintenance, range and charging logistics are all key factors to consider. For maintenance, EVs typically require less maintenance than traditional cars. EV batteries tend to be covered by 8-10 year warranties (outlasting the amount of time most people own their cars) but EV tires degrade faster due to the weight of the battery.  And just as gas prices vary, so do electricity costs – based on your location, your driving style and the size of your battery.

The median range of an EV with a fully charged battery is roughly 250 miles, but that number depends on the make and model as well as other factors like weather, traffic conditions and driving style. And when it comes to charging infrastructure, some cities and states may have more charging stations than others. Make sure to plan your trip ahead of time and map your route.  
Be sure to do your homework first before making that big purchase. There are many tools available that can help you plan for costs in addition to the vehicle loan or lease payments, such as sales taxes, registration fees, and insurance—which can vary depending on the car make, model and even the color. For instance, using a car payment calculator can help estimate your monthly car payment for different scenarios, by inputting the ballpark amount you’d like to finance along with some other basic info.

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).No, I do not want to go collect signatures. 
My friend asks. I rack my brain for excuses. Walking up to strangers does not come naturally to me. My kids must have a soccer game or birthday party or something that conflicts. 
They do not. I have no excuse. I go. 
Once I get out there, I‘m glad I did. I meet lots of people just as angry as I am about the gerrymander of Kansas City and eager to reverse it. People thank me for being there.
I remain extremely resentful that I need to do it. 
I’m collecting signatures to reverse the bill passed in the special session that redraws Missouri’s new maps to deprive Kansas City residents of their voting power, specifically, of their U.S. Representative of 20 years, Emanuel Cleaver.
If our legislators would embrace democracy, play by the rules and represent their constituents, I’d be hanging with my family instead of approaching strangers on the sidewalk with a clipboard.
Trump demanded that red states redistrict mid-decade to increase Republican chances of retaining control of the House. Trump constantly says how popular he is, but if he believed that, he wouldn’t need new maps.
Some Republican governors pushed back against Trump’s demands. 
Not ours. 
Gov. Mike Kehoe took his MAGA marching orders and called the legislature into a special session even though our legislature fought over and redrew our maps only two years ago. Kehoe did this even though Missouri is already extremely gerrymandered, with 40% of Missouri voters identifying as Democrats, but only two out of eight congressional seats represented by Democrats. The gerrymander is intended to make that one out of eight. 
They also passed a bill in the special session to make it impossible for Missourians to use the initiative petition process. 
It is astoundingly anti-democratic that the majority of Missouri legislators have dedicated themselves to thwarting the will of Missouri voters and getting around the Missouri constitution.
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

Sure, I’m grateful Missouri has the citizens’ initiative petition so that voters can enact policies with bipartisan support when the legislature refuses to. Yes, I’m grateful for the referendum process that allows voters to reject laws passed by the legislature. 
But it’s a bad way to make law.
We wouldn’t need to use these burdensome, expensive processes if Missouri legislators didn’t treat Missouri voters like an enemy to be defeated.
It’s absurd that we have 40 pages of marijuana regulations in our state constitution. The legislature should have decriminalized marijuana via statute, enacting a policy favored by a majority of Missourians, but leaving legislators with flexibility to amend it as needed. Instead, advocates for policy changes increasingly feel they have to do everything by constitutional amendment because our legislature will immediately overturn any statute enacted by voters.
The paid sick leave ballot initiative, approved by 57% of Missouri voters after advocates gathered thousands of signatures to get it on the ballot, was only a statute. So the legislature trashed that, no problem. 
Even a constitutional amendment isn’t enough. As soon as Missourians decriminalized abortion via Amendment 3, the legislature immediately sought to reverse it. They halted all the legislature’s business at the end of session to put a deliberately misleading measure to re-ban abortion on the 2026 ballot (The amendment to re-ban abortion will also be called Amendment 3, for ultimate voter confusion).
This is not how democracy is supposed to work. Our representatives should represent us. All of us. Even those of us who are Democrats or independents or Republicans who support abortion decriminalization or paid sick leave. Voters are supposed to pick their representatives rather than politicians picking their voters. 
But Missouri Republicans are all in on Trump’s goal of dominating the opposition by whatever means necessary — including unconstitutional means. They are rejecting the fundamental premise of our democratic system that representatives of different populations must negotiate what the laws should be that govern all of us.
I saw Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin on a panel last year. She favorably contrasted the work that women in the legislature were able to do across the aisle to the extremism of some of her fellow Republicans. 
O’Laughlin has since gone all in for extremism. She abandoned any interest she once claimed to have in working for all Missourians when she shepherded the special session bills to deprive Kansas City area Missourians of their representation and gut all Missourians’ constitutional right to the initiative petition.
O’Laughlin, who presides over a Republican supermajority, made a claim about her other colleagues in an attempt to defend the gerrymander that is both laughable and shockingly disingenuous: “The map and the initiative petition reform measures will strike a huge blow to progressives and their efforts to turn Missouri into California.” 
Again, Missouri voters are 40% Democrats, with 25% representation in Congress. O’Laughlin’s allegation that anyone is trying to turn Missouri into California puts her at the goofiness level of the Missouri Freedom Caucus members she once criticized. But somehow she now has no problem lying about her colleagues across the aisle in defense of an unconstitutional bill intended to get Democratic representation down to 12.5%. On Trump’s orders. 
Gov. Kehoe readily abandoned his constitutional obligations when Trump said jump. The Missouri constitution says that redistricting happens every 10 years, after the federal census. Kehoe says, “We’ll let the courts decide that.”
Here’s the thing: Running a state is not supposed to be a game of “what can I get away with?” 
Kehoe swore an oath to uphold the constitution of Missouri. He shouldn’t be signing a mid-decade map openly designed to disenfranchise targeted Missourians. The job of the governor is to work in the interest of Missourians, not to light Missouri tax dollars afire with a special session and the inevitable lawsuits that will follow, to demonstrate fealty to Donald Trump.
The gerrymander is unconstitutional and I don’t expect it can survive court review. However, because I believe there are few things in life more important than living in a functioning democracy, I won’t be taking any chances.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


More than $130 million in Wisconsin clean energy-related projects are at risk as the Trump administration moves to cut up to $24 billion in projects originally approved by the Biden administration.
The projects are on a list that covers three groups of cuts proposed in May, on Oct. 2 and this past week. The online news outlet Semafor reported the third set of proposed cuts, which alone totals $12 billion, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, and published a link to a list that covers all three groups.
“However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the [federal government] shutdown,” Semafor reported.
The Wisconsin grants on the list are a mix of projects that help boost energy efficiency, including supporting the expansion of energy storage battery systems. One potential casualty is more than $1 million to prepare young people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades.
Clean energy holds the promise of addressing air pollution and climate change as well as revitalizing the state’s industrial base, said John Imes, director of the Wisconsin Environmental Initiative (WEI), a nonprofit that advocates policies benefiting the environment and the economy.
“These are all win-win that all of us want regardless of our political affiliation,” Imes told the Wisconsin Examiner. “This is all bottom-line stuff.”
Rolling back projects that enhance cleaner and more efficient use of energy will likely increase the cost of energy, Imes said.
“It means higher electric bills, higher energy bills, fewer choices and lost jobs,” he said. “We’re going to lose momentum.”
Battery power and rural grid upgrade
The two largest Wisconsin projects on the Department of Energy list of targets involve one company, Alliant Energy. They account for more than half of the Wisconsin funds targeted for cancellation.
The projects are being undertaken by Alliant’s Wisconsin Power & Light unit. They include a $50 million grant for upgrading the rural electrical grid and $30 million for a power storage system using a technology based on carbon dioxide this is to be built near Portage, Wisconsin.

“We understand the Administration and Department of Energy (DOE) are working through their budgets and have notified some businesses of changes to grant announcements,” said Cindy Tomlinson, Alliant senior manager for communications, in an email message last week.
“At this time, we have not been made aware of any changes to the announced DOE grants for our Alliant Energy projects,” Tomlinson said. “We are optimistic the value and viability of these projects is clear and that they will remain fully funded. These projects deliver economic and customer benefits.”
The electrical grid upgrade project received a conditional commitment from the energy department in December, but a final award agreement hasn’t been executed, Tomlinson said, and no federal funds have been received or spent.
The federal grants accounted for about one-third of the total planned investment for each project. If the grid upgrade grant is canceled, the project is still expected to go forward, Tomlinson said, “however at a slower, more gradual pace than the fast, concentrated fashion outlined in our grant application.”
Other potentially affected grants include $28.7 million for Johnson Controls, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, to support the company in its expansion of heat pump manufacturing.
The grant’s total value was $33 million at the time it was awarded to the company. According to USAspending.gov, a federal site that tracks the status of federal outlays, the business has received $4.4 million of the total.
Johnson Controls announced the grant in November 2023, part of an investment to scale up heat pump manufacturing at plants in Texas, Kansas and Pennsylvania and increase production by 200%, the company said at the time.
The company did not respond to inquiries Thursday and Friday by email and by telephone about the status of the grant or its planned heat pump manufacturing expansion.
Energy efficiency and innovation
Another Wisconsin recipient with grants on the list that are slated for elimination is Slipstream, a Madison-based nonprofit that provides consulting services on energy efficiency and innovation.
“We’re trying to make our energy systems more efficient and better so everybody’s paying less for energy,” said Scott Hackel, Slipstream’s vice president for research.
Hackel said Slipstream is working with other organizations on the list of targeted projects, and some of those organizations have been notified of grant terminations.
Slipstream also has two direct grants on the list, but has not received any notification that those grants are being terminated, Hackel said.
Slipstream had been awarded $5.2 million for work on equipping buildings with technology that enables them to automatically manage their power demand — reducing the building’s electrical load when demand on the grid is high and amping up the load when broader demand eases.
The organization is in the middle of a project implementing demand management technology in a group of buildings. The information gained from that test could be used to develop incentive programs for building owners to adopt that kind of technology, Hackel said.
If that gets cut off before it’s finished, other buildings in Wisconsin “would not have this example to look to,” he said.
A second grant awarded to the organization, $4 million, is to be used to train inspectors, building designers and others in how to effectively comply with and make the best use of building codes, particularly energy codes.
“Everything we’re doing is trying to make buildings and homes more affordable to live in with lower utility bills,” Hackel said. “If we’re not able to do that, that’s also a cost to people in Wisconsin.”
Two Universities of Wisconsin grants, one for $10 million and the other for $2.9 million, are on the list. Both involve projects to test technology innovations, according to the federal grant information documents.  
‘Electric city’ upgrades and a job-training program
A grant for the city of Kaukauna, Wisconsin, to install battery storage and make related electrical grid upgrades is also on the list. The original grant totaled $3 million, and so far $59,362 has been paid out, according to USAspending.gov, leaving $2.95 million that could be canceled.

The storage system is to bolster Kaukauna’s hydroelectric power generation operation, which dates to 1913 and led to the community’s adoption of “Electric City” as its nickname.
“Collateral damage from the Trump administration’s remarkably poor governance record continues to collect, this time in Kaukauna,” said Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson. “I can’t think of something more insulting than making the electric grid of a place known as ‘Electric City’ less safe or efficient.”
Also on the list is the Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a Milwaukee nonprofit that provides training and certification to prepare people to enter apprenticeships in the skilled trades. WRTP was awarded a $1.5 million grant for training in skills related to transportation electrification. So far $112,470 has been paid out. 
Dan Bukiewicz, head of the Milwaukee Building Trades Council and co-chair of the WRTP board of directors, said that the board hasn’t been notified that its grant might be at risk of being taken away by the Trump administration.
“I won’t say we’re surprised,” however, Bukiewicz said. “They’re just trying to roll back a lot of the green energy and infrastructure [investments]. … It’s trying to make time stand still, and it just won’t if the United States is going to compete globally.”
WRTP students typically come from underserved communities and are the most in need, Bukiewicz said. The program’s training emphasizes job safety, introduces students to the construction industry, equips them with basic skills that an apprenticeship will build on, and acquaints them with how the industry and the technology are changing and where they might find a place that suits them.
If the federal grant is pulled, “these dollars are irreplaceable,” Bukiewicz said. “It’s not just taking money away and eliminating classes. It’s eliminating opportunities and a chance for generational change for people who really need it.”

The superintendent of Moore Public Schools didn’t think the Oklahoma Legislature made the right choice when implementing a statewide ban on student cellphones in schools this year. He thought parents would be against it and teachers would spend too much time policing the rule.
“I’m all about eating crow when I have to, and they got this one right,” he said.
Now nine weeks into the school year, Romines said “things have gone really, really well.” Discipline incidents have significantly decreased, he said, and students are more engaged with their teachers and each other.  
Students are passing footballs and playing volleyball in high school courtyards during lunch period. Junior high students are playing cards and board games.
“Those are things that we would not have seen last year and in previous years,” he said. “That’s big. I mean, that’s huge. It’s just been a really good thing.”

Senate Bill 139 prohibited student use of personal electronic devices, including cellphones and smart watches, for the entire school day. The law required all public school districts to comply with the full-day ban for the 2025-26 school year. After that, each local school board can decide whether to continue with the policy or try something different.
Romines said he expects Moore to keep the policy next year, though the decision isn’t his to make alone. 
He said it’s been helpful that all public schools in the state are under the same cellphone rule, so “parents can’t come back and say, ‘Well, Norman does it this way. Moore does it this way. Mustang does it this way, Edmond does it this way.’” The lack of comparison has helped with acceptance.
In Bartlesville Public Schools, cellphones had become an incessant nuisance in seventh-grade teacher Heather Davis’ classroom. 
Davis, in her 32nd year of teaching, remembers when old Nokia cellphones first appeared in her students’ hands, but once personal devices started connecting to social media, “that’s when I saw the uptick in kids checking out of school and checking into their cellphones.”
“It was constant lunch detentions, calls home, sent to the office, all of that,” she said. “And I would say that probably it was a problem for about 30% to 40% of my students.”

That changed dramatically this year with the statewide ban in place. So far, Davis said she’s had to discipline only one student for breaking the rule.
Her school had attempted to crack down on cellphones in the past, but this time, students and their parents have been more willing to comply, knowing the policy comes from a state law, she said.
It’s made a noticeable difference in her English language arts classes, she said. More students are participating, asking questions and completing their work.
“My kids are way more engaged,” Davis said. “I have a lot more students who are passing at this point in the class in the school year.”
Another seventh-grade teacher, Melanie Darter, said the cellphone ban has been a “game changer” at John W. Rex Charter Intermediate School in Oklahoma City. 
Students at the school are required to leave their cellphones in their backpacks for the day, said Darter, who teaches science.

“I haven’t seen one yet,” Darter said while speaking at an interim study Tuesday at the state Capitol. “Every once in a while, one will ring in my class, but it’s because it’s in their backpack. And so, I’m like, hey, I don’t even care. It’s away. So, they’re doing really well with that.”
An author of SB 139, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, said she hears from educators and parents multiple times a week about the impact of the cellphone ban — stories of extra books being checked out in school libraries and anecdotes of classmates showing more togetherness.
Given the perceived success of the cellphone ban, Seifried and the law’s House author, Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, are now exploring whether other technology, like Chromebooks, should be limited in schools. They didn’t draw a definitive conclusion during their interim study on the topic Tuesday, but both said they want to continue the conversation. 
In the meantime, Caldwell said feedback has been “really, really positive” with SB 139 in effect.
“Just the stories we’ve heard from our educators about the laughter and the conversation that is filling our hallways and our lunchrooms, I think that’s exciting,” he said. “And you take a look at increased learning opportunities and a decrease in behavioral issues, I mean, that is a true win-win. I think it’s a very simple change, but it’s one that’s really having a profound impact on our kids.”

 Idaho wants to exempt some services for personal agencies, family homes from Medicaid pay cuts

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider reimbursement rates in late August. The move was in response to Gov. Brad Little’s order for mid-year budget cuts across state government to avoid a budget shortfall.
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

The Medicaid pay cuts are already in effect, sort of.
The state is paying providers the usual reimbursement rates. But once Idaho gets permission from the federal government, the state can claw back funds for the cuts.
Health and Welfare spokesperson Greg Stahl told the Idaho Capital Sun last week that the agency is asking the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to let the state exempt services for personal care and certified family homes from the cuts. 
“The requests held harmless personal care services and certified family homes from rate adjustments following the required access analysis and public comment,” Stahl said in an email. “The department will post an information release for providers in the coming weeks with more details.”
 Idaho can’t afford to lose more providers, advocate says

Idaho Association of HomeCare Agency President Lindsey Hendricks said exempting disability care providers from the cuts doesn’t solve their financial issues.
“We’re still so far behind on where we should be with reimbursement rates,” she told the Sun. 
If payments stay on track, about a quarter of Idaho personal care agencies are at risk of closing within the next year, according to a survey by the organization. And if the state’s cuts to Medicaid payments extend to disability care providers, even more agencies anticipate they’d be forced to make tough decisions, like closing their doors, cutting staff pay or services.

In 2023, a report by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations estimated Idaho had a shortfall of 3,000 direct care workers. But by 2023, the report projected the shortfall would more than triple — to 9,500 workers. 
Idaho can’t afford to lose any more providers, said Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities Executive Director Christine Pisani. 
“We are well on our way of having a complete void of service providers as a result of not addressing the direct care workforce crisis in Home and Community-Based Services,” she told the Sun. “So, who’s really going to get hit hard are our seniors, people with disabilities and families. And our rural areas have already been left behind. … So anything they do have, I think is going to be lost.” 
Most of the home care providers in the Idaho Health Care Association already don’t take Medicaid — because the program’s reimbursement rate hasn’t kept up with costs, said the group’s Executive Director Robert Vande Merwe.
Exempting them from the cuts, he said, “keeps them at status quo, which is still not enough.”
“We’re urging the Legislature not to cut taxes again, unless they have a plan to stabilize the budget,” Vande Merwe said. 
He thinks the governor may need to cut spending more “just to stay whole from the last year’s tax cuts,” he said. “If they cut taxes again this session, boy, there’s going to be dramatic cuts in services.”

Several relief programs are now available to certain homeowners. Some require an application.
The post What to know about applying for Wyoming’s property tax exemptions appeared first on WyoFile .","The application window is now open for several property tax relief programs in Wyoming, including exemptions for veterans, long-term homeowners and owner-occupied residential properties. 
WyoFile spoke with Dixie Huxtable, Converse County clerk and legislative committee chairperson for the Wyoming County Assessors’ Association, about what homeowners need to know to save on their tax bills. 
Property taxes have been a major focus of the Wyoming Legislature in recent years, and county officials have done everything from mailings and media advertisements to town halls and visits to the local senior citizen center. 
Still, Huxtable said, some homeowners are not aware of what’s available to them. 
“I’d like to think that we’ve done as much as we can to reach everybody but I still get people — I’ve had people since the first of October, come to my counter and say, ‘I’ve never heard of this before. I didn’t know anything about this until my neighbor told me,’” Huxtable said. 
The one cost-savings program in state law that does not require homeowners to fill out an application is a 4% cap on year-to-year property tax increases. 
Technically, Huxtable said, there are two 4% caps — one is applied to the residential structure, another to the associated residential land. But neither require any action on the homeowner’s part. From there, assessors consider exemptions in an order set by state law. 
Exemptions
Homeowners who live in their home for at least eight months of the year are eligible for a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of the property’s fair market value. 
Last tax year, the exemption was automatically applied to all single-family homes in Wyoming. Homeowners must now apply online by Feb. 1, which includes signing an affidavit affirming they occupy the property. Because an estimated 175,000 homeowners will qualify for the program, Huxtable said the assessors worked with the Department of Revenue to develop the website. 
“We tried to come up with an efficient way to do it, and I’m sure it’s going to have some hiccups. It has had some hiccups, but we’re trying to work it out as best we can to meet the law,” Huxtable said. 
She also said she understands the online process may be difficult for some to access on their own. 
“I have parents that are 95 and 89 years old, and they live at home and they pay their own bills. But they don’t understand this. They don’t have a computer,” Huxtable said.
Wyoming’s older homeowners have another tax-saving option with an exemption specifically for residents 65 years of age and older. Those residents — who have also paid property taxes in the state for at least 25 years — may qualify for a 50% exemption. The home must also be their primary residence. 
Homeowners may apply at their local county assessor’s office before May 26. However, homeowners may not receive both the 25% and the 50% exemptions. 
“It’s not cumulative. It’s one or the other,” Huxtable said. 
Lastly, there is an exemption available for veterans. It reduces the assessed valuation by $6,000, and can also be applied to a vehicle. Applications are available at the local county assessor’s office and are due May 26. 
While not an exemption, the state’s property tax refund program may be another option for homeowners. Whether the program is available will depend on whether lawmakers chose to fund it in the upcoming session. Some legislators are interested in taking things in a different direction, including abolishing property taxes altogether. 
Meanwhile, some homeowners have urged the Legislature to skip further property tax cuts, citing concerns about funding for public services. Property taxes don’t fund the state government, but rather pay for local services including schools, law enforcement, roads, water and sewer systems, parks and libraries. 
In her own community, Huxtable said she’s noticed people becoming more aware of what property taxes pay for. 
“As this progresses, I think people are beginning to understand that it’s going to have an effect on the services that they’ve come to expect,” Huxtable said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Earlier this month, Oklahoma’s state Insurance Department issued a stark warning that should alarm us all.
When federally enhanced tax credits expire at the end of the year, some Oklahomans will see their health insurance premiums increase by over 75%. The state agency additionally warned that the termination of the federal program and stricter eligibility verification checks will likely “result in a significant decrease in enrollment.”
Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready, a Republican, has urged Congress “to take a softer approach to ending” the subsidies and warned that “the impact to Oklahoma hospital systems is yet to be realized.”
That’s because nearly 300,000 Oklahomans rely on the federal marketplace for health insurance. The tax credits, which end unless Congress takes action, provide financial assistance to help Americans afford health insurance through the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. The marketplace serves as a safety net for people who don’t have employer-sponsored plans or don’t qualify for public programs like Medicaid or Medicare.
Slightly over 10% of the nearly 4 million Oklahomans are already uninsured, higher than the national average of 8%.
Instead of taking Mulready’s suggestion for a “softer approach,” we’re getting the nuclear option of a federal government shutdown.
Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s Republican congressional representatives won’t publicly even consider a pitch by Democrats to permanently restore those federal health subsidies. 
It makes them seem completely tone-deaf to the plight our state is facing even as they heroically fight for their party’s honor.
To be clear, I blame every elected official in D.C. for the shutdown that began Oct. 1. And, I think Democrats are foolhardy to try to use a shutdown like this to leverage this policy goal even if it is needed.
But I don’t understand why both sides can’t temporarily compromise on Republicans’ plan for a short-term extension that keeps the government open until Nov. 21 to give the GOP time to work out the logistics of continuing this vital program. I also don’t understand why Republicans won’t commit to extending this in exchange for ending this shutdown.
This inability to even consider compromise is making me wonder what we’re paying Congress for when they can’t even do their most basic job — pass a budget that lasts an entire fiscal year.
After all, they’re supposed to represent our needs in D.C. That should mean Oklahomans’ needs trump their political party’s. (No pun intended.)
And right now, 300,000 Oklahomans — and frankly our state’s entire health care system — need extended access to those affordable insurance premiums that Democrats are fighting for. (Americans covered by private employers also need access to affordable premiums, but that’s a whole other issue.)
I understand the reluctance to give Republicans more time, but the stakes are too high here to mess this up.
Still I figured our congressional delegations would be spending their days trying to broker a bipartisan compromise to make sure our state’s federal workers get paid.
Republican Sen. James Lankford, after all, showed an inspiring level of bipartisanship in 2024 when he worked across party lines to help develop a plan to help fix our immigration system. But his party rejected the proposal and hung him out to dry after then-presidential candidate Donald Trump pooh-poohed it, so I can understand his reluctance to stick his neck out here. 
Maybe Lankford should be trying to keep a low profile, though. He apparently had so much time on his hands last week that he was making the rounds on seemingly any television show that would have him. He blamed Democrats trying to appeal to their “far-left base” even as service members risk missing paychecks because of the shutdown.
And then he was even so bold to post this gem on social media about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer: “Sen. Schumer believes this shutdown is a success for the Democrats politically. You’ve got to be kidding me – members of our military are serving our country while not getting paid.”
You know who is getting paid? Lankford and Schumer. 
Congress gets paid even if they’re not working because they’re protected by the U.S. Constitution during government shutdowns even while members of our military, air traffic controllers and hundreds of thousands of American employees go without.
Not to be left out, Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice, asked Schumer on her social media account if he would “like to explain how missing a paycheck makes things better for hard-working Oklahomans?”
I’d be very curious to know how losing federal health insurance subsidies make things better for hard-working Oklahomans, too.
Americans are not paying our delegation to sit on their behinds and play the blame game on TV and social media.
It’s time for them to remember who they represent and take this my-way-or-the-highway mentality and shove it where it belongs. They should serve the voters, not their political parties.

The grant would support BWXT's proposed TRISO plant, while another $10 million would support carbon capture and a potential new coal-fueled power unit, all in Campbell County. 
The post Wyoming considers $100M bet on nuclear fuel manufacturing appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s top energy agency is recommending a $100 million grant to support long-time U.S. Navy contractor BWXT Technologies’ TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in Gillette, as well as nearly $10 million in grants to continue carbon capture research and a potential new coal-fueled power unit, all in Campbell County.
Another potential grant award for $343,000 would support a feasibility study to expand a carbon dioxide pipeline network to boost enhanced oil recovery.
The Wyoming Energy Authority announced the potential grant awards this week and will accept public comment before Gov. Mark Gordon makes a final determination about whether to approve each one. The grant programs are directed at energy projects in Wyoming that “are also receiving federal or private funding,” according to the agency.
“Like other [Energy Matching Funds] projects, these projects represent a turning point for Wyoming’s energy future,” Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told WyoFile via email. “Their scale speaks to the seriousness with which our state approaches energy development and diversification, not as a short-term effort, but as a long-term strategy to keep Wyoming strong and energy dominant.” 
Nuclear fuel manufacturing
BWXT proposes to build a $500 million TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. Construction of the “Category II” plant would begin about a year from now, with an in-service target of 2030, according to the Lynchburg, Virginia-based company.

TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of a poppyseed, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. TRISO can withstand higher temperatures than traditional nuclear fuels, and the fuel never leaves the encased pellet, according to the agency.
Importantly, BWXT officials noted, “The facility [in Wyoming] will not produce or store any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel and will not be licensed to do so by the [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission],” the company said in its application to the state.
Separately, BWXT received a $10 million grant from the state in 2023 to study how to tap Wyoming’s existing and potential machining, fabrication and manufacturing facilities to build a supply chain for microreactors. The company inked a tentative agreement last year with trona miner and soda ash producer TATA Chemicals for microreactors to be installed at its facility in southwest Wyoming.
Joshua Parker, BWXT’s senior director of Advanced Nuclear Fuel, recently spoke at a company-sponsored event in Gillette to explain why nuclear energy is receiving renewed interest and to update residents on the company’s dealings in Wyoming.

“We are an energy-starved country,” Parker told a crowd of about 200, adding that the need to support the electricity-hungry artificial intelligence boom is a matter of national security. “Here’s the thing: It takes every energy source. It’s not nuclear, it’s everything. It’s all. We need [natural gas], we need coal … We’re about to have growth in energy that we haven’t seen since coming out of World War II.
“Wyoming,” he continued, “you all have the workforce. You all have the manufacturing. You all have the energy drive. You have uranium here. You have all of those things that make a good energy community.”
BWXT’s pending $100 million grant would be the first and sole recipient of Wyoming’s Large Project Energy Matching Fund, created in 2024. If approved, the grant would fully tap the fund’s $100 million appropriation.
The Energy Authority kicked off a 45-day public comment period regarding the grant recommendation, closing on Nov. 25. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.
Coal and carbon dioxide grants
The Wyoming Energy Authority is also considering recommending nearly $10 million from another grant program — Energy Matching Funds — to help support three other energy projects in the state.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative is asking for $4 million for an engineering and feasibility study to analyze whether to build a second coal-fueled unit at its Dry Fork Station power plant north of Gillette. The “Dry Fork Station Unit 2” study, a partnership between Basin Electric and engineering firm Sargent and Lundy, includes evaluating “boiler technologies, air quality control systems and air quality compliance,” according to an application submitted to the agency.

“Moreover, the study will provide a comprehensive comparison of coal generation alongside alternative energy sources, allowing Basin Electric to align its resource planning with current energy market trends and regulatory standards,” the company said.
The 400-plus megawatt-capacity Dry Fork Station was completed in 2011 and gets its coal from the associated Dry Fork mine. It was designed to incorporate carbon capture research.
“Recently many states have talked about their aspirations of building a new coal plant, Wyoming included,” the Energy Authority’s Creager said. “This is the first of many steps towards building America’s next coal plant in Wyoming that will use millions of tons of Powder River Basin coal annually.”
A second Energy Matching Funds grant for $5.5 million would go to the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources to advance its work tied to coal-carbon capture technology at the Integrated Test Center, which is mostly housed at the same Dry Fork Station complex.
“The project aims to expand the [Integrated Test Center’s] capabilities by accommodating a wider range of carbon management technologies,” according to the application. “The facility upgrades and operating plan will help ensure continued [Test Center] operations beyond 2026, attract diverse research tenants and strengthen Gillette’s role as a national hub for carbon management innovation and workforce development.”
The Energy Matching Funds considerations also include Contango’s application for $343,000 to expand a carbon dioxide pipeline network in the Big Horn Basin in support of enhanced oil recovery. 
All three proposals are open for public comment, closing on Oct. 18. Public comments can be sent to wea@wyo.gov.

As the pile grows in the sink and grows mold, doing the dishes becomes a more overwhelming task, but having help can make it easier, writes Ben Anderson.
The post Politics is like dirty dishes appeared first on WyoFile .","No one ever wants to hand-wash the dishes. It’s boring, gross, time-consuming and thankless. It’s even worse when the dishes haven’t been done in weeks. The growing mold, the stack towering ever taller, the mental drain of fighting over who’s fault it is or even just beating yourself up for letting it get this bad. We get overwhelmed, hoping someone else does them. 

Opinion

Politics and the government are that stack of dishes, except instead of piling up for weeks, it’s been decades. The mold and toxicity have reached life-threatening levels. It’s past time for us to do the dishes!
If the government is dishes, life is the food we eat off them. The purpose of dishes is to make it easier and safer to eat. Hot soup is much easier to eat with a bowl and spoon instead of your hands. Government is supposed to play a similar role, making many aspects of life easier for everyone. The government should help meet everyone’s needs and resolve conflicts, just as bowls and spoons make dishing out soup in equal amounts easier.
Everyone eats from the political plates, whether they think so or not. Everyone drinks water, and its acceptable cleanliness levels are determined by the government. Everyone breathes air, and ideally, regulations say corporations can’t expose us to deadly levels of toxins. Everyone also needs health care, yet those who are the least lucky and need help the most end up with unpayable amounts of debt. Either eat your health care soup out of this moldy bowl of insurance, or burn your hand reaching into the pot. 
We argue and bicker about whose turn it is to do the dishes, but someone inevitably points out that we can order pizza and not do the dishes. That benefits the pizza shop, but it’s not a long-term solution.
What does doing the dishes look like? It’s hard work, and commonly boring. It’s going to the city council meeting and talking to your friends about it. It’s getting on the live stream for the Wyoming Legislature’s subcommittees and telling them what you think. It’s voting in primaries. It’s being a political candidate. It’s staying informed and supporting your local, independent news sources. It’s convincing others to help.
This is all too much for one person to do. But just like hand-washing dishes, you don’t actually do it alone. You benefit from the work put into manufacturing the sponges, the research on what makes a good dish soap and the marketing, so you know those products even exist. Those tools are community organizing. It’s way easier if we work together. Just like society, the whole is greater than the parts.
I ask all of you reading to help do the dishes. I don’t want anyone else to die from the bacteria, and the only way to ensure that is to get in there and start scrubbing. The pile may not be our fault, but it is our responsibility. If we all agree to take on one dish, we can get them clean again.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) A mother with a 4-week-old baby sent a request for help to the hotline for a grassroots Memphis food pantry focused on serving immigrant families. Her plea reached Jessica Miller, a volunteer and spokesperson for The Collective Good Immigrant Pantry.
“She had been having to feed (the baby) sugar water for two days because she didn’t have any formula and the husband had gotten deported,” Miller said. “So we delivered formula and diapers.”
The pantry — run completely by volunteers out of garages and spare rooms — is ramping up its operations to meet surging needs as federal law enforcement agencies patrol the city as part of the Trump administration’s “Memphis Safe Task Force.”
The Collective Good collects and delivers boxes of food and hygiene essentials to families in need. This can include families in financial distress after a primary provider was detained or deported, or those who are afraid to leave their homes to get groceries.
“There’s so many situations we run into with people … the husband’s been deported, the person that provided for them, right? And then the mom is there with kids that are hungry and they don’t know what to do,” Miller said.
The pantry has also helped immigrant families who have decided to leave the U.S. out of fear, but cannot easily do so because their children are American citizens.
“The children need passports and paperwork,” she said. “It’s not as easy as people think to deport American citizens to another country.”

The pantry, part of the mutual aid arm of progressive organizing group Indivisible Memphis, launched its hotline in July following a string of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in primarily Hispanic neighborhoods, Miller said. A group of concerned advocates saw that “food was going to be a big need” for those who remained. 
From July until the task force’s arrival on Sept. 29, the pantry averaged a little over eight deliveries per week, meeting all requests submitted through the hotline. Last week, the pantry made 22 deliveries. At least 100 requests had poured in as of Oct. 8.
Of the requests received, at least half have come from families with babies in need of formula and diapers.
A local church recently hosted a “baby shower” for the pantry, collecting baby essentials to help the pantry meet growing needs. 
“Politics aside, I don’t know how anybody can look at … babies crying with hunger pain and not think that needs help, or that something’s wrong with that,” Miller said.
Federal task force tallies 562 arrests; exact charges are unclear
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi reported the task force made 562 total arrests and seized 144 illegal guns as of Thursday, before the arrival of National Guard troops on Friday. The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for further information about the charges related to those arrests.
Lead organizers for Free the 901, a coalition of Memphis advocacy groups steering response to the federal task force, say they have received hundreds of reports from community members of federal law enforcement agents from multiple agencies working alongside Tennessee Highway Patrol officers to conduct traffic stops throughout the city, particularly in areas with high concentrations of minority residents. 
Tennessee Lookout independently observed several traffic stops on Tuesday evening where agents wearing gear marked as FBI, U.S. Marshalls, Homeland Security Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were present alongside THP officers. 
THP did not respond by the time of publication  to requests for traffic stop data, and it’s unclear how many of the 562 arrests reported by the task force may have resulted from these traffic stops.
Information released to Tennessee Lookout by the Department of Justice on Oct. 7 indicated that roughly 24% of the 386 arrests to that point were done on “administrative ICE warrants.” These warrants are issued by ICE officers to remove non-citizens from the United States, according to Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) materials.
Administrative ICE warrants are not criminal warrants, are not signed by a judge or magistrate, and cannot be used to enter private areas such as individuals’ homes. While the “underlying basis for a non-citizen’s removability may be due to some criminal violation,” FLETC Senior Legal Instructor John Seaman stated in a training transcript, an administrative ICE warrant only indicates that an ICE official determined a person is “removable from the United States.”
The arrest data from Oct. 7 also indicated that 63 arrests were for “other” purposes and 125 were for “warrants,” with no additional information on the type of offense. Of the 386 arrests, two were for homicide charges, two were related to probation or parole, 20 were for sex offenses, 30 for narcotics and 50 for firearms-related charges.
Not a typical food bank
Miller describes the Collective Good Immigrant Pantry as a “true mutual aid network operating differently than traditional food banks, which sometimes require paperwork or identification.
The volunteers who started the pantry consulted with leaders in the Latino community to ensure that pantry boxes contain familiar ingredients and spices.
“We did this to fit the Latino community,” she said. “The systems that have failed us aren’t going to be the answer to this, so we decided that we’re going to be the answer for it.”
The pantry collects donations of nonperishable foods and hygiene items through its Amazon wishlist, and accepts cash donations to ensure that each delivery also contains fresh dairy, meat and produce.

Volunteers try to pack the boxes with enough food to feed families for a week. They also include items like coffee and lotion, because “we recognize that even though they’re going through the most traumatic time of their life, they still deserve some happy in their life, too,” Miller said.
Families in need reach out to the pantry’s hotline and provide details on the numbers of adults and children needing food, as well as any allergies. Volunteers then deliver the boxes directly. 
Along with meeting emergent needs, the pantry connects families with longer-term resources offered by other advocacy groups. 
When requests for help shot up, the small group of original pantry volunteers began to get overwhelmed and burnt out, Miller said, but then about 120 people from all over Shelby and surrounding counties answered a call for new volunteers.
“Every week I go into the new week praying that we’ll be able to help more people,” she said. “And sometimes it gets to the point where we’re a little low on funds or low on supplies, but it’s always provided so far.”
Miller said she looks forward to the day when the food bank initiative is not needed, but until that point, her goal is for “our voices to be louder than the ones saying this (federal task force) is what our city needs to make it better.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Memphis-Food-Bank002-1024x651.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

If you’re a longtime follower of North Carolina politics and local news, you might know me from my seven years as Capitol Bureau Chief at WUNC/NC Public Radio, or the blog I wrote there for many years, Isaac Hunter’s Tavern, or from my 14 years as Capitol Bureau Chief at WRAL.
I’ve worked on many fulfilling and award-winning projects over those years, including a series on poverty at WUNC that won a duPont-Columbia Silver Baton for public service. And, of course, I’ve been in the thick of coverage of political contests in the national spotlight, like the 2024 N.C. Supreme court race, the 2024 N.C. gubernatorial race, and our state’s seemingly endless court battles over redistricting, from county courts to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Over that time, I’ve watched Democrats and Republicans rise and fall, from Jim Black and Mike Easley to Robin Hayes and Mark Harris. What I’ve learned is that unchecked power — no matter whose hands it’s in — is never good for the people those officials serve.
That’s why I don’t believe either side has a monopoly on good ideas. I’ve spent the past 21 years explaining to North Carolinians why their state lawmakers have passed certain laws and how those laws and regulations will affect their lives. That will not change now that I’m at NC Newsline. 
We’re here to ask the questions you might ask and tell you how your elected officials did or didn’t answer them.
And when it comes to election coverage, our focus will be on policy instead of the horserace. You can see poll results anywhere. Smart explorations of the issues that matter to you are much harder to come by. That’s what we’re here for. Not to take sides.
We’ll continue to deliver the in-depth coverage for which you’ve come to rely on us. Greg Childress, Lynn Bonner and Clayton Henkel will still bring their years of experience to bear. Ahmed Jallow, Brandon Kingdollar, Christine Zhu and Galen Bacharier will keep bringing their sharp eyes and new perspectives to what we do. Former editor Rob Schofield will continue to provide commentary.
I won’t be writing many columns. I prefer to leave that to those who aren’t involved in daily reporting and editing, although I reserve the right to weigh in on First Amendment and press freedom issues, or course!
I believe an educated electorate is necessary to make democracy work, and what you can learn about your government shouldn’t depend on how much money you make. State policy affects everyone, especially those who are least able to pay to find out about it.
That’s why we’re working hard to expand our reach. There are a lot of small local newspapers and news sites in North Carolina that can’t afford wire services. We want to bring their readers quality coverage of their state government. Donations from readers like you can help us do that.
Thank you for reading. We’ll be here. We hope you will, too.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)TEKAMAH, Neb. — After a months-long dispute, the maintenance of several rural cemeteries in Burt County seems to have reached a resolution, not through the creation of a new board, but a much simpler answer.
Some residents have been pleading with the Tekamah Cemetery District to boost their efforts to maintain three rural cemeteries within the district’s boundaries. Several contend that the board is too focused on maintaining the largest cemetery in the area — Tekamah Cemetery — and let the other cemeteries fall into disrepair.
“When you see the scale of it, it’s so one-sided,” said one resident Lisa Anderson.
Months went by with little to no progress until Anderson proposed at the board’s Sept. 18 meeting that the residents themselves could oversee the maintenance through a separate rural cemetery board. The board agreed to consider this option, and left open the possibility of siphoning off more than $16,000 of its $154,000 budget for the new board.
But at the board’s latest meeting Tuesday, member John Chamberlain said he was unsure that the new board would be legally sound. He later explained that since their board is a bonded agency and the rural board wouldn’t be, that may cause complications.
“There’s a lot of hurdles to jump before we can do this,” Chamberlain said.

The primary need the residents are concerned about is mowing. At the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery, grass and weeds have begun to grow over some of the headstones. Church members claim the cemetery hasn’t been mowed since May, when prior to that the cemetery board had regularly maintained it for decades.
Board members said they had received advice from the Burt County assessor that determined the board shouldn’t continue caring for the cemetery because the land is privately owned by the church, though the cemetery’s defenders argue the cemetery remains public.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the meeting, board members clarified that the board continued to spend money on mowing two of the other rural cemeteries, Arizona and Silver Creek. Crew member Mike Camron said he and his team mow the two cemeteries about once a month.
By comparison, Tekamah Cemetery gets mowed almost daily. One reason: This cemetery is the largest in the county — about 70 acres — so it takes a full week to finish mowing the full property, Camron said.
By the end of the week, grass that was mowed on Monday is in need of mowing again, Camron said. This challenge is part of the reason why care for the rural cemeteries has lagged, Chamberlain said.
Weeds grow over a headstone at the Tekamah Rural Seventh Day Adventist Cemetery. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)
On Tuesday, the board proposed a different solution. Members agreed to increase the mowing of Arizona and Silver Creek cemeteries to twice a month. Additionally, they approved setting aside a maximum of $3,625 to pay for mowing the Seventh Day Adventist cemetery up to eight times before the cemetery board’s next budget cycle begins on June 30. The board tasked residents with finding a mowing contractor who can do the work within the price range.
Chamberlain told the Nebraska Examiner that state statutes offer little clarity on the board’s authority to care for private land that houses a public cemetery. Eventually, he said the board “got tired of fighting” residents on the issue, which led to the proposal.
“We came here tonight to work with you,” Chamberlain told the roughly 20 attendees at the meeting.
At one point, the board considered splitting the cost of mowing the church cemetery 50/50 with the residents, based on the private land vs. public cemetery conflict, Chamberlain said. Ultimately, members decided against that option and agreed to handle the funding.
Meeting attendees appeared pleased with the outcome, especially as one said she had a relative who may be able to mow the church cemetery. One attendee called the resolution a “win-win” for both parties.

An employee to operate this lab and help place students in internships won't be funded following federal grant cuts. (Photo provided by Central Carolina)A tutoring hub, a center to help students land jobs after earning their diploma and an academic advising office to keep students on track to graduate — these are all things Central Carolina Technical College has been able to add to its campus over the past 15 years with the help of federal grant funds awarded to colleges with a large percentage of minority students.
But now that grant program is ending, as the U.S. Department of Education claws back $350 million in funds for schools with large populations of Hispanic, Black, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islander students.
Because of this, Central Carolina won’t receive the nearly $350,000 it had left on its five-year, $1.6 million grant, said Lisa Bracken, the college’s vice president of student affairs.
“That $1.6 million, for us, was an awful lot of money,” she said.
How the grant was used
The college was using this latest grant round for three things — a program to flag and help students at risk of dropping or failing out of school, a staff member dedicated to placing healthcare students in internships and clinicals and a team of degree advisers.
Central Carolina, which has its main campus in Sumter plus three satellite campuses in Manning, Camden and Bishopville, managed to get budget approvals from the General Assembly to make four of these grant-funded employees permanent hires.
“Had we not done that, every bit of this would have gone away,” Bracken said, of those positions.
But the school had to let go two workers it could no longer pay, forcing other employees to take on the extra workload.

Nationwide, more than $250 million of the recalled federal funding was for the government’s Hispanic-Serving Institution program, which offers grants to colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic.
There was also $22 million for schools where at least 40% of the students are Black. The remaining $28 million went to schools with large populations of other minority groups.
In addition to Central Carolina, two other South Carolina colleges — Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College and Florence-Darlington Technical College — lost funding under the program for what are known as Predominantly Black Institutions, according to Kelly Steinhilper, a spokeswoman for the state technical college system.
Neither of the other two schools responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
Exempt from cuts
Tribal colleges and historically Black colleges and universities, which are open to all students regardless of race, are exempt from the cuts and will actually receive more funding as the Education Department redistributes a total of $495 million from the grant money and other cancelled funds.
How much of that one-time funding will go to South Carolina HBCUs is unclear.
South Carolina State University, the state’s only public four-year HBCU, is waiting for additional details about how the Education Department will distribute the funding, spokesman Sam Watson said.
“SC State continues to work to ensure that our students have fair and adequate access to resources,” he said. “We will evaluate the specifics of this investment once they are available to determine its potential impact on SC State.”
The state’s six private HBCUs declined to comment or did not respond to the Gazette’s messages.
How cancelled National Institutes of Health grants are impacting SC college students

In eliminating the grants, the Education Department claimed they violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause and its implied guarantees to equal protection. The department argues that these programs create unconstitutional “racial quotas.”
“Discrimination based upon race or ethnicity has no place in the United States,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. “Diversity is not merely the presence of a skin color. Stereotyping an individual based on immutable characteristics diminishes the full picture of that person’s life and contributions, including their character, resiliency, and merit.”
But Central Carolina is legislatively mandated to serve students across Sumter, Lee, Clarendon, and Kershaw counties. The school has about 800 full-time students, 2,200 part-time students and 590 high school students enrolled in classes, according to data from the state higher education agency.
The school’s student body, which is 45% Black and 57% minority, reflects the population of those counties and is not a product of efforts to recruit minority students, Bracken said.
The way the school used its grants also benefited all students — not just students of color.
“The assumption is that those funds are helping a small number of students and that is not the case,” Bracken said.
Getting programs off the ground
The money allowed the college to pilot several programs, helping get those initiatives off the ground.
“Without those funds, we would have had a very difficult time building a tutoring center from the ground up,” Bracken said. “We also used it to build out a Career Services Center. Before we had that grant, we provided what career services we could through our admissions office, but we didn’t have the software tools or the center where students could get on computers.”
“It gets you out there to where you can launch some some key things that really make a difference with your students,” she said of the grant program.

Over the last four years, the school started an early alert program to try to keep students in school.
“If you’ve got a student who doesn’t show up for class during that first week, that’s a risk indicator,” Bracken said.
In the first week of this fall semester, the school already had almost 500 early alerts for students.
From there, a designated staff member, paid for by the grant, reached out to each of those students to find out why they hadn’t shown up and to let them know what services the school has available.
“Sometimes it’s ‘My work schedule has changed and I can’t make it to class. I’ve had a death in the family. We have a serious illness. I don’t have child care. I don’t have transportation,’ ” Bracken said. “Life issues have gotten in the way.”
But the students may not realize or don’t always remember the school and its partner organizations in the community can help.
“For example, somebody can’t pay their light bill and so they’re choosing to take extra shifts at work rather than come to class,” Bracken said. “We have some emergency money that we’re able to then pay their light bill for that month. Cars break down. We’ve paid for student car repairs.”
The school will now continue this early alert program using state funds.
What is ending
Before the grant allowed the school to hire designated advisers, professors were advising students on what classes to take. With thousands of students enrolled, it was easy for some to slip through the cracks, accidentally taking classes that may not count toward their degree and not knowing what classes might transfer if they chose to change their major.
The college also will continue the new advising program using state funds, minus a part-time adviser that worked at the school’s Camden campus.

The third program, which the college does not have the money to continue, was for a designated staff member trained to operate and maintain the school’s high-tech health care simulation lab. That staff member also made all of the clinical placements with the local hospitals for students to get on-the-job experience required for completing their degrees.
Those jobs will again fall back on the professors teaching those classes. The difference now is those degree programs have grown significantly.
Between an associate’s degree in nursing and a Licensed Practical Nursing program, surgical technology and medical assisting, the school has added 45 new students in the past five years. It’s pre-nursing program, which feeds into those other degrees, has doubled, going from 250 students to 500, Bracken said.
“We’re full every semester,” she said.
For now, Central Carolina will still receive funds under a similar, annual grant program, which is considered mandatory under federal law.
Even so, the Trump administrations’ Education Department in a statement said it “continues to consider the underlying legal issues associated with the mandatory funding mechanism in these programs.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CCTC_11282022_0045x7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)A billion-dollar bond proposal and a significant change to how at-large council members are elected are among the questions Denver voters will weigh in on in the city’s 2025 municipal election.

 Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.

Ballots began going out by mail Oct. 10 to all active registered voters in Colorado. The state’s coordinated 2025 election features two statewide ballot measures, Proposition LL and Proposition MM. Depending on where they live, voters will also be asked to weigh in on such items as local ballot issues, city council races, and school board races.
In the Mile High City, the off-year election features eight ballot measures, the first five of which comprise a $950 million package of Vibrant Denver infrastructure bonds backed by Mayor Mike Johnston. Two other questions were referred to the ballot by City Council. The eighth and final measure, known as a veto referendum, was placed on the ballot through a signature-gathering campaign by opponents of City Council’s passage of a flavored tobacco ban last year.

Election Day is Nov. 4. Eligible Coloradans can register to vote or update their registration at GoVoteColorado.com. Any eligible voter who registers to vote before Oct. 27 will receive a ballot in the mail. After Oct. 27, eligible voters can still register and vote in-person at a polling location until 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Voters who receive a mail ballot can return it through the mail, deposit it in a secure ballot drop box, or drop it off at an in-person polling location. County clerks in Colorado’s 64 counties oversee elections in their jurisdictions, and information about ballot drop box and in-person service locations is available at local county clerks’ websites.
 Vibrant Denver bond
Denver voters will decide whether to approve Ballot Issues 2A–2E, five pieces of the city’s proposed bond package individually: transportation and mobility projects totaling $441 million; parks and recreation projects totaling $175 million; health and human services projects totaling $30 million; city infrastructure and facilities projects totaling $244 million; and housing and shelter projects totaling $59 million.
City governments regularly issue bond proposals to finance infrastructure projects by taking on debt, without raising taxes. Other recent “general obligation” bond issues in Denver included the $260 million RISE Denver bond in 2021 and the $936 million Elevate Denver bond in 2017.
The city says more than 200 individual projects will be funded through the Vibrant Denver proposal. A combined $139 million would go towards rebuilding the Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue viaducts adjacent to the proposed site of a new Denver Broncos stadium in Burnham Yard. Other major projects include a new $75 million combined training facility for the city’s sheriff, police and fire departments and $70 million to transform the former Park Hill Golf Club into a new city park. A full list of projects is available on the city’s website.
An issue committee registered in support of measures 2A through 2E has received more than $1 million in contributions from a long list of Denver-based businesses, according to city campaign finance records. Its top donor is former MDC Holdings executive Larry Mizel, who contributed $65,000, while the Denver Zoo, Denver Art Museum and Denver Botanic Gardens are among those that have contributed $50,000 each.
Citizens for No New Debt, a committee registered by activist Jason Bailey, had spent $3,170 in opposition to the bond package as of Oct. 10.
 Renaming the Department of Excise and Licensing
Question 2F was referred to the ballot by Denver City Council. It would change the name of the Department of Excise and Licensing, which issues business and professional licenses to bars, marijuana dispensaries, contractors and dozens of other kinds of businesses within Denver. The ballot measure would update the agency’s name to the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection, and amend language throughout the city’s municipal code to reflect the change.
The department calls the name change “part of an effort to modernize and make it easier to understand city government agency services.” Its current name is “confusing and misleading,” it says, because the department no longer handles the collection of excise taxes.
 At-large council elections
Question 2G, referred to the ballot by Denver City Council, would change how the city elects its two at-large members, who represent the entire city alongside 11 other members elected at the district level.
Currently, all candidates for at-large council seats run in a single race, with the top two vote-getters winning the two seats. In 2023, at-large council members Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Sarah Parady won their seats with 20% and 16% of the vote, respectively, from a field of 10 candidates.
Question 2G would significantly overhaul that process, dividing the at-large contest into separate races for “A” and “B” seats, and subjecting them to a runoff election if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.
The question was narrowly approved for the ballot by a 7-6 council vote, with Gonzales-Gutierrez, Parady and other progressive members opposed. By the same vote, council members defeated a progressive-backed proposal to put a ranked choice voting measure on the city’s 2025 ballot.
Supporters of the ballot measure, including the seven moderate council members, say the current system is confusing and allows unrepresentative candidates to win without majority support. Opponents call it an effort to target two of the council’s most progressive members.
Hands Off Denver Elections, a campaign committee formed “to reduce the influence of special interest big money,” has registered to oppose Referred Question 2G but had not reported any contributions as of Oct. 10. Its treasurer is Wynn Howell, Colorado state director of the Working Families Party.
 Flavored tobacco ban
In 2024, Denver City Council voted 11-1 to pass a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, flavored e-cigarette cartridges and flavored pouches and chews. Critics say these products are marketed to young people and put them at risk of nicotine addiction and other health impacts.
Opponents of the ban organized a signature-gathering campaign and collected the 9,400 valid signatures required to place a veto referendum on the 2025 ballot.
A yes vote on Referendum 310 will keep the ban in place. A no vote will repeal the ban.
A committee in support of the ban, Denver Kids vs. Big Tobacco, has raised more than $2 million to encourage a yes vote on Referendum 310, according to campaign finance records. Three-quarters of that funding came from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a longtime benefactor of anti-tobacco causes.
Citizen Power, a committee registered to oppose the ban, has received over $434,000 in contributions from donors including the Rocky Mountain Smoke Free Alliance, a vaping industry trade group, as well as tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris.

(Getty Images)Idaho’s public schools are a historic place of pride in Idaho’s growth and cultural development. They continue to anchor communities’ social structures by providing actual places that signify community unity. Beyond being just places of learning, they are where we vote, see our children grow and mature into social beings, sponsor organized sports, music, and arts, and provide a stage for public participation in political and civic discussion. In many of Idaho’s smaller rural communities, they strum as the region’s most vital organ.
The drafters of Idaho’s constitution recognized the local importance of public schools by requiring that the state establish and maintain a “general, uniform, and thorough system of public, free common schools in a safe environment conducive to learning” for all school districts in the state.
Advocacy coalition files lawsuit to block Idaho’s new private school tax credit

In its 2004 and 2006 opinions in litigation against the state brought by the Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity, however, the Idaho Supreme Court exposed the failure to adequately fund our public schools. Sadly, instead of responding to these decisions with increased public-school funding, our Legislature has gone in a different direction, further damaging the state’s public school system. 
 In the 2025 session of the Idaho Legislature, the Legislature passed, and the governor signed, House Bill 93, providing up to $5,000 per student tax credit ($7,500 for special needs students) for any pupil enrolled in a private school. This law will contribute significantly to the continued gutting of our public school system for the benefit of a select and elite few.
Private secondary schools in Idaho costs on average between $9,000 and $12,000 per year, depending upon the set of sources reviewed. Thus, unless a family can pony up about double what the state offers for each student, private schooling will remain the privilege of richer families. 
A recent national study discovered that students already enrolled in private schools are the biggest beneficiaries of new voucher programs. Not surprising, the same study found some private schools used the new voucher money to raise their tuition charges. Thus, overall, the same fortunate few go to private schools, but the schools get more money at taxpayer expense. A pretty good boondoggle if a family already enjoys that system, but not much of benefit for the less prosperous.  
The House Bill 93 giveaway does not contain any performance measurements. While our public schools operate under a gaze measuring the quality of outcomes, House Bill 93 spending has no such dimension. There exists no means in the new private school subsidy to gauge whether state funding of private schools provides any successful education. The bill openly invites charlatans and hucksters into Idaho’s educational space.
House Bill 93 devotes $50 million annually to the new voucher subsidy for the well-to-do. This makes no economic sense for Idaho. 
While the Legislature wants to give the advantaged more advantages, we currently suffer a $79.9 million shortfall in the current fiscal year general budget, causing a 3% holdback to some state budgets, and a separate $60 million shortfall in our Medicaid budget.
 If this voucher giveaway went away, it would cover most of one of these shortfalls. This must make any taxpayer who cannot afford a private school for their children cringe at the unfairness of this system. And those of us who live in or near Idaho towns that do not have private schools cannot even participate in the system.
More disheartening, while Idaho’s investment in public school spending has fallen 15% in the last 20 years, we can expect the voucher subsidy to bloat about 200% to 300% in the next ten years, as it did in Florida, Arizona, and Indiana.   
House Bill 93 is simply a bad idea funded by all taxpayers for the benefit of a chosen few and private businesses at a time when Idaho suffers budget shortfalls. The better idea is to properly fund our constitutional public school system for the benefit of us all.

As many as 845 people incarcerated in Mississippi Department of Corrections facilities were confirmed to be living with hepatitis C between January and March of this year, records show. During the same period, 48 people – or less than 6% with documented diagnoses – received treatment. 
But in private, officials have at times cited a much higher caseload – 5,000 cases out of about 19,000 people incarcerated by the state. This suggests that public records may reveal only a small portion of a widespread hepatitis C problem in Mississippi’s prisons, a state lawmaker with direct oversight over the corrections department told Mississippi Today. 
As people in the care of the state suffer and the treatable illness continues to fester, she said, officials aren’t using resources available to them to lower the costs of medications. 
This year’s treatment numbers represent an improvement over last year, when 19 people in state prisons – or 2% with diagnoses – received medication for hepatitis C. In 2020, only three people received treatment.

Department of Corrections spokesperson Kate Head did not answer questions from Mississippi Today about why at least hundreds of people in its custody with the contagious illness are not receiving treatment. But she said the agency’s medical contractor “is responsible for providing appropriate medical treatment to inmates with all medical conditions, including Hep C.” 
VitalCore Health Strategies, a company that holds a three-year, $357-million contract to provide medical care to Mississippi prisoners, declined to comment. The company was previously awarded over $315 million in emergency, no-bid state contracts from 2020 to 2024.
Data obtained by Mississippi Today show a clear disparity between the number of people who test positive for the virus and the number of people who receive treatment. 
Behind closed doors, state officials and VitalCore executives have been briefed on a much larger volume of cases, House Corrections Chairwoman Rep. Becky Currie told Mississippi Today. 
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita in the world. Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, has oversight of Mississippi’s prison system and those who manage it. During a private meeting at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County with some of these leaders, Currie said Dr. Raman Singh, VitalCore’s chief medical officer, told her and State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney that about 5,000 MDOC prisoners and some prison workers had contracted hepatitis C. 
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain shared the same number with her in a separate meeting, Currie said. 
Singh did not respond to requests for comment.

MDOC and VitalCore did not respond to questions about whether such conversations occurred. Department of Health spokesperson Greg Flynn said Dr. Edney did not believe it would be appropriate to comment on a private conversation, but he said it “absolutely could be the case” that as many as 5,000 people incarcerated in Mississippi suffer from hepatitis C. 
Mississippi Today identified inconsistencies in testing and diagnosis numbers, such as low numbers of tests that resulted in large increases in new diagnoses, obtained through public-records requests. “Data collection and streamlining of the reception and diagnostic unit” contributed to the discrepancies, Head said.

During a series of tours of Mississippi prisons last year, Currie, who is a registered nurse, said she witnessed prisoners suffering from a wide range of health ailments, including hepatitis C, without treatment. The suffering is preventable, and raises questions about how hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent, she said.
Currie called the denial of hepatitis C medication in Mississippi prisons a “public health crisis” that she couldn’t look away from as a nurse and a Christian. 
“This is morally wrong,” she said. 
A cure to count on
Hepatitis C can be treated with a type of highly effective antiviral medication that cures more than 95% of patients in a matter of weeks. Nonetheless, there are over 10,000 hepatitis C-related deaths in the U.S. each year.
Left untreated, the contagious blood-borne virus can cause serious health problems, including liver disease, liver failure and cancer. It is the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S. 
Hepatitis C proliferates in state prisons across the country, where its prevalence is nine times greater than the general population. 
Risk factors for hepatitis C, such as injecting drugs, overlap with those for incarceration, said Dr. Anne Spaulding, an associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who studies hepatitis C in prisons. She formerly served as medical director for the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. 
Spaulding said prisons should make the medication available to every person who wants treatment.
“There should be no reason why a prison can’t treat most of their patients,” Spaulding said.
The first treatment for hepatitis C arrived in the 1980s. But the medication had low success rates and debilitating side effects, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, depression and suicidal ideation. 
A major scientific advance in the early 2010s – direct-acting antiviral drugs – transformed treatment regimens, offering high cure rates, shorter treatment durations and fewer side effects. 
“The cure is something that you can really count on,” Spaulding said. “So it’s gone from a difficult-to-treat infection to an infection that is much, much simpler and effective (to treat).”
But the breakthrough in treatment has meant little for most Mississippi prisoners with hepatitis C, who have been fighting for years to receive the medication in prison. 
“It is a problem that has been left so long without any answers,” Currie said. 
In 2017, Chad Spiers, then incarcerated at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Leakesville, filed a lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the medical contractor at the time for denying him medication after he tested positive for hepatitis C. 
Magistrate Judge Robert H. Walker dismissed Spiers’ complaint, ruling that his care was constitutional because, though he did not receive medication, he was monitored for progression of the illness. 
“The Constitution guarantee (sic) prisoners ‘only adequate, not optimal medical care,’” reads the ruling. 
The Department of Corrections’ hepatitis management policy obtained by Mississippi Today says it will provide treatment for people with hepatitis C diagnoses “when indicated.” Spokesperson Head did not respond to questions about which cases warrant treatment. 
But a person with direct knowledge of medical care inside Mississippi’s prisons, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about how inmates are treated, said prisons are financially incentivized to wait to treat inmates until they get sick enough for prison officials to justify purchasing the expensive medication. 
“(Prison staff) were told he’s not sick enough yet,” the person said. 
The medication can cost the Mississippi system almost $30,000 for a six-week course, the person said. 
However, many state prison systems have negotiated cheaper prices for the medication and are able to treat more patients.
Delaying treatment runs counter to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which say clinicians should treat people and not wait for the illness to resolve spontaneously.
The CDC’s guidance should be applied to people who are incarcerated, said Dr. Kate LeMasters, as assistant professor at the University of Colorado who studies the public health implications of the prison system.
Most people with hepatitis C do not have symptoms, and about 25% will spontaneously clear the infection without treatment. The disease is slow moving and can take years for symptoms to show. But left untreated, it can wreak havoc on a person’s immune system, turning their skin yellow from jaundice and causing joint pain that leaves them immobile. Its longer-term health consequences, such as liver failure and cancer, are life-threatening.
“What we do now is that we let them get sick and die, or we let them get so sick that they get a liver disease, cirrhosis or cancer, and they die,” Currie said. 
Disincentives and unused discounts
Even as the price of costly medication has fallen and treatment has become more effective, some state prison systems argue that treating hepatitis C is prohibitively expensive. 
Several states have negotiated innovative payment models to treat people and prevent the spread of the disease inside and outside of prison walls. 
Some use what is called the “Netflix” model – a subscription-based program that gives a state unlimited treatment doses during a fixed period. Other states have negotiated lower costs with pharmaceutical companies or obtained the medication through health care organizations enrolled in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices. The program can offer discounts on drugs in the range of 20% to 50%. 
In its February 2024 contract proposal, VitalCore wrote it was “confident” it would be able to access discounted prices for hepatitis C medications using the 340B program. 
“We have had tremendous success in accessing 340B purchasing and pricing in other similar contracts for the purpose of purchasing more expensive medications such as those for the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C,” the proposal reads. 
In the 2025 legislative session, a bill proposed by Currie would have required the Mississippi Departments of Health and Corrections to establish a hepatitis C program for inmates and work to obtain the medication at a discounted price through the 340B program. 
The legislation passed the House with a large bipartisan majority, but didn’t survive negotiations with the Senate, in part because of a disagreement over the bill’s proposed audit of prison health care. 
MDOC and VitalCore did not respond to questions about whether they receive 340B pricing for hepatitis C drugs. University of Mississippi Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital system, did not respond to a request for comment about whether the hospital partners with VitalCore to obtain discounted hepatitis C medication. 
The Department of Health provided MDOC information about how to access 340B pricing several months ago, but the agency has not yet taken steps to obtain the reduced prices, Health Department spokesperson Flynn told Mississippi Today. 
“The Department of Health has given information about how to go about getting 340B pricing and joining the program to the Department of Corrections,” Flynn said. “But to our knowledge, they are not utilizing the 340B, at least not that we know of right now.” 
This means the Corrections Department isn’t making use of the tools it has to purchase hepatitis C medications at a cheaper price, Currie said. 
“They’ve been able to get it all along,” she said.
A fate no one deserves
One study suggests it is most cost-effective to test and treat hepatitis C widely and provide linkage to care when people are released from prison because it prevents expensive complications and limits the spread of the infection. 
“It’s going to cost the taxpayers more because we don’t initially treat it,” Currie said. 
Currie told Mississippi Today she has personally asked the corrections department to treat several people she met while touring the prison system last year. One was “literally about on his deathbed” before receiving treatment, but has shown significant improvement since receiving medication, she said. 
Despite evidence that suggests broad testing and treatment save money in the long run, Mississippi does not test widely for hepatitis C. Testing is performed “when deemed clinically indicated by the healthcare providers,” who take into consideration risk factors and the probability a patient has hepatitis C, Head said. 
Incarceration itself is a risk factor for hepatitis C, given its high prevalence in prisons, LeMasters said. 
“Everyone should be screened when entering prison because people who have a history of incarceration are considered at risk,” she said. 
Opt-out testing, where patients are tested unless they specifically decline it, is the most effective way to identify hepatitis C, Spaulding said. 
Incarcerated people are one of the few groups in the U.S. with a constitutional right to health care. MDOC has told Mississippi Today that it provides health care to prisoners that meets constitutional standards. 
But a former top corrections official, after reading Mississippi Today’s coverage of prison health care issues, turned over internal communications to the news outlet that revealed top prison officials bemoaning the poor medical care provided to prisoners. 
Inside prison facilities, hepatitis C patients are denied lifesaving medication – a fate no one, not even people convicted of crimes, deserves, Currie said. 
“Our whole ‘because you’re in jail, we don’t care if you die’ program really doesn’t work for me,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10114223/mt-prison-health-story3-featimage-03_720.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) An international organization that seeks to protect water quality in the Red River will conduct a review of two large dairy projects underway in North Dakota. 
The provincial government of Manitoba announced in a news release that the International Joint Commission has directed its International Red River Watershed Board to review information and permits related to the dairy operations.
Minnesota-based Riverview LLP plans to build two milking operations near the Red River, which flows north into Canada and Lake Winnipeg — the Herberg Dairy in Traill County with 25,000 cows and the Abercrombie Dairy in Richland County with 12,500 cows. 
Both dairies have received permits from the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. That agency considers issues such as protecting groundwater and preventing polluted runoff into waterways. 
Marty Haroldson, director of the Division of Water Quality for the environmental agency, said it would answer questions or provide information to the International Joint Commission.
Manitoba Environment and Climate Change Minister Mike Moyes supported the decision by the International Joint Commission to assess the impacts of the projects on the Red River.
“The health of Manitoba’s lakes and rivers is a top priority for our government, and we want to be sure that developments upstream don’t negatively affect Lake Winnipeg and the Red River,” Moyes said in a news release Thursday. “We must protect Lake Winnipeg for generations to come.”
The Manitoba government and environmental groups are concerned about algae blooms in Lake Winnipeg, the world’s 10th largest fresh water lake. Nutrients from fertilizers, including cow manure, can contribute to algae blooms.

A letter from Moyes to North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong outlined the provincial government’s concerns. The letter said water quality monitoring in the Red River at the U.S.-Canada border shows that levels of nutrients are above target levels set by the two countries in 2022. 
In an emailed statement, Armstrong’s office said North Dakota follows state and federal laws related to permitting agricultural facilities. 
“Our state agencies apply the same high standards for protecting the Red River that they apply to all waters within North Dakota, and we have some of the safest drinking water in the country,” the Governor’s Office said.
The Manitoba Eco-Network, an environmental group, says Lake Winnipeg is one of the world’s most-threatened lakes with high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus that can come from fertilizers. 
The state permits show that the cows from the two dairies would produce about 214 million gallons of manure each year. 
Environmental agency approves permit for large eastern North Dakota dairy

“Our dairies are designed, built and operated to be protective of the environment for generations to come,” Riverview said in a statement Friday. “Discharges to surface waters are prohibited by state and federal law, and our farms are designed and operated to meet or exceed strict environmental standards.”
Riverview squeezes out the liquid from its manure, separating it from the solids. The liquid manure is then transported through pipes or hoses to be injected into the soil of a farm field. There are no trucks hauling the liquid manure. 
Ted Preister, executive director of the Red River Basin Commission, a nonprofit group that has members from the U.S. and Canada, said the dairies have been a topic of discussion this summer, with Canadian officials seeking to learn more about the existing Riverview dairy operations in Minnesota and the planned dairies in North Dakota. 
He said the potential for 37,500 cows along the Red River is “a substantial concern” to Canadians who value Lake Winnipeg for its commercial fishing and recreation. 
Preister said the International Joint Commission can review permits to look for errors and can review water sampling reports to monitor for changes. If the commission finds something of concern, it would be up to Canada’s federal government to appeal to the U.S. Department of State. The commission’s findings could also be used in a legal challenge, he said. 
Preister said a visit to a Riverview dairy in Minnesota included Canadian representatives from the International Joint Commission, which can investigate pollution and water quality questions. 
He said Canadians asked “very pointed” questions of North Dakota’s Department of Environmental Quality, which approved permits for the two dairies.

Phone messages left with the International Joint Commission were not returned Friday.
Canada and the United States created the International Joint Commission to manage lakes and rivers along their border. 
The International Red River Watershed Board is an independent group established by the International Joint Commission under the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. The board assists the commission in preventing or resolving disputes regarding the Red River and its tributaries. 
Madeline Luke has been the point person for the Dakota Resource Council on the group’s concerns about the large dairies.
“Pollution, like water, has no boundaries,” Luke said in an email. “The IJC is a non-political body with deep technical expertise. So with the urgent need to avoid further harm to Lake Winnipeg, this action is much applauded.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Arguments about the First Amendment, which, to many, is the most sacrosanct of the articles in the U.S. Constitution Bill of Rights, are a constant in American democracy. 
Witness how Tennessee’s new buffer zone law demanding journalists stay 25 feet from law enforcement could trip up reporters in Memphis trying to document federal forces— including agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, U.S. Marshals and Drug Enforcement Administration plus an extra 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers and members of the Tennessee National Guard — occupying the majority Black city by the hundreds.
In the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers passed the measure to establish a 25-foot “buffer zone” that allows law enforcement officers to order members of the media and public to remain 25 feet away from crime scenes, traffic stops and any “ongoing and immediate threat to public safety.”
The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland Republican, and Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, creates a Class B misdemeanor for violations of the buffer zone. 
Bill expanding Tennessee law enforcement powers during protests draws pushback

“As you can imagine, journalists appear within 25 feet of law enforcement officers doing their day job every day,” said Grayson Clary, staff attorney with Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP,) which provides legal support to journalists. 
Similar laws have been challenged in Indiana and Louisiana, where lawyers with the RCFP have prevailed and obtained preliminary injunctions to enforcement of the laws. 
The Lookout is part of a coalition of Tennessee media outlets and companies, including the Nashville Banner, Gannett, Scripps Media and TEGNA that has sued the state of Tennessee in federal court over the new law. 
“These buffer laws jeopardize reporters’ ability to bring their communities some of the news that matters most — about crime, disaster response, police misconduct, and more,” said Clary, who is representing the media coalition alongside Paul McAdoo, RCFP’s Local Legal Initiative attorney for Tennessee. “When law enforcement pushes the press out of eye and earshot, it’s the public that ultimately loses out.”
On October 3, six Memphis area state lawmakers sent a letter to WHBQ Fox 13, accusing the station of endangering law enforcement officials for airing a link to a tip line. 
Fox 13 asked viewers to let the station know about locations of task force operations and agents as they engaged with detentions and arrests throughout the city, presumably so their reporters and photographers could observe and report on the activities of the Memphis Safe Communities Task Force. 
Sen. Paul Rose, a Shelby County Republican, accused a Memphis TV station of threatening federal law enforcement after Fox 13 posted a tip line. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
This is Journalism 101. Every news outlet worth its salt, including the Lookout, asks readers or viewers to provide story tips. 
Yet, state Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican, seemed to find it unusual. “It is outrageous that a local TV station would work against these efforts by tipping off offenders and endangering the officers sworn to protect us. This irresponsible reporting must stop so law enforcement can do its job without interference,” he said in a press release sent by state House Republican Caucus staff. 
If armed federal law enforcement and Tennessee Highway Patrol officers can’t manage being photographed by TV journalists, they might not be best equipped to deal with the more serious issues of crime they are allegedly in Memphis to handle . Surely, these hundreds of agents aren’t so fragile they need the protection of a handful of state lawmakers. 
This raises the question of why our elected officials would want to call out reporters and imply they are a threat. These are the same lawmakers who often pledge strict allegiance to the Constitution and to smaller government: Rose’s website says he’s a “strong believer in less government,” yet here he is, inserting government into an industry expressly protected by the First Amendment. 
One wonders if Tennessee’s lawmakers don’t understand the Constitution as well as they claim to or if this is another case of overreach by members of the legislature’s supermajority because they can. Either way, the continued treading on free speech and the free press won’t stand: Tennessee’s media outlets, including the Lookout, will continue to bring accountability to the public and uphold the First Amendment.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Maryland this month finalized a $340 million deal with Constellation Energy to relicense the Conowingo Dam in Cecil County, ending years of litigation and regulatory uncertainty. The agreement restores the state’s authority to enforce water quality standards under the Clean Water Act and sets a possible precedent for dozens of hydroelectric relicensing cases nationwide expected in coming years.
The deal includes direct and associated investments in habitat restoration, trash and debris removal, aquatic life passage and other environmental priorities.
The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) will have oversight of the agreement, with input from two advocacy groups—Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association—who challenged and helped overturn an earlier settlement they argued was legally and environmentally deficient.
The revised settlement reasserts a 2018 Water Quality Certification that Maryland had previously waived in its 2019 deal with Exelon, the dam’s previous operator. That waiver prompted the advocacy groups to file a legal challenge, leading to a 2023 federal appeals court ruling that tossed the license granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The new agreement binds Constellation, the dam’s current operator, to terms enforceable by both state and federal regulators.
Gov. Wes Moore hailed the agreement as a major step for environmental protection and energy security.
“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Moore said in a statement. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers. By bringing everyone to the table, we have struck an agreement that is good for the environment, good for energy production, and good for Marylanders.”
Environmental advocates also celebrated the deal as precedent-setting.
“This agreement shows what can be accomplished with the Clean Water Act as it is,” said Evan Isaacson, senior attorney with the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, who represented the environmental groups in the case. “Constellation and all parties are legally bound by the terms of the settlement.”
The Conowingo Dam, located on the Susquehanna River, the Bay’s biggest tributary, has long been a thorny issue in Bay restoration efforts. For more than a decade, advocates maintained that the dam’s reservoir, intended to trap sediment and nutrients flowing downstream, was filled with silt that reduced its effectiveness. During large storm events, massive pollution loads from the reservoir escaped into the Bay, exacerbating reduced oxygen or “dead” zones and upending cleanup goals.
Under the new settlement, Constellation has committed to spending $340 million over the 50-year license term, with restoration efforts focused on areas within Maryland’s side of the Lower Susquehanna watershed. Of the total committed sum, $87.6 million will go to pollution reduction and resiliency projects, including shoreline restoration and planting of underwater grasses that produce oxygen, stabilize sediments and provide habitat for countless species.
Another $77.8 million is allocated for removing trash and debris, while $28 million will go to improving fish and eel passage at the dam. A freshwater mussel hatchery, aimed at natural water filtration, will receive $23.3 million. The settlement also includes funding for invasive species control and other restoration priorities.
Just $18.7 million is designated for dredging studies and related activities. Environmentalists and scientists remain split on whether dredging is the right solution. Studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state of Maryland have found dredging to be expensive—costing billions of dollars over decades—and potentially disruptive to aquatic life.
Still, groups like the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper argue that without some removal of the built-up sediment, the dam will remain a significant source of Bay pollution.
In written comments to Inside Climate News, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Ted Evgeniadis said his organization’s appeal of the 2019 license centered on its failure to address the sediment buildup behind the dam. “The dam alters the timing and delivery of sediment and nutrients to the river and Bay by scour events,” Evgeniadis said. “Providing a pathway for dredging was one of our top priorities.”
He described the 2025 agreement as a durable framework with meaningful oversight provisions, particularly in early implementation years. His organization will participate in annual consultations on how the mitigation fund is used, including around dredging. Evgeniadis noted that future federal funding may be needed to cover the costs of actual dredging if it proceeds.
“The agreement provides Maryland with funding to get many different projects done,” he said. “For dredging particularly, there will be a need for future support from the Maryland delegation and/or federal government for funding gaps to get the initial upfront investments going.”
Evgeniadis said his benchmarks for the agreement’s success include expanded biodiversity, increased migratory fish passage and fewer sediment runoff events from the dam, all of which could reduce the frequency and severity of dead zones in the Bay.
But some experts are skeptical that dredging will significantly change the trajectory of Bay cleanup efforts.
Donald Boesch, a leading estuarine scientist and former president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, said the data simply doesn’t support it.
Boesch pointed to the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) goals, the pollution diet for the Bay. He noted that 34 million pounds of nitrogen and 1.7 million pounds of phosphorus still need to be reduced from the Susquehanna to meet those targets. By contrast, the estimated impact of sediment buildup behind the dam adds 6 million pounds of nitrogen and 0.3 million pounds of phosphorus to that load.
“Upstream controls are a seven-times bigger challenge,” Boesch said. “The $88 million water-quality portion of the agreement should strive to achieve these offsetting load reductions.”
He said that multiple studies, including those by the Army Corps, have concluded dredging the Conowingo reservoir would be extremely costly and of limited effectiveness. “The agreement includes a further assessment of feasibility and effectiveness, not large-scale dredging per se,” Boesch said.
Despite this long-running disagreement, advocates and experts agreed that the settlement’s most significant feature is the reassertion of Maryland’s authority under Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. The clause allows states to place conditions on federally licensed projects to ensure compliance with state water quality standards.
Isaacson, of the Chesapeake Legal Alliance, said the 2019 settlement fell short in part because it attempted to retroactively waive this authority. “The previous attempt to waive the 2018 certification was found to be invalid by a federal appellate court,” he said, implying that the previous settlement left no enforceable mechanism to get the dam owner to fulfill its obligations.
The new agreement, he said, gives Maryland the tools to hold Constellation accountable. “They know MDE, FERC, the Waterkeepers, elected officials and the public are watching, and they know what they publicly committed to,” Isaacson said.
Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association now have a formal role in monitoring compliance, including input on project priorities funded by the settlement. Constellation, which took over dam operations from Exelon in early 2022, is required to maintain a website for public disclosure of non-confidential documents submitted to MDE, while the agency itself will keep a separate webpage dedicated to the dam’s licensing.
Robin Broder, acting executive director of Waterkeepers Chesapeake, said the revised settlement is a major step forward and emphasized the importance of launching restoration projects early. “Many of the payments are frontloaded so projects can be launched early in the license’s term so we begin to see restoration and improvements of fisheries, habitats and water quality as soon as possible,” she said.
Broder said that while the settlement doesn’t impose binding requirements on upstream states like Pennsylvania and New York, where the majority of the Susquehanna’s nutrient pollution originates, it includes a commitment to advocate for stronger conditions in future relicensing of upstream dams such as Holtwood and Safe Harbor.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which was not a party to the settlement but joined legal challenges to the 2019 waiver, also welcomed the new agreement. Paul Smail, the foundation’s vice president for litigation and general counsel, said the revised deal offers stronger environmental commitments and accountability.
“The biggest difference is that the Waterkeepers were not at the negotiation table in 2019,” Smail said. “In this current 2025 agreement, there is more funding available for environmental mitigation projects.”
Smail said Constellation should be held responsible for maintaining sediment levels in the dam’s pool, but stressed that upstream pollution reductions are just as important. “The dam affects how and when sediment and nutrients, particularly phosphorus during sediment scouring events, are released into Chesapeake Bay,” he said. “However, it’s also critical that upstream sources of the sediment and nutrient pollution must be reduced.”
He said the public should expect to see clear deliverables over the first five years, especially on restoration and resiliency projects in the Maryland portion of the watershed. “The actions of the Waterkeepers on behalf of the public, and ongoing citizen enforcement, have been and will continue to be key to accountability,” Smail said.
All parties seem to agree that the Conowingo agreement will serve as a model for how states and citizen groups can shape federal relicensing decisions. Isaacson said the deal sets a precedent in its use of the Clean Water Act to address emerging challenges like sediment scouring due to more frequent extreme storms.
“There will be a lot of major hydroelectric projects coming up for relicensing in the coming years and many of them may share similar issues,” he said. “We secured a major victory here, but there’s no doubt it took a lot of persistence.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7706-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-13 06:56:19.039528

A handful of Pennsylvania counties mistakenly issued duplicate mail ballots to a few of their voters in recent weeks. 
Why that happened is unclear — state and county officials gave different explanations — but they cautioned that the error would have not resulted in anyone being able to have their vote counted twice.
State and county officials said they have found that a total of 68 potential duplicate mail ballots were mistakenly issued. In some of these cases, they said, the ballots may not have reached voters, as the mistake may have been caught after a second ballot label was generated but before a duplicate ballot was actually mailed to the voter. 
In Luzerne County, in northeast Pennsylvania, 31 voters received duplicate mail ballots, WVIA reported Tuesday. State officials initially said that the problem was isolated to that one county, but acknowledged a small number of other counties experienced similar issues — although potentially for different reasons — after inquiries from Votebeat and Spotlight PA. 
Using publicly available information on mail ballot requests, Votebeat and Spotlight PA identified a few other counties that appeared to have issued duplicate ballots. Election officials in Dauphin, Montgomery, and Carbon counties confirmed that some voters in their counties had been issued or received duplicate mail ballots as well. 
Emily Cook, election director for Luzerne County, told WVIA that the cause was an unknown problem with the state election management system, known as SURE. 
But Jonathan Marks, deputy secretary of the commonwealth, said the duplicate labels were created in a variety of ways, and at least some stemmed from user error as counties tried to fix an issue with the first mail ballot. SURE’s user interface has shortcomings, he acknowledged, and resolving one issue can create another if counties don’t use the ideal method. Marks said the state is looking at how to improve it.
The Department of State said counties sometimes print duplicate labels for other reasons, such as damage to the original label. “A duplicate label’s existence does not automatically mean an error has occurred,” the department said in a statement. 
Both county and state officials stressed that the duplicate ballots have been canceled, and could not be cast or counted. In addition, each ballot return envelope has a unique barcode associated with the voter. When a county receives a ballot back, the code is scanned into the SURE system and it marks the voter as having voted. If a second barcode tied to the same voter were to be scanned, the system would reject the ballot. 
After learning of the duplicate mail ballots in Luzerne, state election officials audited the SURE system to check for any additional duplicates, and found 37 potential cases across seven other counties. 
In Dauphin County, which includes Harrisburg, Election Director Chris Spackman said the county was informed by the department on Tuesday that “a routine internal review of the SURE system” had discovered a single duplicate ballot sent to a Dauphin voter. Spackman added that his deputy was informed by a contractor who helps the department manage the SURE system that the error was the contractor’s, but he knew no other details. 
Megan Alt, a spokesperson for Montgomery County, west of Philadelphia, said the county had notified the state Wednesday morning of a potential duplicate, and workers subsequently discovered three other voters who had received duplicate ballots “as a result of files received from the state’s system.”
Carbon County’s election director, Jennifer Ketchledge, confirmed that her county issued 20 duplicate labels for mail voters. She said the department reached out to her Tuesday and informed her, and the county canceled the additional ballots.
“I have no clue” why it happened, she said, adding that the state was looking into it. 
Even if two mailing labels for ballots are generated for the same voter, Ketchledge said the vendor that handles the county’s mail ballot printing and shipping would catch it before the duplicate ballot was actually sent. 
Cook, the Luzerne election director, did not respond to a request for comment, but county officials told other news outlets the SURE system shouldn’t allow such errors to happen. 
“Assuming that the state’s excuse is accurate, how broken is the SURE system if it cannot safeguard against a county inadvertently sending two labels for the same voter?” Luzerne County Manager Romilda Crocamo told The Citizen’s Voice Wednesday.
“There is nothing sure about the SURE system,” Crocamo added. “The upgrades to SURE system can’t happen soon enough.”
The state said the SURE system’s primary safeguard “is a mechanism that prevents recording more than one ballot per voter in a single election.”

(Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence)PENNINGTON GAP, Va. — On a Saturday evening in June, people of this rural region gathered at the historic Lee Theatre to celebrate the founding of Higher Ground Women’s Recovery Residence.
Author Barbara Kingsolver opened the facility in January with royalties from her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Demon Copperhead,” whose plot revolves around Appalachia’s opioid crisis. The home offers a supportive place for people to stay while learning to live without drugs. Kingsolver had asked the women now living there to join her on stage.

Kingsolver, who grew up on the edge of Appalachia in Kentucky’s Nicholas County, suggested the women share with the audience what they were most proud of having gained from their first weeks at Higher Ground. But she learned they were more eager to brag on one another.
Supporters say Higher Ground provides stability and a reentry point after leaving jail, prison, or a treatment center. It offers a range of services and support in an area devastated by addiction to painkilling pills and other types of opioids. Most fundamentally, it’s a true home, with one- and two-person bedrooms, a communal kitchen, and a den. Residents say they have found affirmation from a cohort of women who understand how addiction can demoralize a person and estrange them from family and community.
Ronda Morgan, a resident, said her family has always been in her corner. But while she was serving a jail sentence for drug possession, she told herself, “I’m sick of them having to do time with me.” She was ready for recovery. Her daughter, who’s a nurse, told her about Higher Ground, the first facility of its kind in sprawling, rural Lee County. Morgan learned she could live there for up to two years to gain the footing that had eluded her in three-plus decades of addiction.
What she didn’t anticipate was the kinship she forged with her housemates — among them, Syara Parsell — and with Higher Ground’s staff.
Parsell, 35, one of Higher Ground’s first residents, said that in her time there she’s received help finding employment and enrolling in community college courses.
From the staff and Kingsolver, Parsell said, she has received judgment-free support. “Together,” she said, “we figure it out.”
Traditional treatment facilities typically operate under highly structured medical supervision. Recovery houses, like Higher Ground, offer a more relaxed environment, helping move a resident “toward being an independent, fully functional, self-reliant human being,” said Marvin Ventrell, CEO of the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.
“Recovery occurs in the community,” he said. But reentry must be approached delicately. “When addiction occurs with a human being, it also occurs within a family social structure.” If a person in early recovery returns to a family that’s unprepared, that person’s chances of success “are severely diminished.”
For Kingsolver, the opioid crisis became a focal point for what she hoped would be “the great Appalachian novel.” The epidemic “has changed so much of the texture of this place,” devastating families and communities.
Pharmaceutical companies targeted central Appalachia for sales of what they falsely claimed were addiction-resistant prescription opioids. Kingsolver wanted to “cast my net back over all of the extractive industries that have come to this place, taken out what was good, and left behind a mess.”
“The way I put it is, ‘They came to harvest our pain when there was nothing else left,’” she said.

In research for “Demon Copperhead,” she immersed herself in the stories of people who’ve navigated addiction and those who care and advocate for them.
The novel has been an enormous success, having sold more than 3 million copies and earning far more than her previous works. Kingsolver decided to dedicate hundreds of thousands of dollars to address the crisis that has overwhelmed the region where she was raised — and to which she returned full time in 2004.
Again, she set about listening. Drawing on a wide range of expertise, she determined that a women’s recovery home was the wisest investment.
Joie Cantrell works as a public health nurse in harm reduction for the Virginia Department of Health, supporting policies and practices to curb the negative effects of drug use, and serves as Higher Ground’s board chair. She had long recognized the need for just such a home.
“That was the part that was missing,” Cantrell said. Too often, when someone would come out of a treatment facility or incarceration, “we lost them. They fell back into the same old patterns.” She said the region sorely needed a safe, stable environment where women could recalibrate.
By August, the home reached its capacity of seven women. It’s right in town, “which is so important,” Kingsolver said, “because in this part of the country we have no public transportation.”
Parsell has long suffered from social anxieties; drugs were her escape. Here, her housemates embraced her. They’ve offered the support she’d never experienced.
“Every two seconds, someone’s like, ‘Syara’s here!’” she said. “I’m very grateful for it.” If there’s an issue in the house, “one of the seven of us has the solution.”
Four residents are employed outside the home, one is enrolled in community college classes, one is completing her GED with plans to continue her education, and everyone volunteers in the community. Crafting classes are offered. Family members visit.
“They’re living life,” said Subrenda Huff, who was filling in while director Liz Brooks took maternity leave.

Morgan said she accomplished more in a month at Higher Ground than she had in years. That includes applying for identification documents, taking budgeting classes, and seeking permanent housing. It includes sharing upkeep duties in the house.
Such was Kingsolver’s vision. But, she said, “here’s what I didn’t expect: The community embraced this with loving arms. I thought maybe people would say, ‘I don’t want this in my backyard.’”
Most of the furniture was donated. Kingsolver’s quarter-million or so social media followers have been instrumental in that. “But it’s not just book clubs in Switzerland or in California; it’s people in Pennington Gap,” she said. Church groups have donated “quilts, bedside lamps, things to hang on the walls just to make it homey.”
Before the facility opened, local folks volunteered to pull weeds, take down an old fence, and put up a new one. Kingsolver said the well of support “has been just endless. It’s been deep, and loving, and a wonder to see.”
Higher Ground, with only one paid staff member, has estimated yearly operating costs of $120,000, Cantrell said. Residents are charged $50 a week. Ventrell said that fees at other recovery houses vary widely but that $2,500 a month is an approximate average.
“We want them to focus on saving money and paying any restitution or fines they may have from past charges,” Cantrell said. “Some may be focused on repaying child support they may owe.”
Higher Ground receives no federal or state funding. Donations continue to pour in. And Kingsolver recently bought the building next door with plans to open a thrift shop, which would be a source of additional income for the home and offer retail work experience for its residents.
Supporters aspire to open more Higher Ground homes elsewhere in the region.
What these women are gaining, Kingsolver said, “is not just sobriety, but belief in themselves.”

Over the past few months, after municipal employees have clocked out, their work computers have stayed on for a little self-improvement — specifically, overnight updates pushed by the city’s IT team to install Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system (OS).
It’s all to outrun the Tuesday, Oct. 14, deadline, when Windows 10 will reach its “end of support.” After that, computers all over the globe that still run Windows 10 will cease receiving “technical assistance, feature updates and security updates,” in Microsoft’s words. For government IT departments, it’s not an option to run fleets of computers sans the latest security tweaks, especially since they’re connected to a city’s most vital functions.
To stay secure, Microsoft recommends upgrading machines to Windows 11. Because of hardware limitations, many cannot. The other options are to pay Microsoft for extended security updates, or to leave the machines in the past and hope for the best. 
Budget documents from the past two years show scattered evidence of local government officials scrambling to address the changeover to Windows 11.
The Community College of Rhode Island asked for $1.17 million in its fiscal year 2025 budget request to replace faculty and staff laptops and PCs which couldn’t be upgraded. The Rhode Island Office of the Public Defender noted in its fiscal year 2026 budget request that its technology ask was 7.38% higher than for 2025 partially because it needed Windows 11-compatible replacements. A March 2024 budget presentation in Jamestown suggested the island town needed $33,600 to swap out its old computers which couldn’t run Windows 11.
The Rhode Island Ethics Commission also received an additional $97,443 in its tech coffer for fiscal year 2025, but the quasi-public agency’s executive director Jason Gramitt wrote in an Oct. 9 email that most of that money went toward a new case management system. The new Windows 11 workstations only cost $8,179 in comparison, Gramitt wrote. 
Pawtucket has largely avoided these expensive options as most of its existing PCs could be upgraded “in place,” said Hersh Cristino, Pawtucket’s chief information and innovation officer, in a recent phone interview. The few machines which couldn’t join the future could be repurposed as “not mission critical” hardware, he added.
“You know, like, ‘Oh yeah, I’m doing a training. Somebody needs to grab a laptop,’” Cristino said. 
Governments have less flexibility than private industry when it comes to big upgrades, Cristino said. He sketched a hypothetical scenario: “You’re in the middle of taking a tax payment, and then you need to upgrade the person’s machine. ‘Oh, sorry. Come back in an hour.’” 
“The challenge is always downtime,” Cristino said, which is why Pawtucket’s IT team — which manage the city’s municipal computers as well those in its school district —  have used the nighttime to minimize possible annoyance for non-IT staff. The upgrade process involves creating a configuration profile with Windows 11, which is then deployed and loaded onto PCs in small batches nightly. Each upgrade usually takes a little over an hour, Cristino said, and the refreshed machines are ready for city workers when they return in the morning. 
Cristino, who took over the city’s IT department in 2012, said the upgrade process this time around has been gentle on installers and users alike. When it comes to mass upgrades, problems can arise “any time you move somebody’s cheese,” Cristino said. Staff can be disoriented by the sudden changes that updates can bring to their work PCs, like relocated taskbars or different menus. 
But the Windows 11 rollout is not as dramatic as transitions in the past: “It’s one of those kinds of upgrades where you look, and you don’t even notice for the most part that you’ve upgraded,” Cristino said. 
Phillip Carlucci, the IT director in Warwick, is likewise unfazed by the upgrade process in his city hall. 
“Just another technology project,” Carlucci wrote in an email. “Fairly routine.”
About 500 Warwick machines were still running Windows 10 at the end of September, but Carlucci was confident the process would be finished by the deadline.

Long lead time to prepare
The deadline to upgrade was no surprise. Windows 10 hit the market in July 2015 and, like most versions of Microsoft’s iconic OS, it became a mainstay of homes, businesses and governments. But the end was officially nigh when, in April 2023, Microsoft announced Windows 10’s end of support.Windows 11 was released in October 2021 and only overtook Windows 10 in popularity in March 2025, according to StatCounter, a website which estimates market share and OS usage through web browser-collected data.
Upgrading to Windows 11 is free on compatible machines, so a tech budget won’t need to stretch much to accommodate Windows 11 if a town or agency’s computers are relatively modern. \
But unlike its older siblings, Windows 11 is pickier about its playmates. It will only install and run on a machine that fulfills a heavier slate of security requirements related to its processor, firmware, and the inclusion of something called the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0, which is typically a hardware chip installed on a computer’s motherboard. Many older machines lack this chip and it is usually unfeasible or outright impossible to add one.
Jim Silveria, Providence’s director of Information Technology, said in a recent phone interview that after about a year and a half of upgrades, the capital city’s move to Windows 11 was “99% complete.” The city was able to allocate some of its American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds before they evaporated to help the Windows 11 transition, Silveria said. 
Any machines not able to be upgraded by Tuesday’s cutoff — “stragglers,” Silveria called them — would be severed from the city’s network. Sometimes, peripherals or specific software used by governments can further complicate the process, as software vendors may not have updated certain programs in a long time, leaving them incompatible with Windows 11. In Providence, one of the machines that may have its internet privileges revoked is a receipt printer used in the Recorder of Deeds’ office.
“It’s been in use for at least 10 years,” Silveria said. “We weren’t able to find a driver.”
So far, so good
The upgrade process has gone relatively smoothly in Rhode Island — at least according to IT officials willing to be interviewed by Rhode Island Current. 
Cranston finished its upgrade in about three months, swapping out any computers that couldn’t make the move upward, according to city spokesperson Zack DeLuca. Bristol Municipal Operations Manager Eric Dickervitz wrote in a recent email that the town had no more devices on Windows 10, as it “routinely upgrade[s]” its equipment. 
Even a small town like New Shoreham, the sole municipality on Block Island, is feeling ready. The town lacks a dedicated in-house IT team and uses a managed service provider, Town Manager Amy Land said in a recent email. “The town doesn’t have any concerns about the Windows 10 end of life,” Land said.

But a number of municipalities did not respond to multiple requests for interviews from Rhode Island Current. Two municipalities — East Providence and Middletown — did respond but without specifics. 
“The Town of Middletown and its School Department have been well aware of the upcoming situation with Windows 10 and have a solid plan in place that we believe will address the transition without any interruptions to our staff, residents and businesspeople,” Matt Sheley, a town spokesperson, wrote over email.
East Providence spokesperson Matthew Paddock, meanwhile, wrote, “The City of East Providence is currently in the process of updating our operating systems to Windows 11, maintaining industry standard.”
At the state level, as of Oct. 2, only 27 computers still needed upgrades. The process moved quickly, as evidenced by an earlier count from Aug. 20 which counted 1,247 computers in need of upgrades.
Brian Tardiff, Rhode Island’s chief information officer and head of the Division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services (ETSS), said the state handled procurement centrally and purchased about 4,620 new devices to replace machines that couldn’t run Windows 11, an investment totalling about $3.4 million. 
No grants or federal funds were used for these purchases, and anything that didn’t need to be replaced was upgraded in place. The Windows 11 upgrades even got a shoutout from Gov. Dan McKee in his fiscal year 2025 budget, which allocated $4.8 million from the Information Processing Internal Service Fund for IT-related expenses.

Consumers have limited options
While governments have little choice in whether to upgrade, consumers are on their own. They can also squeeze a little more life out of their Windows 10 machines with Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates.
In an unsigned Oct. 9 email, a Microsoft spokesperson called these updates a “short-term bridge” while people move to Windows 11. Customers can get the extended updates for a year if they sync their PC settings with the company’s cloud service, Windows Backup, or if they redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points. The coverage will run from Oct. 15, 2025, to Oct. 13, 2026. 
Customers can also pay $30 for the extended support. For cities, schools and other organizations, Microsoft will charge $61 per device for the first year of extended updates. The updates can be renewed for up to three years, with price increases each year. 
On Sept. 25, Microsoft budged slightly and decided to allow consumers in the European Economic Area to receive a free year’s worth of extended updates for Windows 10, no backup required.
The push to charge U.S. consumers for continued, secure access to otherwise functional computers they own is problematic for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), an environment-focused consumer advocacy nonprofit with local affiliates in multiple states, including Rhode Island. PIRG recently estimated that roughly 40% of current Windows 10 devices won’t be able to upgrade globally. That could eventually generate 1.6 billion pounds of e-waste, in the group’s estimate. 
“We just think this is absurd from a consumer point of view,” Henry Welch, a campaign associate with PIRG’s Right to Repair, said. Welch works on PIRG campaigns primarily in Rhode Island and Maine. “We’re especially worried about the effect that the end of Windows 10 would have on consumers and the environment in general.”
The options available to Windows 10 consumers are all suboptimal, in PIRG’s view. The tough choices will largely fall upon people already using more affordable devices, PIRG says, as they might not be able to acquire new machines. 
“It’s totally possible for them to extend security updates for at least a year,” Welch said. “I mean, they’re doing it in Europe already.”
PIRG is pressing Microsoft to do the same in the U.S. The group sent a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella with 590 signatories asking Microsoft to do so. While PIRG will not release the list publicly, the advocacy organization said the list includes Rhode Island signees, including James Frame, owner of South County Computers in Wakefield, who commented on the Windows 11 transition in a PIRG press release. 
“We were regularly installing it [Windows 10] on customers’ computers until less than a year ago, as we considered it more stable and tried-and-true than Windows 11,” Frame said. “If it ain’t broke, don’t outdate it.”
Welch said that when he’s campaigned in rural parts of Maine, he’s encountered many people “running, really, really older versions of Windows on older laptops.”  The “very steep hardware upgrades” needed for Windows 11 like the TPM 2.0 are part of how innovation “is leaving some of these less technologically savvy people behind,” Welch said.

Pawtucket’s Cristino said his city may purchase a handful of extended support updates for Windows 10 PCs that can’t make the move.
“You never know if Microsoft next week is gonna say, ‘Yeah, no, we’re gonna extend [the deadline] a little longer,” Cristino joked.
But Microsoft will not: “After October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide security and feature updates or technical support for Windows 10,” the company’s spokesperson wrote to Rhode Island Current on Oct. 9 in an unsigned email.
The spokesperson steered customers toward trade-in and recycling programs through Microsoft and its partners for devices that can’t be upgraded, and noted the company’s goal of “becoming carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030.” 
But PIRG predicts the waste will multiply. In its letter to Microsoft’s Nadella , the group argued, “The end of free Windows 10 support will cause widespread damage to the environment and cybersecurity,” with “hundreds of millions of devices” destined for either obsolescence or the landfill.
In the Ocean State, those items may end up with the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC), which runs the state’s Central Landfill in Johnston and also serves as a collection site for the state’s e-waste program. In 2024, the Johnston e-waste collection site logged 84,517 pounds of covered electronics, all of it destined for manufacturer-funded recycling programs. 



Do I need to upgrade my operating system?
Why should I upgrade from Windows 10 anyway? Because of their ubiquity, Windows systems have long been the biggest target for malware and other bad actors. Most malicious scripts are written for Windows, and years of backwards compatibility and the wide array of apps and drivers on Windows widen the possibilities for attack. Improvements like TPM — or Trusted Platform Module, which ensures when a system starts up that it hasn’t been tampered with — harden Windows against bad actors, but cyberthreats develop almost in lockstep with security measures. 
“Microsoft understands that moving to a new PC can take time, and there are multiple options to choose from,” the company recommended through a spokesperson. “For devices that are eligible to upgrade to Windows 11, they strongly encourage the upgrade as this will give the  highest security for the device.”

First, check to see if your Windows PC can upgrade: The PC Health Check App can quickly identify whether your Windows computer needs an upgrade. If you’re curious about the specs, Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0, UEFI/Secure Boot, and a modern CPU and RAM. If your computer was made in the last five years, it probably qualifies. You may need to turn on TPM 2.0.
If you can’t upgrade and need more time: You can enroll in Windows’ Extended Support Updates. Coverage will run from Oct. 15, 2025, to Oct. 13, 2026. To continue receiving updates, your options include:

Syncing your PC settings with Microsoft’s cloud service, Windows Backup, at no additional cost
Redeeming 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points
Paying $30, plus any additional taxes.

Microsoft 365 Apps get a longer runway: Desktop apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, and Publisher will get security updates on Windows 10 until Oct. 10, 2028, but the underlying OS won’t, so plan accordingly. 
I bought a new PC. What do I do with my old one? The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation website includes plenty of information, broken down by municipality, on how to recycle old computers. Microsoft also recommends trade-in and recycling programs are available through through its trusted partners, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, or at retailers like Best Buy and Walmart. Business customers can access similar services through resellers like Bechtle, CDW, ComputaCenter, Connection, and SHI, Microsoft said.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in Chiles v. Salazar, a case that could significantly change how states protect LGBTQIA+ youth. The issue is whether states can ban licensed mental health professionals from subjecting children to so-called “conversion therapy.”
From the questioning, most justices seem ready to strike down these bans, arguing that conversion therapists are simply engaging in protected speech with their clients.
That framing is dangerously incomplete. Licensed professionals such as therapists, doctors and lawyers are not ordinary speakers. When we earn a professional license, we also accept restrictions on our speech during practice. These restrictions exist for a reason: Words can cause serious harm when spoken with professional authority.
Supreme Court justices skeptical of free speech limits in Colorado conversion therapy case

If a doctor advises a patient to drink bleach to cure a cold, or a lawyer counsels a client to commit perjury, neither can hide behind the First Amendment. Professional speech is held to standards of competence and ethics because the stakes involve life, liberty and health.
The same holds true in mental health practice. Conversion therapy is not a harmless exchange of ideas between equals. It is based on the discredited belief that LGBTQIA+ identities are disorders to be fixed. All major medical and mental health organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have condemned conversion therapy as ineffective, unethical and harmful. These groups warn that the practice raises the risks of depression, substance abuse, family rejection and suicide. Conversion therapy is a form of psychological abuse, particularly when forced upon minors.
State regulation of professional practice is well established. States regularly define limits on what licensed professionals can and cannot do. We prevent doctors from prescribing unsafe or unproven treatments. We discipline lawyers who provide fraudulent or harmful advice.
Therapists are also required to follow standards that mandate evidence-based practices and prioritize client safety. Conversion therapy fails these standards, and states have both the right and obligation to protect children from it.
The court’s apparent willingness to prioritize the free speech rights of practitioners over the health and safety of minors overlooks that balance. The First Amendment has never been an absolute shield against professional responsibility. Treating it as such would lead to a cascade of unintended consequences. If speech alone were the standard, what would prevent a financial advisor from selling fraudulent schemes under the guise of “speech?” What would stop a physician from prescribing quack remedies with no scientific backing? Regulation of professions has always required more than blind deference to free expression.
The consequences of overturning these bans will be severe. Children themselves rarely seek conversion therapy. It is imposed on them by parents or guardians, often influenced by religious or ideological groups. These young people do not give informed consent before attending therapy. They are forced into sessions that promote shame and self-hatred. 
Research indicates that LGBTQIA+ young adults who faced high levels of family rejection are more than eight times as likely to attempt suicide compared to their peers from supportive families. Loosening state bans now would risk exploitation by professionals under the guise of constitutional liberty.
The court should avoid oversimplifying this issue as merely a conflict between free speech and censorship. The case involves professional standards, public safety, and the legitimate role of the state in preventing harm. Personal opinions belong in the public square where disagreement is protected. However, when a licensed professional advises a client, that speech is not just free expression but professional conduct with ethical duties and legal limits. Ignoring this distinction risks enabling harm and diminishes the authority of states to protect vulnerable youth.
The First Amendment deserves robust protection, but not at the expense of children’s lives. The Constitution should not be distorted into a weapon that protects malpractice.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpeg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)Six years after they first squared off, Republican Del. Carrie Coyner and Democrat Lindsey Dougherty are headed for a high-stakes rematch in Virginia’s House District 75 — a once-reliably Republican seat that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and has since become one of the most closely watched battlegrounds statewide.
Coyner, a Chesterfield attorney and former school board member who won the newly drawn district by about five points in 2023, spent the last week fielding national attention tied to 2022 text messages from Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones — messages Jones sent to Coyner and later apologized for after they became public this month.
 

Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41



The episode rippled through Virginia’s statewide races and thrust Coyner, usually known for K-12 policy and housing wonkery, into a national storyline.
Dougherty, a senior research administrator at Virginia Commonwealth University and the 2019 Democratic nominee in the area’s previous configuration, is pitching herself as a kitchen-table problem solver focused on health care affordability, special education, and mental-health access — themes she says cut across Hopewell, Prince George and Chesterfield alike.
Today’s District 75 stitches together the city of Hopewell with portions of Chesterfield and Prince George counties. After the Supreme Court of Virginia redrew legislative maps in 2021, the seat’s electorate diversified and trended younger, and Democrats made gains. In 2024, Harris carried the district 52.3% to 46.2% for Republican Donald Trump, part of a broader blue swing in Chesterfield that helped make suburban seats more competitive.
Money underscores the stakes. Through late summer, the Virginia Public Access Project lists Coyner with roughly $846,580 raised this cycle and Dougherty with about $490,902.
 Carrie Coyner

A self-described education realist who came up through the Chesterfield School Board, Coyner says her legislative compass hasn’t changed since she first ran.
“My passion for public education has stayed at the forefront of all of my public service,” she told The Mercury in a recent interview. “I originally got into public service on the school board, because I was passionate about improving the quality of education for every child, regardless of your zip code.”
On committee work, she argues Education, General Laws (Housing Subcommittee) and Appropriations are where she delivers for her district.
“Sitting on (the) education committee, (I can) be a voice about keeping us focused on our primary role, which is providing the highest quality education to kids,” she said. 
She also called herself “the lead voice on housing policies,” using 25 years in real estate law to flag well-intended bills with “unintended bad consequences.” 
In Appropriations, she said much of the work is “ahead of time behind the scenes,” adjusting proposals before costs cascade.
Coyner has been a principal architect for the Virginia Literacy Act and follow-on measures. The 2022 law shifted Virginia toward science-of-reading instruction, funded reading specialists and directed the state to support district rollouts. 
In 2024, lawmakers approved a Coyner bill tightening VLA provisions and barring three-cueing in reading curricula. “We learned from (other states) how to do it better,” she said, arguing the full benefits will phase in over several years.
Coyner also pointed to special-education work, including professional development requirements for general-education teachers working with students with disabilities, and criticized Democrats for not fully funding training “at one time.” 
On teacher retention, she opposed extending year-long substitute assignments, saying they heap burden on veteran staff; she favors recruiting retirees part-time and offering tuition assistance to math and science majors who agree to teach. 
She further touted a new guarantee that high-school students can take “passport” dual-enrollment courses for free — in person or via community colleges — to lower costs and ease staffing gaps.
Housing is Coyner’s second plank. In the interview, the Republican said she is planning to refile a proposal to create an emergency fund serving “up to 5,000 families with school-age children” to prevent displacement during the school year. “It improves educational outcomes,” she said, by keeping kids in stable classrooms. 
And on the development front, she argues a better environmental balance is possible — newer subdivisions built to modern storm-water rules shouldn’t mean clear-cut neighborhoods, and “affordable” must be understood as a sliding scale across incomes to avoid concentrating poverty.
Industrial permitting and public health remain sensitive around Hopewell, which includes 16,000 registered voters — roughly 27% of all the voters in the district. 
Coyner called manufacturing “the backbone” of the local economy — her grandparents worked in it — but stressed air and water protections and regular talks with DEQ. When the Hopewell wastewater plant spilled sewage into the James River this summer, Coyner said she “immediately got involved” in understanding what failed and how to prevent a repeat. The district is also watching an air-permit fight involving the AdvanSix chemical facility, a case that has drawn environmental-group petitions and federal review.
On abortion, with a constitutional amendment advancing on first reference this year, Coyner frames Democrats’ proposal as overly broad.
“If you look at what has been brought forward, it is the most expansive abortion bill ever brought anywhere, period,” she said, adding she hasn’t met voters backing policies like abortions “up until the moment of birth” or minors’ access “without … talk[ing] to their parents.”
The proposed constitutional amendment’s language does not draw a precise “week-limit” cut-off. Rather, it authorizes the state to regulate abortions in the third trimester only under conditions that preserve exceptions when medically necessary or when viability is lacking.
Democrats counter that their measure would largely codify existing law, protect contraception, miscarriage care and IVF, and update later-term standards under medical necessity — a fight expected to return next session before any ballot question goes to voters.
On public safety, Coyner highlighted a partnership she helped broker with the nonprofit Real Life and local police to dispatch outreach teams after shootings, defuse retaliation and connect neighbors with services. She said it has cut “gang and group-related violence” significantly, with a domestic-violence prevention push next.
Politically, Coyner’s bottom-line contrast is simple.
“For my district, I’ve got results,” she said. “My policies try to get government out of your life when you don’t need it, and to keep more money in your pockets.”
She declined hypotheticals about losing: “I’m choosing not to think that’s a possibility.”
 Lindsey Dougherty

The Democrat’s pitch starts with her résumé and her household budget. A VCU senior research administrator who manages NIH and NSF grants, Dougherty said federal turbulence affects families like hers directly.
“This is not the first, but the second time that this president’s kind of chaotic approach to governing is directly impacting my ability to provide for my family,” she said in a recent interview, recalling a COVID-era furlough from a Chesterfield County budget job in 2020. 
“Across my district, we have a lot of federally funded workers. There’s just a lot of fear and uncertainty about how families are going to survive.”
Her “north star” as a would-be lawmaker, she said, is health care accessibility and affordability. Both of her children have complex autoimmune disorders, and she described long waits for specialists followed by stress over the bills.
“Similar to what was done in 2020 to cap the cost of insulin in Virginia, we can look at other ways to cap prescription drug costs for life-giving medications,” Dougherty said. She’d lean on state insurance regulators and her budgeting background to prioritize relief in the state plan.
On mental health, Dougherty points to school-based care, homeless services and better coordination among agencies using state and federal dollars. She called the shortage of crisis beds and strain on local systems “fixable with focus,” but said the state must avoid passing along unfunded mandates.
Workforce and higher-ed access are another priority. Dougherty wants to expand pathways through community colleges and skilled-trades programs so “good-paying jobs” don’t require a four-year degree.
“We have this really great community college system that we can tap into,” she said, arguing programs should match local employers so graduates “are able to stay in the communities that they live in.”
On K-12, she speaks as a parent who fought for proper Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). 
“It took me years to get my son an IEP at all,” she said, then “an additional year and a half” to secure needed accommodations. She wants staffing boosted and the state funding formula updated — particularly for rural divisions and special education — to ease overcrowding and burnout.
Housing is where Dougherty draws a sharp contrast with her opponent, favoring stronger tenant protections and state help for first-time buyers while urging localities to diversify housing types.
“I firmly believe that we need to provide tenant rights in addition to landlord rights,” she said, adding that Chesterfield “pretty much only (builds) large houses right now” while seniors and young families need attainable options. She links affordability to wages and child-care costs: “We really just need to look at everything holistically.”
On environmental health, Dougherty says Hopewell has been “disproportionately impacted” by industry and that fines alone aren’t sufficient deterrents when air or water permits are violated. She pointed to sewage spills and air-permit disputes as reasons to pair job retention with tougher monitoring and enforcement.
“There’s no reason why we can’t find a middle ground that works for everybody,” she said.
The debate echoes a controversy unfolding in the district, where Dominion Energy’s proposal for a new natural gas–fired plant in Chesterfield has drawn sharp opposition from environmental groups and residents concerned about pollution and public health, while business leaders and some local officials defend it as vital for grid reliability and job creation. 
The project, now under state review, has become a flashpoint in Virginia’s broader struggle to balance industrial growth with climate and air-quality goals.
Dougherty also backs “commonsense gun safety,” including limits on assault-style firearms and location rules for dealers near schools.
“I’m not against the Second Amendment,” she said, “but when we have our kids dying at a disproportionate rate, we need to look at ways to just keep our communities safer.”
On the reproductive rights amendment, Dougherty said she supports enshrining protections in the constitution and frames it as clarity and stability for families and providers.
Politically, she argues the felt difference will be in day-to-day costs:
“There are very tangible ways that the General Assembly can positively impact people’s lives every day,” she said. “If I’m going to pick one key piece, it’s the affordability and accessibility of health care.”
Dougherty also jabbed Coyner’s record as too aligned with GOP leadership, saying “she shows up to community events” but doesn’t vote for the district’s needs in Richmond. Her own strategy to overcome incumbency reprises 2019 and includes relentless door-knocking, coalition building and telling her family’s story to Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.
In District 75, the map, money and mood suggest a fall race decided at the margins — a test of whether Harris-district math and Democratic energy can out-organize an incumbent with a record on education policy and deep community ties. 
What’s certain is that voters in this district will hear sharply different emphases on schools, health care and housing — and conflicting diagnoses of what “affordability” means in a fast-changing suburban-industrial district along the James.

RICHMOND, Va. — Northampton and Accomack counties launched a new program in late August that will help public high school students prepare for a career in the aerospace industry.
The Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore Lab School will provide students with networking skills, portfolio development, and experiential learning opportunities as they engage in regional aerospace initiatives.
Eastern Shore Community College and Old Dominion University are the higher education partners. Chincoteague, Northampton, Arcadia and Nandua high schools are the K-12 partners.
Students can participate all four years of high school. Freshmen and sophomores take cyber, engineering and computer science classes at the high schools, and juniors and seniors take courses at ESCC.
Once the students become juniors and seniors, the program provides two options for students. Students who take the Aerospace Engineering and Explorations route will earn an associate degree and those who pursue Aerospace Technology will receive a technician certificate.
Students will also learn about engineering fundamentals, entrepreneurship and computer science skills, in addition to gaining college math and English credits. Community college students will also have the opportunity to take aerospace courses.
“It’s a very exciting opportunity for not just the students that get to experience it, but the schools and the community around it,” said Rachel White, Aerospace Academy of the Eastern Shore program executive director.
Virginia students are chosen by a lottery system because of legislation the state approved, according to White. The first 50 students that enter into the lottery get accepted. Extra students are added to the waitlist and their acceptance is determined by the date and time they apply. AAES will add more students to the program in January 2026 if spots are available.
The academy is at the right location, according to White. NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility is on the Eastern Shore and hosts the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and the new Rocket Lab Launch Complex.

“It’s such a booming area, and the school divisions creating a pipeline for students to be able to just directly go into the field, I think, is ideal,” White said.
The launch of the academy is an incredible opportunity for Virginia, according to Gary Skeen, associate director for the Center of Education Innovation and Opportunity at Old Dominion University.
“Really Old Dominion University is creating a full K-12 STEM pipeline and really trying to position ourselves as the STEM capital of the East Coast,” Skeen said.
ODU has four college partnership lab schools and are fiscal partners with five more, according to Skeen. Faculty members help train and write the curriculums.
“The space industry is currently at a point where it’s really growing,” Skeen said. “It’s really becoming a moving part of the economy across the nation.”
Although the aerospace workforce is slated to grow in coming years, federal cuts have impacted NASA. Over 2,100 senior ranking staff employees agreed to leave NASA through federal administration efforts to trim the federal workforce, according to a July Politico report. NASA currently employs almost 18,000 civil servants, according to its website.
“We need many students pursuing careers in the aerospace industry,” said Karen Sanzo, executive director for the ODU Center of Education Innovation and Opportunity. “I think in Virginia, it is going to be a thriving industry.”
Students participating in the academy will have the chance to complete a Virginia Community College System passport program, which is a set of course blocks designed to satisfy lower-division general education requirements at state public colleges and universities.
The program opens a gateway to the future, Gov. Glenn Youngkin stated in a press release.
“These students will be immersed in Virginia’s aerospace sector and launch into careers that will shape the skies and beyond,” Youngkin stated. “Our mission since day one has been not only to prepare students for the future, but to empower them to lead it.”

(Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images)Ohio reproductive rights providers and advocates are keeping an eye on federal discussions about a longtime FDA-approved drug used in medication abortion, while maintaining a resolute message in a state with constitutional protections for abortion.
The head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has indicated he wants the federal Food and Drug Administration to re-review pills used in abortion procedures for safety and effectiveness.
Mifepristone has been FDA-approved since September 2000, and the first generic version was approved in April 2019. Just last month, the FDA approved another generic form of the medication.
Patricia Zettler, a law professor at Ohio State University who studies the FDA, said the request for a new review seems unusual, and it’s also unusual considering drug companies including those that make mifepristone are required to participate in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program, which the FDA uses to “help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.”
According to the FDA, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for mifepristone require that the drug be prescribed by a qualified health care provider, that the patient sign a patient agreement form explaining the risks of the treatment and that the drug be distributed by a certified pharmacy.
“The mifepristone REMS programs is a closed system, meaning prescribers, pharmacies and distributors are certified or authorized and verified under the REMS prior to distribution or dispensing of the drug,” according to the FDA.
But Zettler said because of abortion rights (and anti-abortion rights) movements in individual states and moves like HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s to ask for renewed scrutiny, the drug has been “getting a lot of attention.”
“Policy preferences are generally not permissible when we’re talking about drug approval,” Zettler said.

Medication abortion is typically done with a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol.
It has often been a choice for those without easy access to reproductive clinics or without reliable transportation to get to an appointment.
It’s also considered a less-invasive alternative to surgical abortion.
The newest annual abortion report from the Ohio Department of Health showed medication abortions were used in more than 13,000 abortions in the state, representing more than 46% of all reported abortions in 2024.
A total of 196 post-abortion complications were reported in the 21,829 abortions conducted in Ohio, according to state data.
No deaths were reported in 2024.
In testimony before an Ohio House committee discussing a bill related to abortion funding, Ohio State epidemiology professor Dr. Alison Norris, spoke on the effectiveness of the drug.
Norris is also a co-principal investigator for the Ohio Policy Evaluation Network, a group of academic researchers who study abortion and contraception developments and impacts.
Norris told legislators during the committee hearing that more than 100 peer-reviewed studies over 25 years “create a strong scientific evidence-base to show mifepristone is safe.”
“Scientific consensus is that serious adverse events amongst users of Mifepristone occur less than 0.03% of the time,” Norris said.
Norris also pointed to research using CDC data that showed more likelihood of maternal death in childbirth than in abortion.
The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists also used the information in saying abortion is a “safe medical intervention.”
“The risk of complication or mortality from abortion is less than the same risk from common procedures like wisdom tooth removal, cancer-screening colonoscopy and plastic surgery,” the group said on its website.
The group went further to say that restricting access to abortion “forces some pregnant people to continue their pregnancies to delivery, leaving them to face the many health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth.”
Ohioans are facing the risk of restricted access to reproductive care in some areas, with the closure of southwest Ohio Planned Parenthood clinics, and staffing reductions in the Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio clinics, which the facilities said were due to cuts to federal Medicaid funding and other federal resources.
Despite the closures and workforce limitations, Ohio clinics have encouraged clients to use telehealth for care (abortion and otherwise).
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced a plan to expand medication abortion services in Mansfield in September.
“Medication abortion is a safe and effective option for ending a pregnancy,” said Dr. Bhavik Kuma, chief medical officer for the greater Ohio affiliate, in a statement.
“Planned Parenthood will always follow evidence-informed standards and medical best practices to provide safe, high-quality abortion care and information to patients who come to us.”
Even with a request from the HHS secretary to once again review the medication abortion drug, the process is time-consuming, according to Zettler.
It would include reviewing evidence, assessing whether a different determination can be made about the drug, and about whether the benefits outweigh the risks, she said.
“So, the most important takeaway from this for states is that nothing has changed,” Zettler said. “Nothing’s going to change tomorrow and nothing’s changed today.”

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderA unique off-year election for two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, a body responsible for regulating utilities in the state, has Republicans vocally concerned, especially considering concurrent municipal elections that they worry could favor Democratic mobilization.
District 3 Public Service Commissioner Fitz Johnson. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
Early voting starts Tuesday for the Nov. 4 election, which will decide the fate of two incumbent Republican commissioners on the PSC — Tim Echols of District 2 and Fitz Johnson of District 3 — who are being challenged by Democratic candidates Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard, respectively. Fitz Johnson was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021. 
With the races operating outside the typical presidential or midterm election cycles, attention is low and local municipal races could inadvertently dictate the outcome of the statewide PSC contests, according to experts. 
Democrats are also hoping frustration over rising electricity bills will help motivate voters to turn out, with both Democratic candidates campaigning on utility affordability. 
Republicans appear to be ramping up efforts to energize their base. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp recently headlined a campaign event in Cumming for the Republican incumbents. Signs at the event said “Don’t Dem the lights in Georgia.” 
Josh McKoon, the chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said there was significant concern about Republican voter engagement in the PSC races. He said this election is important for two reasons: the PSC’s role in ensuring reliable energy, which is the “backbone” of Georgia’s economy, and the need to prevent the Democratic Party from gaining a “crack in the door” to the state’s governance.
“We have got to wake people up,” he said.

McKoon encouraged early voting, saying that “the more early voting we have, the easier it’s going to be to finish the drill and win this election.” He described the election as a “close election” in a “competitive state.” 
At the top of his speech, Kemp signaled his concerns about low Republican turnout and suggested that apprehension over the coming election drove first lady Marty Kemp to start wearing a shirt with the word “pray” on it. 
“You hardly even see (Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson) out there shaking any hands, asking anybody for a vote. They’re hoping nobody pays attention to this race. They don’t even want people to know that there is a race. That is our biggest liability in this race, as a lot of the speakers have talked about, is that people just don’t know what’s going on,” Kemp said.
Echols, who has served on the commission since 2011, acknowledged that Democrats have an advantage due to the numerous municipal elections taking place and, along with other speakers, pivoted to campaigning on cultural issues. He called his opponent, Alicia Johnson, a “DEI specialist” who “wants to bring DEI principles into health care companies, and now she wants to do that at the Public Service Commission.”

“She wants to bring DEI and wokeness to the PSC. We simply can’t let that happen, can we?” Echols said.
Alicia Johnson, the Democratic candidate for District 2, addressed the attack directly, calling the comments not just a “lie,” but a “racist, MAGA dog-whistle,” saying that her background is at the “intersection of community development, economic development and public policy.” She added that she believes the attack is a sign that the incumbents “are scared.”

“I think it really speaks to Tim Echols’ character and his personal values, and that it’s a reflection of him, not me,” Alicia Johnson said. “I’m not just a Black female, but I’m a wife, I’m a mother, I’m a grandmother, I’m a community leader. If he wants to point out that I’ve dedicated my career to helping people, communities and organizations grow stronger and healthier and more resilient, then way to go, Tim.”
Other speakers also resorted to culture war attacks, with Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor, claiming that the “Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists.” Congressman Mike Collins, a U.S. Senate candidate, said that allowing the two Democrats to be elected would bring back “that green new scam of Joe Biden’s America” along with “California values of less power, more brownouts and higher energy.”
But despite Republicans’ concerns about reaching voters, Hubbard was the only candidate who participated in a recent debate hosted by the Atlanta Press Club. Hubbard, who debated against an empty podium as Fitz Johnson declined to participate, used the absence of his opponent to launch a direct attack on the incumbent’s record.
“My question would be, why didn’t you have the courage to show up today and defend your six rate hikes in two years?” Hubbard asked.
Echols and his opponent, Alicia Johnson, also did not participate in the debate.

The role of municipal elections
Charles Bullock, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, said in an interview that because Georgia still leans conservative, Republicans, who are also incumbents, have a slight advantage. However, he pointed to the general low visibility of PSC races, saying that voters typically don’t know who the candidates are or what the PSC does. Voters in this case are likely to show up to vote for local candidates they know and “tend to fall back on party ID,” Bullock said.
“That’s the kind of situation which therefore may create the opening where Democrats could break through and win one or both of these,” Bullock said.
Democrats are pledging to be a check on rising utility bills. The current commission has come under scrutiny for approving a series of rate increases requested by Georgia Power. 
Bullock and fellow UGA political science professor Trey Hood emphasized that the simultaneous municipal elections in cities, typically where Democrats live and contested races are common, can provide a stronger incentive for voters to show up at the polls.
“I think the argument about Democrats being somewhat advantaged because of these local elections is probably more correct, or probably has more weight,” Hood said, compared to the argument about voters being dissatisfied with rising energy bills.
Bullock said if Democrats were to win either or both seats, “this would be quite inspiring and exciting for them” as they head into next year’s elections, because they may see it as conditions trending in their favor. He said that even if both Republican incumbents win, Democrats could still interpret results as an advantage heading into 2026, where most statewide seats will not have a Republican incumbent running, potentially opening the door for more competitive contests.
Voter frustration over utility bills
Democrats and energy advocates are banking on voter frustration over rising utility bills helping to energize voters.
Charles Hua of PowerLines, an organization focusing on consumer energy issues, said in an interview that nationally, utility bills are the “fastest driver of inflation right now,” adding that utility bills in Georgia “have increased 33% in the last two years, translating to about $500 per year.”
Hua said that utility affordability is a “very animating issue right now” and could mobilize voters, but that the challenge is that the awareness of the PSC’s role is not high. Most state agencies across the U.S. that regulate utilities are appointed, unlike in Georgia, where voters can choose each of the five commissioners.
“We’re in the homestretch 27 days. What’s possible? Look, I don’t know. We don’t know. We’re going to see this play out … We don’t know what the final turnout number will be because this is the only statewide election you know on the ballot, and most people have not heard of it,” Hua said.
Connie Di Cicco, political director for Georgia Conservation Voters, an organization focused on environmental protection advocacy, said the frustration is “almost palpable at this point,” and that she believes that the direct connection between the PSC and bills is a strong mobilizing issue.
“Affordability is just a universal issue that a lot of people are feeling all over the state, and that is something that people are very upset about, and literally hits home. So if you’re feeling it and you don’t like it, then you can vote for change and make something happen in November,” Di Cicco said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06614-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

A new law passed by California legislators creates a pathway to establish a regional market for managing the flow of energy throughout the West. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For years, Western leaders have debated the creation of a regional energy market: a coordinated grid to pool solar power in Arizona, wind in Wyoming, hydro in Washington and battery storage in California.
The shared resources would meet the demands of 11 different states, bolstering utilities’ local power plants with surplus energy from across the region.
With the passage of a landmark new law in California, that market is finally on its way to becoming a reality. Proponents say it has the potential to lower energy costs, make the grid more resilient and speed up the deployment of clean energy.
But the market’s success, experts agree, depends heavily on which states and utilities decide to opt in. As energy issues have become increasingly politicized, it’s uncertain whether Western leaders can buy into a common vision for meeting the region’s power needs.
“As we move toward weather-dependent renewables to run our grid, we’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern,” said California Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation aimed at establishing the new market. “A Western energy market is critical.”
The California measure earned bipartisan support, and leaders in conservative and liberal states alike have long touted the benefits of a region-wide market.
But some skeptics worry about merging the power systems of states with varying climate goals. And some fear the new market could give federal regulators appointed by President Donald Trump an opening to interfere and mandate more fossil fuel-powered plants that can be turned on regardless of the weather.
A bigger market
Across the 11 Western states that straddle or sit west of the Rocky Mountains, 37 separate private and public utilities operate portions of the grid.
States Reimagine Power Grids for Wind and Solar Future

This fragmented structure differs from the grid systems in Eastern and Midwestern states, where regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, coordinate and plan for energy needs across vast swaths of the country.
Backers of a Western market argue that a region-wide approach would be much more efficient.
Under the current system, each utility is required by state public utility commissions to build enough power to meet peak energy demands. That could mean building gas plants that only turn on a few times a year during extreme heat waves.
As part of a West-wide market, utilities could manage those high-demand events by importing power from other parts of the region that are generating surplus electricity. Such agreements could also prevent the periodic shutdowns of wind and solar farms when they produce more energy than local utilities can use.
“We could be drawing on the solar resources from the Southwest during the day, and then in the evening the wind resources in Montana and Wyoming are a great benefit,” said Austin Scharff, senior energy policy specialist with the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We have a lot of hydro resources, and we can help make sure the regional grid stays balanced when those are needed.”
Some industry leaders say such trading would allow states to pull in cheap electricity from elsewhere, rather than building expensive new power plants.
“When you have this bigger market, not everybody has to build to their peak in the same way,” said Leah Rubin Shen, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “Everybody’s able to share.”
Western states do trade electricity on a bilateral basis between individual utilities. Utilities spanning much of the West also transact through a real-time market that allows them to address pressing short-term demand issues. Some are poised to join a new day-ahead market that will conduct planning based on daily demand and production forecasts.










We’ve got to have a grid that is bigger than a weather pattern.


– California Democratic Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris


But some lawmakers and officials believe the region needs a larger vision that goes beyond moment-by-moment needs, a market that can plan interstate transmission lines and energy projects to serve the whole region in the decades to come.
“We’re facing really rapidly growing energy demand,” said Nevada Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat. “The best way for us to meet that is to effectively move energy all across the Western U.S. The only way we can do that is through an RTO.”
Watts sponsored a bill, enacted in 2021, that requires Nevada to join an RTO by 2030. Colorado also passed a law that year with a 2030 deadline for utilities to join an RTO.
“Any future is better than our status quo, which is 37 separate grids in the West,” said Chris Hansen, a former Democratic senator who sponsored the Colorado legislation. “We can lower costs and provide greater reliability if we’re sharing resources.”
Hansen now serves as CEO of La Plata Electric Association, an electric cooperative in southwestern Colorado.
A new market
The push for a West-wide market had always faced one major hurdle: Any market would likely include the massive geographical footprint and energy supply managed by the California Independent System Operator, or CAISO. As the West’s largest grid operator, CAISO manages the flow of electricity across most of the Golden State. It’s governed by a five-member board appointed by California’s governor, and other states were unlikely to sign up for a market in which they have no representation.
The law passed by California legislators last month allows for a new organization with independent governance from across the region to oversee Western energy markets.
“This legislation is a key reset and has been the largest sticking point in building a regional market,” said Amanda Ormond, managing director of the Western Grid Group, which advocates for a more efficient grid. “This is a primary concern of a lot of folks that has now been solved.”
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

The law sets in motion a yearslong process that will task regional leaders with establishing the organization’s governance and navigating a series of regulatory procedures. The new market could be in place by 2028.
State leaders across the West say the California law is a long-awaited development.
“You get this really good benefit from being able to optimize across a larger footprint than an individual utility can,” said Tim Kowalchik, research director with the Utah Office of Energy Development. “Those resources can play really well together.”
Utah led a study in 2021, collaborating with other Western states, exploring the potential for energy markets in the region. State officials say the research has helped drive the current effort.
“It was fascinating how substantial the benefits were,” said Letha Tawney, chair of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. “The interdependence of the West started to become much more apparent, and it really changed the conversation.”
The study looked at a variety of market options and found that an RTO would have significant benefits, lowering costs for electricity customers and promoting clean energy. Based on the study’s projections, the market would produce roughly $2 billion in gross benefits per year, largely by saving utilities from building extra capacity.
Another study in 2022, conducted by a pair of consulting firms, found that an RTO would create as many as 657,000 permanent jobs and bolster the region’s economy.
While Western leaders say the potential benefits are massive, no states outside of Nevada and Colorado have committed to joining a regional RTO. State leaders say they’ll be watching carefully to see what emerges from the new California law. While the decision on joining the market will largely be left to individual utilities, state regulators can play a major role by directing them to conduct an economic analysis of such a move.
State sovereignty
The push for a regional market has also faced opposition from skeptics who fear it undermines states’ power to set their own energy and climate goals. Some point to Eastern governors’ frustration with PJM Interconnection, the RTO that manages the grid across a swath of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic.
“It’s very dangerous,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, a California-based nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re giving up control of our sovereignty. Once a state’s in, it’s not the state that has the control.”
Some experts fear that states with significant coal or gas industries may be hesitant to join a market that could incentivize their utilities to import cheap solar power from elsewhere. On the flip side, some climate advocates in California are wary of plugging into a market that could support coal power from out of state.
“Some states are parochial-minded: ‘This is a California thing, and we don’t want anything to do with California,’” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit climate-focused group. “That one state’s government will not decide how a market will be operated, it’s a seismic shift in the industry.”

Backers of an RTO argue that it can incorporate states’ varying energy goals. They point to research showing that the market will support renewable power. But others fear merging fates with coal-heavy states could give federal regulators more leverage to intervene in favor of fossil-fuel power.
Even if Trump is out of office when the market comes online, the regulators he appoints to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will still be serving out their terms. Some believe FERC could set rules that require the new market to favor fossil fuel-powered resources.
“When you have a mixed market with a lot of coal plants, it creates opportunities for the Trump administration to rejigger the rules to favor coal,” said Matthew Freedman, renewables attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a California-based consumer advocacy group. “In another reality, this would have sounded like a hysterical concern, but it’s pretty obvious where [Trump’s appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] want to go.”
Freedman’s group pushed California lawmakers for protections that would have given states more flexibility to withdraw from the market, while also prohibiting “resource adequacy” mandates that could be used by the feds to prop up coal. While those elements were included in a Senate version of the bill, they were stripped from the Assembly bill that ultimately was passed.
Supporters of the bill say such concerns are overblown, and the new market is structured to avoid the pitfalls facing other RTOs.
“The simple economic fact is that right now clean energy resources are the cheapest in the world,” said Petrie-Norris, the law’s sponsor. “We’re going to see solar displacing dirty fuels rather than the reverse.”
Much depends on convincing states and utilities it’s in their best interests to join the market. The strength-in-numbers advantages of an RTO depend on widespread participation. While many Western leaders have long touted a region-wide market, the opportunity is arising at a time where energy has become a partisan issue.
Meanwhile, the long-awaited market emerging from California is facing new competition from the east. The Southwest Power Pool, an Arkansas-based RTO serving the middle of the country, is expanding its footprint in the West, with several utilities poised to join its day-ahead market.
“Anytime you have two neighboring utilities in different markets, you have seams that create a lot of friction and inefficiency,” said Rubin Shen, with the energy industry group. “Whether or not everybody can come together and be all-in on a full West-wide market, it’s too soon to tell.”

(Photo by K. Stoll/National Park Service)For more than 70 years, the American chestnut tree has, mostly, been absent from the landscape. But historical accounts of its grandeur and the tons of nutritious seeds it produced every fall have made it loom large in New England’s forest memory.
Now, as another tree disappears — the ash — scientists working in the White Mountains of New Hampshire hope they can document its demise to gain a new, deeper understanding of how species losses ripple through ecosystems.
When most American chestnuts were killed by chestnut blight in the first half of the 20th century, the loss of the species was felt both culturally and ecologically. The trees were among the largest in the forest, reaching heights of more than 100 feet. Scientists know the species took with it an autumnal chestnut crop that was nutritious for people and wildlife alike. They also suspect that the die-off disrupted tree-specific communities of insects and soil microbes. But regarding what those communities looked like, and to what extent their loss rippled through the forest ecosystem, they can only make educated guesses.
“More or less, the species has been deleted from the landscape,” said UNH professor Jeff Garnas, who studies forest ecosystems and health in the Northeast. “… That happened 100 years ago, and we really have very little ecological understanding of what the consequences of the loss of (American chestnut) are,” he said.
Now, Garnas and the other researchers working on the Ash Protection Experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains, hope they will be able to shed light on the effects of tree loss events by studying another as it unfolds.
Ash trees, members of the Fraxinus genus, are vanishing from forests across the Northeast, Midwest, and parts of the South as they fall victim to the invasive emerald ash borer. When the beetle infests an ash, the tree typically dies within three to five years. The emerald ash borer has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees across North America since it arrived, likely during the 1990s, according to Southern Forest Health. 
The emerald ash borer was first detected in New Hampshire in 2013 and has since made it to every county in the state. The future looks grim for ash in North America, Garnas said. And at Hubbard Brook, where the ash borer was first detected in July 2021, scientists are beginning to see trees dying off as it takes hold.
“As unfortunate as it is, the emerald ash borer stands to delete another, in this case, genus of trees … from our forests,” he said. “And so we wanted to take the opportunity to ask questions about the fundamental feedback between the tree species and associated biodiversity and ecosystem function.”
That feedback includes many relationships among forest organisms, from the microbes and fungi in the soil to plants and insects living beneath the tree canopy — all of which are shaped by trees. The ash tree protection experiment will allow scientists to track the impacts of ash borer on those communities and relationships, Garnas said. And while the exact impacts of the American chestnut’s decline all those years ago will remain a mystery, Garnas hopes the findings of this experiment will, among other things, help scientists get a better idea of what they may have looked like.
The experimental setup includes dozens of forested research plots in Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, each with seven to 15 “large, mature ash” trees, Garnas said. Ash trees in half of the plots were injected with a powerful insecticide at the outset of the study — which began in a flurry right after the invasive beetles were found at Hubbard Brook in 2021, he added.
The insecticide, emamectin benzoate, is derived from a compound produced by soil microbes. An injection can protect a tree for three to four years, Garnas said. However, he said, though the treatment has worked to protect trees from the emerald ash borer in the context of this experiment, it’s not a solution for ash loss more broadly. 
“At a forest scale, you know, it’s really not going to be feasible to fight this invasion with chemical pesticides. … It’s more of a spot treatment,” he said.
By preserving the trees involved in the study, the Ash Protection Experiment may provide a system to study ash for years to come, even when others of their kind have long since died, Garnas said. Researchers elsewhere use the pesticide to preserve some ash trees as seed stock. The conservationists who undertake this work, Garnas said, hope the emerald ash borer will eventually be vanquished, or at least managed.
“With the hope that some of the other management tools will come to fruition and be, you know, as effective as they can be, people are sort of anticipating being able to at least keep some ash in the forest so that it’s there for when it can thrive again,” Garnas said. “You know, whether that’s 10 years or 100 years off – It’s hard to say at the moment.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emeraldashborernps-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-13 05:57:00.125701

Now, serving as the executive director of the Wabanaki Alliance, the 41 year old said she is blown away by the breadth of people engaged with the issue. 
She shared these reflections with Maine Morning Star in light of the alliance’s third celebration of “Nihkaniyane: Let’s Go Forward Together” last week, when members and allies came together to recognize the coalition’s work and the relationships that make it possible. 
Noting the current political instability in the United States, Bryant said it is a precarious time for tribal rights, “but also, I see a lot of people turning to us and asking what they can do and I think that a lot of people want to work in their one little corner of the world.”
Since its founding in 2020, the Wabanaki Alliance has expanded, physically — with a coalition of more than 300 organizations across Maine and the addition of staff members — but also in the reach of its cause.

The Wabanaki Alliance was formed to advocate for changes to the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. That land agreement has resulted in the Wabanaki Nations — the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation — being treated differently than other federally recognized tribes, with a relationship to the state more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations. 
Since the organization’s creation, progress has been made. For example, the state expanded tribal authority to prosecute crimes. But Gov. Janet Mills vetoed the latest proposed change this year, bipartisan legislation that would have prevented the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. Mills has rejected sweeping reform and instead approached changing the relationship on a case-by-case basis. 
Though, already fairly widespread gubernatorial candidate support for tribal sovereignty suggests the state’s approach could change when Mills is termed out in 2026.

“I think it’s hard for tribal people sometimes to be widely accepted in the state,” Bryant said. “It’s such a weird line to walk sometimes, of being set in your stances of tribal sovereignty and having people accept you. There’s few people that do that very well.” 
One of those people, she said, is John Banks, a citizen of the Penobscot Nation who has dedicated his life to environmental stewardship. 
Banks, one of the Nihkaniyane honorees, was the longest serving member of the Maine-Indian State Tribal Commission, which is tasked with continually reviewing the effectiveness of the Settlement Act as well as the relationship between the Wabanaki Nations and state. He was also the first natural resources director for the Penobscot Nation, a role he served in for 41 years until his retirement in 2021.
Banks received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Natural Resources Council of Maine in 2021 and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2019. 
One of his many contributions to the protection of natural resources was his role in the Penobscot River Restoration Project that was completed in 2016. The project, which removed two dams and created a bypass around a third to open nearly 2,000 miles of habitat, led to millions of river herring, Atlantic salmon and other species returning in numbers not seen for two centuries.
Laura Rose Day, executive director of the Penobscot River Restoration Trust, has credited Banks with saving the negotiations between environmental groups and the hydro company to allow the project to move forward. She said Banks reminded everyone of the concept of “all my relations,” the Indigenous idea that everything is interconnected, in explaining the shared responsibility for the river.
Banks and the two other honorees this year represent the passing on of generational wisdom in several respects.

Brianne Lolar, the Wabanaki Studies specialist for the Maine Department of Education, is a former teacher who has been working to help other educators include Wabanaki studies in their curricula. While it has been required teaching under state law since 2001, a 2022 report found it had not been meaningfully implemented across the state.
The author of that 2001 law, Donna Loring, suggested Lolar as an honoree, which Bryant said speaks volumes about how everyone is in this work together. 
“Instead of feeling any kind of complicated feelings about it not landing perfectly or being supported, she wants to really push forward Brie’s work,” Bryant said of Loring, who formerly served as Mills’ senior advisor on tribal affairs and on behalf of Penobscot Nation as a nonvoting member of the Maine Legislature, among other positions. 
The Legislature has attempted several times to pass a new law to allocate resources to ensure that this required curriculum is adequately taught, however such efforts have so far failed. The latest bill that sought to do this wasn’t funded last session and is being carried over to the coming year for further consideration. 
When talking about Passamoquoddy citizen Emma Soctomah, who is being honored for her academic achievements, Bryant highlighted the foundation for change laid by her father, Donald Soctomah.
As a state representative for the Passamaqoddy Tribe, he got a law passed to remove the sq-slur from place names in Maine. That was the first bill Bryant had ever testified on as a teenager, so she also personally credits Soctomah for sparking her desire to fight for legislative change. 
(Similar to the implementation of the Wabanaki studies law, there are continuing efforts to rectify noncompliance with Maine laws prohibiting racial slurs in the names of municipalities and other landmarks. But earlier this year a senator withdrew a bill that sought to do that because of the current political realities at the federal level.)

Soctomah’s mother, Elizabeth Neptune, is also a prominent name in public health work, having served for more than 13 years as director of health and human services for the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Indian Township.
So Emma Soctomah, too, exemplifies the kind of generational echoes seen between Loring and Lolar, Bryant said. 
“I’m familiar with the work of her parents,” Bryant said, “and then she gets to step in, educate, learn and be an example.”
This year, Soctomah was the valedictorian at the University of Maine at Machias. 
“My late grandmother always said the proudest moment of her life was when her children and grandchildren were to graduate,” Soctomah said in her valedictorian address. “I never truly understood why that was the case until fairly recently. Of course, she was happy to see us succeed but the pride went deeper than that. It comes from the obstacles that we, as Indigenous peoples, have to overcome.”
One in seven people in her Passamaquoddy community graduate with a bachelor’s degree, she said, compared to one in three people for the overall population.

Once the third-largest pharmacy chain in the United States, Rite Aid announced on its website that all of its stores are now closed. 
Health Care Dive reported the development on Oct.6. At the time of the closures, the chain was still operating more than 1,200 stores despite two bankruptcies, the news organization reported. 
“All Rite Aid stores have now closed,” the company’s website says. “We thank our loyal customers for their many years of support.”

Above the statement are buttons for now-former patrons to request their records and to find their new pharmacy if those records have been automatically transferred.
The closures are the latest blow to pharmacy access after years of complaints by independent and small-chain pharmacies. They have long claimed that middlemen owned by Fortune 15 health conglomerates have made their businesses unsustainable by sucking out all the profits.
Known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, the businesses decide which drugs are covered, negotiate non-transparent rebates with drugmakers, and decide how much to reimburse the pharmacies that had purchased and dispensed the drugs.
The three biggest PBMs control access to nearly 80% of patients. Their owners — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — also own top-ten insurers and pharmacies of their own. In other words, they decide how much to reimburse themselves as well as their competitors.
Critics say the system is rife with conflicts, and the Federal Trade Commission in January accused them of wild price hikes and possibly steering business to their own companies.
Big chains such as Rite Aid and Walgreens also are facing heavy competition from online retailers such as Amazon for business in front of the pharmacy counter. 
In June 2024, during its first bankruptcy, Rite Aid announced that it would close hundreds of stores in Ohio and Michigan. Ohio Board of Pharmacy spokesman Cameron McNamee said that as of Wednesday, Rite Aid had no active licenses in Ohio.

The company’s former stores join a host of others closing up in Ohio. 
When the board of pharmacy earlier this year unveiled a new tool to track closures, it revealed a sobering trend. Despite modest population growth, the number of pharmacies in the Buckeye State had dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory. 
The creation of pharmacy deserts — places where none is close by — are particularly hard and the poor and the elderly, and others for whom transportation is limited. 
It doesn’t only make it harder for those people to get their medicine. They also lose access to the one medical professional they can talk regularly to about chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Kansans often think of themselves as a rural people. Take the two of us, for example. We’re both lifelong Kansans who grew up in farming families, one in central Kansas, the other in northwestern Kansas, in the 1950s and 1960s.
Today, we both live in Lawrence.
Kansans are no longer a rural people. Almost half of the state’s population lives in just five of the state’s 105 counties: Johnson, Douglas, Shawnee, Wyandotte, and Sedgwick. Nearly one-fourth of the population lives in Johnson County alone. And the number of urban residents continues to grow.
That’s just one reason that the state’s public lands — our local, state, and federal parks and monuments — matter so much. Kansas ranks near the bottom in per capita public property.
Not only does Kansas have relatively small amount of park land, much of it is remote from the state’s population centers. The state’s largest parcel of publicly accessible property is the Cimarron National Grassland in Morton County in extreme southwestern Kansas. Many Kansans have never been there, maybe in part because the grassland is closer to the state capitals of Colorado, Oklahoma, and even New Mexico than it is to Topeka.
For an increasingly urban population, our state and federal parks are increasingly important. They are a way for people to know and enjoy the natural world. Plants and animals need these places too. With the threats of habitat fragmentation and climate change, these islands of the natural world are critical. Cranes and migratory shorebirds rely on Quivira National Wildlife Refuge and Cheyenne Bottoms in central Kansas. Because so many wetlands in this central flyway have been plowed up, those that remain are essential. These places also provide the public with places to watch birds, a growing pastime that generates its own economic benefit to local communities.
The love of these locations cuts across party lines. Poll after poll shows strong support for national parks. And people don’t just say it, they vote with their feet. National park visits hit 330 million in 2024.
That same support is evident on the local and state level.
For years, people asked us about the best places to see the Kansas chalk beds. But virtually all of these famous, scenic outcrops are on private property. In 2019, the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and the Kansas chapter of The Nature Conservancy opened Little Jerusalem, a 330-acre park in the chalk badlands of Logan County, south of Oakley.
Since its opening, Little Jerusalem has attracted thousands of visitors from across the country who hike the badlands, see prairie birds and plants, and ponder fossils on what was an ancient sea floor.
In short, our local, state, and federal parks are more popular and valuable than ever. They are also under threat. There are moves in Congress to sell federal lands. Staffing at the National Park Service has been cut. On the state level, park funding is regularly challenged, even though much of the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks budget is funded by permits and fees.
That’s why public support for local, state, and federal public property is crucial. On the federal level, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (proceeds from offshore drilling royalties) provides millions of dollars to Kansas for public properties.
On the state level, a coalition of more than 40 conservation organizations, from the Farm Bureau to Audubon of Kansas, have formed Kansans for Conservation. They’ve proposed long-term, dedicated funding for conservation projects across the state.
Elected officials should understand the widespread support for efforts like the LWCF fund. The proposal from Kansans for Conservation deserves serious consideration.
The two of us have been lucky. We’ve watched ferruginous hawks soar over Little Jerusalem. We’ve seen blue pitcher sage bloom on the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve. We’ve contemplated history at the Pawnee Indian Village Museum in Republic County and the military cemetery at Fort Scott.
If the public and elected officials stand up for them now, these places will be around for future generations of Kansans, no matter where they live.
Will Rogers once said, “Sanity is where you find it.” Many of us find it on public lands. We need these places. Now they need us.

While all of Ohio’s public universities saw an increase in enrollment, each university also saw a decline in international student enrollment.
Enrollment at most Ohio public universities is up, but international enrollment is down

Wright State University had the most modest decline in enrollment, losing 4.3% of its international students. 
Bowling Green University and Cleveland State University, had the largest relative losses, each losing about a third of their international student enrollment.
Enrolling international students brings benefits to the state of Ohio. 
International students usually pay “sticker price,” meaning the entirety of their tuition tends to go toward supporting the state system and providing education for other students. 
International students also bring new perspectives to the classroom and student organizations, helping enhance the learning experience of students from Ohio and out-of-state students who may live in Ohio after college. 
International students who come to Ohio for school are also more likely to stay in Ohio afterwards, helping to counteract Ohio’s “brain drain” problem by bringing qualified people from abroad to bolster Ohio’s workforce.
While national-level headwinds are hard to overcome, Ohio has some tools in its belt to attract international students.

Ohio could create a statewide tuition and internship initiative. This could use funds to create modest reductions in tuition in priority fields: think engineering, data science, and health. 
This could be paired with an internship program where universities work with Ohio employers to hire international students and keep them on after graduation. 
This could help bring in international students targeted towards filling holes in Ohio’s workforce, which would lead to higher earnings and more job creation in the state in the long run.
The state could also market its universities as a single destination, rather than 14 universities under different brands. 
Ohio has amenities that should make the state an attractive destination for international students: affordable cities, safety, and job opportunities in lucrative fields such as healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, and technology. 
Making Ohio’s offering clear could lead to, for instance, Miami University losing more international students to places like Ohio University and less places like Michigan State.
The state could invest in reducing bureaucratic friction for international students. 
Standardized driver’s license or state ID rules could make it easier for international students to get identification that can connect them to other amenities in the state. 
Statewide welcome centers at airports could give new international students a place to begin as they arrive in the state. 
And providing legal and visa services across universities, the system could help support international students in dealing with an increasingly fickle federal Department of State.
Finally, the state can try to help students stay in Ohio after they graduate. 
An H1-B bridge program with universities as sponsoring partners could help students transition into the working world. 
Requiring JobsOhio to count international talent retention as a key performance metric could also encourage companies to retain international students in the state.

(Marissa Lindemann/Nebraska News Service)The Big Lie is the stinker that keeps polluting the political atmosphere.
The latest iteration of its malodorous effect is Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen admitting that sending voter registration data to the U.S. Department of Justice is all right with him. Seriously? Evnen is okay — as is state Attorney General Mike Hilgers — with the DOJ having our birth dates, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of our Social Security numbers? I’ve ordered widgets online without disclosing that much info. 
To be fair, the feds already have our SSNs, and some other personal details might be appropriate for ERIC, the Electronic Registration Information Center, which helps states share data to keep voter rolls accurate and up to date.
But the DOJ? Apparently it needs the data to continue the Sisyphean sham that the 2020 presidential election was suspect. The miasma from that fractured fairytale of a crisis in our election integrity has since befouled the public discourse. The crisis took a hiatus during the 2024 general election. 
Here are some ideas: Let it go. Clear the air. Move on.
Nevertheless, the Big Lie’s coattail is Evnen’s rationale for sending our details to Washington — which, as of this writing, is blocked by a lawsuit. He maintains, without evidence, that Nebraska’s electoral house is in order but that other states might be letting non-citizens vote in numbers enough to swing an election. Sending our state’s voters’ private registration information to the DOJ, because we believe a lie that has been nothing but a lie since its inception makes little sense. 
When you register to vote, your name and address become part of a public record, available to whomever would want them although a fee is charged for access. To his credit, Evnen said he wants to know how secure the data would be and how it would be used. Gee, you think? Especially given our recent descent into data hell with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) coders.
The Big Lie remains just that, but its consequences have reshaped and to some extent hollowed out part of our democracy by eroding trust. In Nebraska, you can draw a straight line from the Big Lie to why we now present photo IDs to vote, despite no evidence that Nebraska ballot boxes were ever stuffed with unsavory Xs. 
While you have your pencil out, draw the same line to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the nation’s Capitol and the near-miss of having a free and fair election overturned. Nor was Nebraska alone in its wont to change its voting process without evidence a change was necessary. 
In 2021 alone, according to the Brennan Center for Justice,, 19 states enacted 34 restrictive laws that made casting a ballot harder than before. The Big Lie did more than call into question our elections without substantiation, it contributed to a growing distrust in the nation’s institutions. 
Your pencil should also connect to conspiracy theories, which add to this erosion of faith and are amplified by the exponential power of social media. We’re left with a sludge in which we can’t even agree on the facts, let alone something that approaches the truth. 
Unless you’ve been vacationing on a distant planet, you are also aware — or should be — that lying, from fibs to pants-on-fire fabrications, has become commonplace. If you’re an average American, you’re telling a whopper or at least a lie of some size about 11 times a week, according to research from the American Psychological Association. Some liars can’t seem to help themselves. According to the Journal of Social Psychology, more than half of us tell a lie three times within a 10-minute conversation. Yikes.
Those numbers seem high to me, but perhaps you know a compulsive liar  who skews the data. I’m not sure if it’s a compulsion, but I can think of a group — and where they work — who make stuff up as they go along. Maybe you can, too.
Perhaps of greater concern is our too often inability to ferret out a plain lie, challenge an incredulous assertion or believe a notion offered without relevant evidence. The same whitecoats disaggregating the numbers a couple paragraphs above might argue that we do that for a number of reasons, not the least of which is “confirmation bias,” believing what supports what we already believe.
All of which makes sense if you’re a scientist. But let’s not give the private data of Nebraska voters to the DOJ based on something that is simply not true.
