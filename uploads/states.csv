The Smyrna Eagles (4-4, 3-0 3A District 2) scored on all but one of their offensive drives defeating the St. Georges Hawks (5-3, 2-1 3A District 2), 44-12, Friday night. 
 
Smyrna defeated St. Georges, 44-12, Friday night earning its third win in a row — all against district opponents.  
The Eagles offense performed well in the passing game and the running game amassing over 200 yards on the ground and through the air. It was the passing game that got their offense going in the first quarter.
Junior quarterback Drew Marks and senior receiver Phoenix Henriquez connected four times on Smyrna’s opening drive as the offense traversed 64 yards down the field. Henriquez’s final catch of the drive was a nine yard touchdown that scored the game’s first points. 
The Eagles scored on their subsequent possession on a diving effort from senior Kahmaj Kearney at the goal line. Henriquez completed Smyrna’s first half scoring with a rushing touchdown right before halftime.
The Hawks scored once in the first half cutting the Eagles lead down to ten with less than six minutes remaining until halftime. 
Quarterback Jayden Goffigan and receiver Jordan Triplett connected on a 33-yard throw down the right side of the field that brought the offense to the Smyrna 16 yard line. Junior running back Joel Buck finished the drive with a two yard touchdown run off a direct snap, cutting into Smyrna’s lead. 
The Hawks scored again on their first possession after halftime driving 68 yards down the field. Junior running back Derek Foxmoor scored the touchdown with a two yard run up the middle from the shotgun formation. 
Smyrna scored the final three touchdowns of the second half all of which came on the ground. Henriquez, Marks and freshman Terrell Ingram all ran for a touchdown in the second half helping Smyrna to its second highest point total this season. 
The Eagles have two more games remaining in the regular season with a home matchup against Dover scheduled for November 1 and a road matchup against Sussex Central on November 7.
The Hawks will face Sussex Central before the Eagles with their matchup scheduled for November 1. After that game, St. Georges will finish the regular season on the road against Cape Henlopen on November 7.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gemini_Generated_Image_ufimraufimraufim.png,,,2025-10-25 13:16:44.335286

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Social Services plans to revamp its opioid treatment and prevention grants, with a three-tiered system including “transformative” grants up to $2 million.
Department officials announced the new grant structure using opioid settlement funds at Tuesday’s Board of Social Services meeting.
“Just trying to put some of the same window dressing on some of the same old methodologies isn’t what we’re after,” Secretary Matt Althoff said. “We’re looking for true innovation, a true effort to earnestly fill the gaps that exist today.”
South Dakota is projected to receive just under $99 million in settlement funds by 2038, based on the department’s settlement dashboard. The money comes from a series of nationwide settlements with the makers and sellers of the opioid painkillers that contributed to a spike in drug addiction and overdoses.
The majority of that funding will be distributed and spent by the state, while 30% will be used by local governments.
The state has received about $23 million in its share of the funds so far, with about $11.7 million uncommitted. The department plans to reserve about $12 million in a trust fund to sustain the state’s opioid abatement plan, in case federal funding for other substance use-related grants ends. That equates to about 25% of each disbursement received over the life of the settlement.

Most spent funds have gone toward the community grant program, with the state using part of its share to give additional money to local entities and organizations, followed by the prescription drug monitoring program, naloxone distribution (naloxone is a medication used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose) and overdose follow-up programs.
Brenna Koedam, behavior health division chief, said there is an increased number of referrals for opioid use and other substance use disorder treatment services, increased understanding in how to handle substance use among providers, reduced burnout among first responders and law enforcement, and reduced stigma surrounding opioid use disorder in the last few years. She did not explain to the board how most of those achievements were calculated or measured, though she attributed them to programming assisted by the settlement fund.
Opioid related deaths in South Dakota decreased to 39 in 2024, compared to 2023’s peak of 47. According to the state’s Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology data, 844 South Dakotans visited emergency departments for suspected drug overdoses — opioid and other — in the first six months of this year. That’s down by one visit compared to the same timeframe in 2024 and up by 44 compared to 2023. 
Attorney General Marty Jackley criticized the department in August for not spending the opioid settlement funds as quickly as he wanted, and not sending enough of the money to the city governments of Sioux Falls and Rapid City. Althoff said at the Tuesday meeting, and in response to Jackley’s comments in August, that the department needed to spend COVID-19 relief funds that were expiring before they spent more settlement dollars.

Koedam announced Tuesday that the department will restructure its community grants into three tiers:

Small grants of up to $5,000 for immediate or short-term projects, offered on an ongoing basis and focused on prevention, such as funding a speaker on opioid use and risks at a school district.
Mid-size grants of up to $50,000, offered twice a year, intended for projects that can be completed in a year.
“Transformative” grants of up to $2 million intended for regional innovation, which could include workforce development to attract more workers to the behavioral health field, based on a letter of interest from potential grant recipients.

Althoff said South Dakota’s substance use problems extend beyond opioids, citing meth and alcohol as other examples.
“The opioid dollars will not necessarily be able to just solve the opioid problem,” Althoff said. “We’re trying to be very creative about how we do this in ways that — even if opioid isn’t the first level of addiction, it might be even tertiary involvement — it’s all bridged and interrelated.”
Koedam added that the department signed contracts with Colorado-based Steadman Group and the University of South Dakota totaling just under $325,000 to conduct a statewide opioid needs assessment, which will identify gaps in South Dakota’s treatment and prevention infrastructure. The needs assessment is expected to be completed by spring 2026.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-25 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Tailgating traditions run deep in college football. A visit to The Grove and LSU’s Cajun feasts,"Maura Carey and Brett Martel, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/25/tailgating-traditions-college-football-the-grove-lsu-cajun-feasts/,"Tailgating is a beloved tradition in the South, rivaling college football itself. Fans at Ole Miss gather at The Grove for elaborate setups and the Walk of Champions. At LSU, tailgates feature Cajun cuisine.","In the South, there is only one thing that can rival college football itself: the party before kickoff.
Pinpointing the exact origins of tailgating is near impossible. Some trace it to Nov. 6, 1869, when Rutgers and New Jersey (later Princeton) played in the first college football game. Others credit Green Bay Packers fans, who folded down pickup truck tailgates for makeshift pregame seating during the team’s inaugural season in 1919.
Arguments over who has the best tailgating traditions are as old as the sport itself and the creativity is as varied as the fans themselves. From Bevo Boulevard (Texas) and the Tiger Walk (Clemson) to the Vol Navy (Tennessee) and the sailgating on boats outside Husky Stadium (Washington), the options are endless.
The tradition runs deep in the South, and few do it like Ole Miss and LSU.
It’s hours before kickoff. Ole Miss is hosting LSU in its biggest game of the season so far, and tens of thousands of fans gather at The Grove, a 10-acre plot in the center of campus surrounded by oak trees. The grassy area has transformed into a sea of red and blue tents decked out with chandeliers and elaborate spreads.

Anticipation builds for The Walk of Champions – one of the program’s longest-standing traditions where coaches and players are met with applause and “Hotty Toddy” cheers as they exit the buses and pass under the archway en route to the stadium.
Elizabeth Heiskell, a caterer from Oxford, is at the center of it all. She’s become a Grove regular since marrying into the fan base, and she wouldn’t want it any other way.
“It is a beautiful space right in the middle of campus with gorgeous trees that have been here forever,” Heiskell said. “There’s just really no place like it. It’s not like we’re, you know, dropping a tailgate in some parking lot. I mean, it is so green and so beautiful.”
Like most Grove goers, Heiskell is dressed for the occasion. She’s wearing a red and white blouse, gold jewelry and a fabulous pair of red sunglasses that tie the whole look together. This isn’t an outfit she just threw together; gameday getups are carefully curated.
“Of course everybody gets dressed up. I mean, we shop all year long for our game clothes,” she said. “When they say it’s a red game, honey, we’re all gonna wear red.”
The pregame buzz carries into Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, where nearly 68,000 fans watch Ole Miss hold off LSU for a 24-19 victory.
Two weeks later, crawfish boils and Cajun spices replace the chandeliers and elegance of The Grove as the party moves 330 miles South to Baton Rouge.
Fresh off a bye week, LSU is hosting South Carolina in Death Valley, where home-field advantage is alive and well, thanks to a passionate fan base of their own.

Gameday preparation begins early for Wayne Breaux, a fisherman from New Iberia, Louisiana. He drives up to his condo near campus on Thursday night, reserves his spot on Friday and begins the setup early Saturday. After 35 years, his tailgate has become quite the attraction. Breaux regularly welcomes football, basketball and softball coaches and recruits.
“Tailgating is an event in itself. A lot of people, even if they don’t have tickets to the game, they’ll come out and enjoy the atmosphere, the friendship and the camaraderie,” Breaux said. “I love the football game itself, but tailgating is a very close second.”
Like every good tailgate, Breaux’s setup centers around the menu. His spread features speckled trout, red fish, steak tips, pork loin, and of course, jambalaya and boudin.
“We got one rule,” Breaux said. “If you leave here thirsty or hungry, it’s your fault. It’s not mine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21135351/AP25290045208644.jpg,,,2025-10-25 08:16:40.899223

“Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” protestors chanted in the middle of Times Square, among a sea of signs that read “love reigns not kings,” “gays against faux-king Trump,” “we stand with … our trans family,” and “the future is coming.”
On Saturday, Oct. 18, independent analysts estimated that the No Kings March drew between
5 and 8 million people, and organizers say over 7 million people attended 2,700 events across all 50 states. The event, which was organized to push against the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., was the largest single-day protest in America since 1970.

Among the crowd were countless LGBTQ people, fighting back against an administration that has introduced a litany of anti-LGBTQ executive orders and used vile rhetoric to denigrate queer people.
This backsliding of LGBTQ rights, according to experts, has a deep connection to authoritarianism, with research showing that when governments weaken protections for queer and trans people, they often turn to broader democratic institutions next.
“Threats to democratic institutions and threats to LGBTQ rights are mutually reinforcing, generating a vicious cycle that strengthens authoritarian control,” said Ari Shaw, director of International Programs at the Williams Institute. “Increased persecution of minority groups, including LGBTI people, is itself evidence of democratic backsliding by indicating the erosion of liberal democratic norms meant to protect minority rights.”
 Legal Abuse of Power

One of the ways the Trump administration’s abuse of power has been most evident is through its legal actions.
On Jan. 20, Trump signed 26 executive orders, the most signed by any president on their first day. Since then, he’s penned hundreds more—more than President Joe Biden signed during his entire four-year term. In many cases, he bypassed Congress in the process, leaving elected legislators on the sidelines.
Many of these actions have targeted LGBTQ rights. Trump has used executive orders to ban transgender people from serving in the military, limit participation of transgender students in school sports, and direct federal agencies to recognize only two sexes.
He’s also slashed HIV funding at a staggering rate. Uncloseted Media estimates that the National Institutes of Health has terminated more than $1 billion worth of grants to HIV-related research, including 71% of all global HIV grants.
“The specific reason that I’m protesting is actually on the shirt I’m wearing,” said Brooklynite Jeffrey Cipriano. “My best friend works for an organization called AIDS United. … His job is to travel the country and help people get AIDS medication, specifically trans and unhoused community members. But his job is at risk.”
Executive orders are meant to direct how existing laws are implemented—but Trump has ignored democratic norms, filling agencies with loyalists, using orders to go after opponents, and pushing the limits of what the law allows.
“The President is directing various executive branch officials to adopt policy that has either not yet been adopted by Congress or is in violation of existing statutory law,” said Jodi Short, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “The analogy to a king … is the sheer consolidation of executive branch power in one individual.”
“Illegality has been rampant,” added Dave Owen, Short’s colleague. “People are often cynical about government … but most of the time, the executive branch takes the law seriously. This administration has broken with those traditions.”
 Revolt Against Executive Orders

Many Americans have recognized this. A survey from April found that 85% of Americans agreed that the president should obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t like them.
In response to Trump’s overreach, more than 460 legal challenges have been filed across the country challenging his executive actions. One is a federal lawsuit by Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation that challenges the constitutionality of the transgender military ban. Another lawsuit challenges Trump’s order withholding funds from medical providers offering gender-affirming care to minors.

Both lawsuits are why 17-year-old Zoe Boik joined the protest with her dad. “Obviously, I’m disappointed and kind of helpless because there’s nothing I can directly do to change or impact anything that’s going on,” said Boik, who identifies as pansexual and gender fluid.
 LGBTQ Rights and Democratic Backsliding

This type of blatant discrimination is often a key sign of a country moving closer to authoritarianism. A 2023 research paper by Shaw and colleagues found that anti-LGBTQ stigma may contribute “to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.”
“The level of acceptance of LGBTQ people is closely associated with the strength of democracy in a country,” said Shaw. “In some cases, rising anti-LGBTQ rhetoric or policies preceded a broader decline in democracy.”
Examples include Brazil under Bolsonaro and Poland under the Law and Justice Party, both of which saw LGBTQ rights regress alongside democratic erosion.
When it comes to LGBTQ rights, Trump has mirrored these leaders—even though most Americans don’t support it. A 2022 survey found that 80% of Americans favor laws protecting LGBTQ people against discrimination.
“The definition of an authoritarian system is a system where power is consolidated in one individual whose power is unchecked by any other institution,” said Short. “And I fear that’s the direction this administration is trying to move us.”
 Attacks on Higher Education

Another common tool in the authoritarian playbook is attacking higher education.
Trump has pressured top universities to eliminate DEI programs and inclusive policies for transgender athletes, calling them “ideological capture.”

“I’m here because I’m angry and I feel that we aren’t angry enough,” said Maddy Everlith, a gender studies major at Pace University. “Being a woman of color in America and having so many intersectional identities … I want to stand up and advocate for other people.”
 Scapegoating Transgender People

Beyond laws and policies lies a vile rhetoric used to scapegoat trans Americans. During the 2024 campaign, Trump spent roughly $215 million on anti-trans ads—more than five times what he spent on the economy.
“What Trump has done is he’s taken people that haven’t done anything wrong and has turned them into scapegoats,” said Lars Kindem, a retired pilot. “His language is hateful, petty, mean and hurtful.”
 Christian Nationalism

This scapegoating has fueled Trump’s alliance with white evangelical Protestants—the only major denomination in which most believe society has gone too far in accepting transgender people.
“For Christian nationalists, attacking LGBTQ rights is the first pillar in destroying civil rights for all,” said Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “This has happened in countries like Hungary and Poland, and now it’s happening here.”
 Moving Forward

As the country bleeds toward authoritarianism, LGBTQ protestors are encouraging people to use their voice—something the queer community knows well. A 2012 survey found that queer folks are 20 times more likely to be active in liberal social movements than their straight, cis counterparts.
“It is imperative that people continue to pay attention,” said Short. “We have to engage in political action and resist inappropriate assertions of authority and continue to show up and vote for our democracy.”
Seventeen-year-old Zoe Boik is ready. She remembers crying the day after Trump won in 2016. Now, she’s eager to vote in the next election.
“My fears about Trump don’t stem specifically from me being queer, but from his authoritarianism as a whole,” she said. “I am scared about how far he will move into dictatorship, and my biggest fear is that our right to vote will be compromised.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-1024x737.png,,,2025-10-25 07:16:56.258027

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said the decision left him feeling “extremely disappointed.” Crowley spoke from his office at the Milwaukee County Courthouse Friday, saying that the funds would go towards repairing parks, government buildings, and other public infrastructure damaged by the so-called flooding which swept communities two months ago. 
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially sent disaster relief after the floods, Crowley said he “commended the Trump administration,” and that “I thought that we were putting politics behind us in making sure that communities can recover.” Crowley said that by Friday over $123 million in financial assistance has been distributed to county residents for home repairs.

But it’s not just local businesses and homes that were damaged. The rainfall, which fell in a torrential downpour on the weekend of Aug. 9, left Hart Park in Wauwatosa underwater. Downed trees and other debris were strewn along roadways. Cars, swept away by the overnight flooding, were abandoned in the street for days. 
Over 1,800 homes were left damaged or destroyed, with an estimated $34 million in damage to public infrastructure. “The preliminary damage assessments show that the damage that we saw throughout all six counties is more than significant,” said Crowley. “Roads and bridges that our residents rely on sustained substantial damage. Public buildings and facilities were not only washed away, but in some cases had significant mold contamination that will also impact the public health and safety of our residents. Our parks and our trails, they were damaged, which will harm our quality of life in the short term, as well as the long term, and the list goes on.”
Crowley pointed to Hart Park as a prime example of an area with lingering damage additional funds could remedy. As the disaster relief is denied, Milwaukee County is also in the middle of crafting a budget which will not be padded by COVID-era federal funds. County supervisors are currently debating amendments to Crowley’s proposed $1.4 billion budget, which carries cuts to transit services and eviction legal defense programs and increases property taxes by 4.1%.
“We’re already making challenging decisions about funding not only programs and services, but future infrastructure spending, and capital projects that are needed not only now, but in the years ahead. Today’s action by the Trump administration will send us back even further. It will delay progress in our recovery efforts from this natural disaster, and it will place a financial burden solely on local taxpayers who have already had to sacrifice so much as a result of these floods.”

Gov. Tony Evers issued a statement Friday saying he filed an appeal asking the Trump administration to release more than $26.5 million in public assistance for infrastructure repair  it has denied. “Denying federal assistance doesn’t just delay recovery, it sends a message to our communities that they are on their own, and that the Trump administration doesn’t think over $26 million in damages to public infrastructure is worthy of their help,” Evers said in a press statement. “I couldn’t disagree more. The federal government should not expect our communities to go through this alone, and we are going to fight tooth and nail to ensure they get every possible resource to rebuild and recover. We are hopeful that the Trump administration will reconsider this decision, so we can make sure folks have the resources and support they need.”
The denial comes during a federal government shutdown that has lasted nearly a month. In a letter to Evers, FEMA said that while the flood damage was significant, assessments determined that “the public assistance program is not warranted.” 
The storm and flooding was dubbed a “thousand year storm” and dumped record-breaking amounts of rain essentially overnight. Wisconsin now has 30 days to send an appeal. 
“Turning your back on families facing washed-out roads, damaged schools, and flooded homes because they’re not seen as political allies is unconscionable,” said Kerry Schumann, executive director of Wisconsin Conservation Voters in a statement. “These communities didn’t cause this crisis, but they’re living through it. They deserve leadership that helps them recover and protects them from the next flood, not one that deepens the damage.”

“By denying federal assistance, the Trump Administration is leaving Wisconsin communities to fend for themselves,” said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. “No community can pick up these pieces alone, and Wisconsinites need support so they can rebuild and be on the road to recovery. I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on the Trump administration to step up to the plate and be here for Wisconsin communities left in the lurch.
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, Democrat of Milwaukee, also expressed  frustration. “Our state was forced to wait nearly two months for the Trump administration’s ill-advised and disappointing decision,” Moore said in a statement. “Communities in Milwaukee, which are still recovering, are counting on federal assistance to help fund critical repairs to public roadways, buildings, vehicles, and equipment that were severely damaged.” Nevertheless, Moore said, “Wisconsinites do not give up.” 
Rep. Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee) also issued a statement condemning the denial. Haywood said that the Trump administration “is sending a clear message to the people of Wisconsin – ‘we do not care about you’.” Haywood added that, “these funds are so badly needed to repair infrastructure, businesses, and schools. These are all essential to reverse the trend of President Trump’s faltering economy. Our residents pay millions in federal taxes and they should not face these hardships alone.” 
Haywood added  that Wisconsin’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) “is on the verge of drying up.” while  “communities are left to rebuild major infrastructure on their own, it is disappointing that the White House is choosing a $300 million ballroom ego-project over the well-being of the people of our state. It is my hope that FEMA reconsiders this decision to ensure that Wisconsin residents have a chance to recover and prosper. Wisconsinites deserve better and should demand better.”
Two bills related to disaster relief (AB-580 and AB-581) have been introduced to the Wisconsin Legislature as communities process the news. One bill would require the Department of Military Affairs to create a program to award grants to individuals and businesses severely impacted by disasters related to a state of emergency declared by the governor. Grants of no more than $25,000 could be awarded under the bill to an individual to help repair a residence, and grants of no more than $50,000 would go to businesses. The other bill would also work through the Department of Military Affairs, and would appropriate $10 million in  disaster assistance grants for individuals, and $20 million in grants for businesses in the 2025-26 fiscal year.

John Jagler (L) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R). Republicans scolded State Superintendent Jill Underly for not appearing at a hearing prompted by a Cap Times investigation of teacher sexual misconductU.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the leading Republican candidate for governor of Wisconsin, held a press conference on the steps of the state Capitol Thursday to declare his outrage over a Cap Times investigation that tracked more than 200 cases of alleged child sexual abuse by Wisconsin teachers and suggested a lack of accountability and transparency by the state Department of Public Instruction. 
Bolstering Tiffany’s case, State Superintendent Jill Underly decided to skip Thursday’s Senate hearing on the controversy. Instead, Underly traveled to Indiana to accept an award from her alma mater, leaving DPI staff to endure questioning by members of a state Senate committee eager to hang child sex abuse allegations around the necks of DPI, Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats.
Recognizing an opportunity, Tiffany parachuted in to add his voice to the chorus. “You will never have to wonder if I will show up,” Tiffany declared. “I will always be there for Wisconsin and our children, even when state Democrat leaders fail to do so.” He drew a tenuous connection between the accusation that DPI has provided insufficient oversight of predatory teachers to bashing the state agency for “lower standards” in schools and for embracing diversity, equity and inclusion. ”DPI spent two hours a week creating a DEI plan, but couldn’t find the time to investigate these cases,” Tiffany declared. He promised that if he’s elected governor he will ensure proper misconduct investigations of teachers and create a public dashboard showing why they lost their licenses, “most of all,” he added, “we’re going to educate kids, not indoctrinate.” 
As soon as Tiffany finished converting the story about abuse by teachers into red meat for his campaign, state Democrats jumped into the mosh pit, accusing him of hypocrisy because he voted against releasing the Epstein files. 
None of this mud-slinging sheds any light on what’s happening to kids in Wisconsin schools or how the state can better protect them.
Several of my daughters’ friends at Madison East High School were targeted by David Krutchen, a popular teacher who had close relationships with many of his students and who, it turned out, spent years spying on girls during overnight field trips, placing hidden cameras in hotel bathrooms and bedrooms. The Krutchen case took a heavy toll on those kids and their families. It was a shocking, disgusting betrayal of the students by a trusted adult. For years the court hearings dragged on, and traumatized students had to keep showing up to testify. Finally, Krutchen went to prison.
According to the Cap Times story, which includes interviews with some of Krutchen’s victims, DPI “shielded” more than 200 cases of teacher sexual misconduct from the public. That frame could lead you to believe that DPI was protecting pedophile teachers the same way the Catholic Church spent years shuffling pedophile priests around to avoid. But that’s not the impression I got from DPI’s testimony. In a video Underly posted on Facebook, and in her deputies’ testimony to legislators, the agency insisted that allowing teachers to voluntarily give up their licenses is not a “loophole” to end embarrassing investigations but ensures teachers who face misconduct charges are entered into a national database that can be accessed by other state education departments.
The Cap Times story, aided by a successful open records request, does give the sense that DPI has a slipshod system for keeping track of misconduct investigations, with just two staff people in charge of hundreds of cases, information stored on a Google spreadsheet, and 20% of cases where it’s unclear what type of misconduct was investigated. 
In its defense, DPI points out that the Legislature cut the agency’s budget by millions of dollars and they are doing their best. That point would have sounded better coming from Underly herself, instead of her deputies who had to fill in because she couldn’t bother to appear in person to demonstrate she actually cares about these horrible cases. 
Underly’s failure to show up and address the repercussions of the story is inexcusable. As the top educator in the state, she needs to reassure students and their parents that she cares about them and is on their side.
But the Republicans rushing to connect Underly’s weak leadership to all of their talking points about schools are equally unhelpful.
Ever since former Gov. Scott Walker began heaping scorn on teachers, painting them as lazy, overpaid and incompetent while ramming through his explosively controversial union-busting Act 10 law, the GOP has weaponized divisive distrust of teachers and public schools. Aided by a powerful private school choice lobby, they’ve hammered away on the idea that private schools are better and siphoned millions of dollars in taxpayer support for public education out of public classrooms and into the private sphere.
“We are going to make sure that Wisconsin goes back to the top of the game,” Tiffany declared Thursday, adding, “We are behind Mississippi in educational attainment. Less than one in three kids can read at grade level in the fourth grade in the state of Wisconsin. Is that not a disaster? That will not be the case if I’m elected as governor, we will have accountability and we will have higher standards.”
But the defunding of Wisconsin public schools that began under Walker and continues today is directly tied to the decline in quality. It’s not laziness or pedophilia that plague our school system. It’s deliberate neglect.
Republican calls for “higher standards” and “accountability” have, over the past two decades, been accompanied by disinvestment and the steady expansion of a publicly funded private voucher school system.
Ironically, the private schools Republicans champion in the school choice program have no teacher licensing requirements and DPI has no way to oversee or investigate their employees. Nor are private schools subject to Wisconsin’s open records laws. We will never get to see how they handle cases of employee misconduct.
There’s a reason it’s a big story when adults abuse the trust of children. It’s despicable behavior. Politicians who ignore or capitalize on that crime for political gain do us no good.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the regulatory conservation associate for the Idaho Conservation League, I have reviewed hundreds of pollution control permits for industrial facilities across Idaho. These permits allow facilities like factories and mines to conduct operations while being protective of public health, clean water and clean air. In particular, I have closely followed and pushed back against the development of Perpetua Resource’s Stibnite Gold Project. 
At central Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Mine, crews start initial construction 

I was encouraged by my colleague Dr. Ian von Lindern’s informative and expert-based commentary regarding the troubling health effects this mega-mine presents. I was surprised to see former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Andrew Wheeler, join the debate and directly address Dr. von Lindern’s comments in a rebuttal commentary. 
While engaging in tit for tat op-ed commentary might normally be unproductive, I feel it’s important to address the hypocrisy of his conclusion that “Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth,” as his opinion is neither scientific, transparent nor truthful. 
Mr. Wheeler’s “science” comments echo Perpetua’s testimony before the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. I heard these same arguments as both Dr. von Lindern and I testified during the same administrative hearing process Mr. Wheeler references. While I am unsure how much Mr. Wheeler familiarized himself with the complex air quality “science” of the issue, I am sure Idaho families should not trust Mr. Wheeler’s opinion on this matter. 
Mr. Wheeler’s claims are startling coming from an EPA director who consistently undermined science and transparency. As the Union of Concerned Scientists outlined back in 2019, during his time as EPA director, Mr. Wheeler sidelined and ignored scientists, proposed restricting scientific data, recommended unsafe levels of drinking water contaminants, and rolled back environmental protections. His rebuttal commentary is simply a continuation of uninformed and misleading attacks on science and the health of Americans in the interest of industry. 
Within his commentary, Mr. Wheeler touts his former work as the head of the EPA in “protecting Americans from toxic exposures” but fails to mention his current connection to Perpetua Resources. In 2024 Mr. Wheeler joined the west coast law firm, Holland and Hart as an expert in regulatory affairs. Holland and Hart currently represents Perpetua Resources and their proposed mine in no less than four environmental permit appeals including three brought by ICL and our partners. 
One involves a Clean Water Act permit under Idaho DEQ administrative appeal (Agency case number. 0102-24-02), one involves the U.S. Forest Service’s Record of Decision in federal court (see case number 1:25-cv-00086-AKB), one involves the same air permit referenced in Mr. Wheeler’s and Dr. von Lindern’s commentary that is now being appealed within state court (see case number CV01-25-13306). The fourth major litigation is an appeal of the same U.S. Forest Service Record of Decision by the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho in federal court (see case number 3:25-cv-00498-AKB). 
With four active legal cases, it’s fair to question if Mr. Wheeler is acting on behalf of the public, Holland and Hart or Perpetua Resources. 
While Perpetua Resources has recently announced it has started on initial construction of its mine, it’s important to note that the above permit appeals present serious unsettled questions regarding the environmental impact of the mine. Until these appeals are concluded, the outcome of the mine is far from certain.
As Dr. von Lindern and I both testified during the administrative hearing process, the special concessions that Idaho DEQ granted to Perpetua have never been provided to any other Idaho air quality permit. They create a precedent that represents legitimate threats to air quality and human health for all Idahoans moving forward. 
There is no dispute that Idaho DEQ’s Stibnite Project Specific Adjustment factor increases cancer risk to any children exposed to arsenic from operations at the Stibnite Gold Project, the question is whether that insult will “average out” over the remainder of the child’s life. Whether Idaho DEQ violated state rules in issuing Perpetua Resources this air pollution permit will now be determined in state court, a venue where personal interest and hypocrisy can be shed from “truth.”

(Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Flags will be flying at half-staff across Maine Saturday in remembrance of the victims of the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Saturday marks two years since the state’s deadliest mass shooting at Just-In-Time Recreation and Schemengees Bar and Grille that killed 18 people and injured 13 others. 
“Although nothing can lessen their loss, we grieve with the families of the victims and the survivors of the Lewiston tragedy so that no one feels alone,” said Gov. Janet Mills. “We open our hearts to those who were injured and to those who are still struggling with the aftermath of that night. And we offer unending gratitude to the people whose heroic actions saved lives and set us on the long and winding road to healing.”
There are several events planned in Lewiston to mark the anniversary.
On Friday, community members gathered on Longley Bridge, where many held homemade signs on posters that said, “We Remember.”
“By leaning on our collective love for Lewiston, we will build a safer, more connected, and resilient future,” said Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline in a statement.
On Saturday afternoon, the Yes on Question 2 campaign, which is backing a statewide ballot initiative to adopt a red flag law, is hosting an interfaith event at 3 p.m. at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Lewiston. 
In addition to faith community leaders, Arthur Barnard, the father of Lewiston victim Artie Strout, and Joe Anderson, a doctor who worked in the emergency room the night of the shooting, will speak at the event. 
In early September, survivors and victims’ family members filed a lawsuit against the United States for negligence in failing to respond to warning signs and an explicit threat to commit a mass shooting. The lawsuit points to many of the findings of state and Army investigations, which concluded multi-agency failures related to the handling of perpetrator Robert Card II’s deteriorating mental health in the months leading up to the shooting.

(Zhang Mingming/VCG via Getty Images)The high-profile heist at the Louvre in Paris on Oct 19, 2025, played out like a scene from a Hollywood movie: a gang of thieves steal an assortment of dazzling royal jewels on display at one of the world’s most famous museums.
But with the authorities hot in pursuit, the robbers still have more work to do: How can they capitalize on their haul?
Most stolen works are never found. In the art crime courses I teach, I often point out that the recovery rate is below 10%. This is particularly disturbing when you consider that between 50,000 and 100,000 artworks are stolen each year globally — the actual number may be higher due to underreporting — with the majority stolen from Europe.
That said, it’s quite difficult to actually make money off stolen works of art. Yet the types of objects stolen from the Louvre — eight pieces of priceless jewelry — could give these thieves an upper hand.
At 9:30 a.m. local time on Oct. 19, 2025, four thieves reportedly used a lift mounted on a vehicle to enter the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery. (Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images)
 
A narrow market of buyers
Pilfered paintings can’t be sold on the art market because thieves can’t convey what’s known as “good title,” the ownership rights that belong to a legal owner. Furthermore, no reputable auction house or dealer would knowingly sell stolen art, nor would responsible collectors purchase stolen property.
But that doesn’t mean stolen paintings don’t have value.
In 2002, thieves broke into Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum through the roof and departed with “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen” in tow. In 2016, Italian police recovered the relatively unscathed artworks from a Mafia safehouse in Naples. It isn’t clear whether the Mafia actually purchased the works, but it’s common for criminal syndicates to hold onto valuable assets as collateral of some sort.
Other times, stolen works do unwittingly end up in the hands of collectors.
In the 1960s in New York City, an employee of the Guggenheim Museum stole a Marc Chagall painting from storage. But the crime wasn’t even discovered until an inventory was taken years later. Unable to locate the work, the museum simply removed it from its records.
In the meantime, collectors Jules and Rachel Lubell bought the piece for US$17,000 from a gallery. When the couple requested that an auction house review the work for an estimate, a former Guggenheim employee at Sotheby’s recognized it as the missing painting.
Guggenheim demanded that the painting be returned, and a contentious court battle ensued. In the end, the parties settled the case, and the painting was returned to the museum after an undisclosed sum was paid to the collectors.
Some people do knowingly buy stolen art. After World War II, stolen works circulated on the market, with buyers fully aware of the widespread plunder that had just taken place across Europe.
Eventually, international laws were developed that gave the original owners the opportunity to recover looted property, even decades after the fact. In the U.S., for example, the law even allows descendants of the original owners to regain ownership of stolen works, provided they can offer enough evidence to prove their claims.
 
Jewels and gold easier to monetize
The Louvre theft didn’t involve paintings, though. The thieves came away with bejeweled property: a sapphire diadem; a necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an opulent matching set of earrings and a necklace that belonged to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a diamond brooch; and Empress Eugénie’s diadem and her corsage-bow brooch.
These centuries-old, exquisitely crafted works have unique historic and cultural value. But even if each one were broken to bits and sold for parts, they would still be worth a lot of money. Thieves can peddle the precious gemstones and metals to unscrupulous dealers and jewelers, who could reshape and sell them. Even at a fraction of their value — the price received for looted art is always far lower than that received for legitimately sourced art — the gems are worth millions of dollars.

While difficult to sell stolen goods on the legitimate market, there is an underground market for looted artworks. The pieces may be sold in backrooms, in private meetings or even on the dark web, where participants cannot be identified. Studies have also revealed that stolen — and sometimes forged — art and antiquities often appear on mainstream e-commerce sites like Facebook and eBay. After making a sale, the vendor may delete his or her online store and disappear.
 
A heist’s sensational allure
While films like “The Thomas Crown Affair” feature dramatic heists pulled off by impossibly attractive bandits, most art crimes are far more mundane.
Art theft is usually a crime of opportunity, and it tends to take place not in the heavily guarded halls of cultural institutions, but in storage units or while works are in transit.
Most large museums and cultural institutions do not display all the objects within their care. Instead, they sit in storage. Less than 10% of the Louvre’s collection is ever on display at one time — only about 35,000 of the museum’s 600,000 objects. The rest can remain unseen for years, even decades.
Works in storage can be unintentionally misplaced — like Andy Warhol’s rare silkscreen “Princess Beatrix,” which was likely accidentally discarded, along with 45 other works, during the renovation of a Dutch town hall — or simply pilfered by employees. According to the FBI, about 90% of museum heists are inside jobs.
In fact, days before the Louvre crime, a Picasso work valued at $650,000, “Still Life with Guitar,” went missing during its journey from Madrid to Granada. The painting was part of a shipment including other works by the Spanish master, but when the shipping packages were opened, the piece was missing. The incident received much less public attention.
To me, the biggest mistake the thieves made wasn’t abandoning the crown they dropped or the vest they discarded, essentially leaving clues for the authorities.
Rather, it was the brazen nature of the heist itself — one that captured the world’s attention, all but ensuring that French detectives, independent sleuths and international law enforcement will be on the lookout for new pieces of gold, gems and royal bling being offered up for sale in the years to come.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)As farmers say at the Hedgeapple cattle farm in Frederick County, their cows live a good life, with one bad day.
All day, the cows graze on the Buckeystown farm’s grassy hills: Two herds with 45 pairs of heifers and steers, plus their calves. And even as autumn settles in and cold temperatures arrive, the cows still have months of grazing in front of them. Their pastures will stay grassy — by design.
The farm uses a practice called rotational grazing — moving the herds from pasture to pasture, then allowing grazed areas to re-grow over a period of 30 days or more.
The practice allows the farm to continue cattle grazing through January, said farm manager Chris Zook, saving them about $200 a day that would be needed to buy bales of hay to feed their hundreds of Black Angus and red/Akaushi Wagyu cattle.
“Take care of your grasses, and they will take care of you,” Zook says.
The practice was highlighted during a tour of the farm Thursday, one of several farm visits in the region led by the nonprofits Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Mobilize Frederick. The tour, focused on regenerative agriculture, attracted a combination of farmers, elected officials and environmentalists.

That’s because in addition to the economic benefits cited by Zook, the practice has a host of ecological perks, too.
By allowing the grass to regrow, quadrant by quadrant, the farm anchors its soil in place, reducing the amount of runoff during rainstorms from its fields into the nearby Monocacy River, which flows into the Potomac, which empties into the Chesapeake Bay.
So the farm is just one of many cogs in the overall effort to reduce the flow of harmful pollutants — including the nitrogen and phosphorus from manure — into the nation’s largest estuary.
Reducing agricultural pollution was one of the more stubborn pieces of the multistate plan to improve the bay by 2025, which fell short. The agreement is currently undergoing a reconstruction process that some have maligned as unambitious. Discussions are ongoing, and the leaders of the bay states are expected to sign off on a finalized agreement in December.
Policymakers have found success in other areas, including updating sewage treatment plants and planting thousands of filtering oysters. But as the population of people and animals in the bay’s watershed expands, slowing pollution from city streets and farm fields has proven to be a challenge
Though they may sound simple, regenerative practices like rotational grazing can actually require considerable extra labor — and capital. For example, Hedgeapple Farms had to ensure that it could transport water to all of the pastures used for grazing, either using water lines or portable tanks.
Hedgeapple largely funded the changes itself, but there are some funds that farmers can tap into, including from state and federal government sources, like the USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Farmers also have a host of other worries, including drought conditions and rising costs for fuel, equipment and animal feed. Many have side jobs that make additional work too cumbersome, Zook said.
But a big challenge is also spreading the word, said assistant farm manager Seth Young.
“A lot of people, they’re told about it. But they never actually show the results,” Young said.
Some farmers also struggle to adopt new practices because of an adherence to tradition. They farm just as their grandparents or great-grandparents did, said Mark Townsend, a farmer who also serves as treasurer for the Maryland-Delaware Forage Council. Maybe that means they follow an old adage: “plant in the dust, and your bins will bust,” which urged farmers to plant seeds during dry, dusty conditions.
But conservationists urge farmers to plant “cover crops” during the off season. In Maryland, the Department of Agriculture provides compensatory payments to farmers to plant barley, rye and clover after they harvest their crops, to hold their fields in place during the off-season. It can be an intimidating change, Townsend said.
“To drive your planter through 8-foot tall rye? It’s like, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s horrifying,” Townsend said. “You’re like: ‘This is so against everything that I’ve ever known. And so, there’s a huge mental barrier, rightfully so.”
The farm’s commitment to sustainability runs deeper than just the rotational grazing. The farm also used grants from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to plant more than 2,400 trees around the pastures, which will also help to reduce runoff into the Monocacy.

Initially, Zook said he feared that the perimeter of trees would cut the amount of space in each pasture, but ultimately they did not. Now, he’s more focused on the benefits, including the opportunities for cattle to seek shade during hot summer days. The farm’s practices are also a benefit to other living creatures, such as honeybees, said John Gardner, a local resident who cares for six hives on the property.
Hedgeapple is a quality home for the bees, who frequently venture from their hive boxes to forage, because its fields have more plant diversity than other farms.
“I tell people, when I see huge, golden, vast acres of corn, from the bee’s standpoint, I’m looking at a desert,” Gardner said.
Corn is wind-pollinated, and doesn’t need to attract pollinators. And pesticides and herbicides used on corn fields also endanger bees’ efforts to collect pollen, Gardner said.
The gangly tall grasses on the fields at Hedgeapple also are an ideal habitat for grassland birds, which rely on pasture habitats but are threatened by urban sprawl and changing farming practices, said Gabriel Foley of the Maryland Bird Conservation Partnership.
The Partnership uses nesting boxes to attract both American kestrels and barn owls to these habitats, where they can feed on insects and small mammals, Foley said.
Perhaps the most popular tool to show off the value of regenerative practices like cover crops and reduced grazing is a rain simulator: essentially, a shower head pointed at a variety of soil samples to show the effects of plantings on runoff.
Glass jars hang from each sample area, so viewers can see just how muddy the rainwater runoff becomes. Thursday’s selections included tilled soil, soil that hadn’t been tilled, allowing a small amount of vegetation to grow, and soil with cover crop planted.

But the winner was, perhaps unsurprisingly, the patch of dirt and long grasses dug up from a corner of Hedgeapple Farm that morning. The water in that jar was nearly clear.
When the simulator runs, rain spews from the spigot, sending about an inch of rain onto the small plots in a matter of minutes. It’s an outlandish — but not impossible– rate. Yet, it still shows the importance of snaring soils with a diverse array of plant life, Townsend said.
“If you weren’t necessarily prepared to take in all that water at that one time, you’re kind of left sitting — irony intended — high and dry, right?” Townsend said. “You’re not getting the water that you actually need into that soil, because you don’t have the mechanisms by which to absorb it.”
Amanda Grev, a forage and pasture specialist at the University of Maryland Extension, said that the practices aren’t just meant to save the bay, but to save farmers money, including on fertilizer, that would otherwise wash away during intense storms.
“The goal of these practices is, in the long run, to save you money, right? We’re not trying to spend thousands and thousands of dollars purely for the sake of being regenerative,” Grev said. “We may have a little bit of expense initially, but how much are we saving in terms of soil and nutrients?”

(Photo by SimpleImages/Getty Stock Images)Thirty-four people died from heat-related causes in Maryland during the late April to early October “heat season” this year, the second-highest number of heat-related deaths since records became publicly available in 2012.
Since deaths hit 46 in 2012 — when a July storm disrupted the power and air conditioning to many Maryland homes for days as a heat wave hit — the number had never been above 30, and has been as low as five in a year.
Of the 34 people who suffered heat-related deaths this summer, 24, or about 71%, were 65 or older, according to state data. Six people who died from heat-related causes were between ages 45-64, two were 18-44 and two were under age 18.
“Older adults often have chronic medical conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory, that can increase their susceptibility to excessive heat,” according to a statement from the Maryland Department of Health.
Despite that, 18- to 44-year-olds had the highest number of emergency department and urgent care visits this year, accounting for 688 of the total 1,672 this summer. Those 65 and older recorded 416 emergency room visits, followed by the 399 for the 44-65 age group, as of the Oct. 8 report.

Emergency department visits were significantly higher than the 1,206 recorded last year. The number of calls for emergency medical service was also up sharply this year, from 1,502 in 2024 to 1,645 this year.
The number of heat-related emergency room visits spiked during a heat wave in late June that saw 379 emergency department or urgent care visits and 400 EMS calls, according to state data. Almost two-thirds of the deaths, 21 of them, occurred over a two-week period in June and July that saw extremely high temperatures and heat indices, according to the health department’s statement.
“Daily heat indices during this time exceeded 100 degrees with some areas exceeding 110 degrees,” the statement said.
The region that includes Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties and Baltimore City had the most emergency department or urgent care visits this season. Their total of 688 surpasses other regions’ totals by at least 250 visits and past years’ totals by at least 200.
Of the 34 deaths, half were reported to be indoors. Some of the indoor deaths were related to non-functioning or non-existent cooling systems, such as fans or air conditioning units. Other reports indicated “hoarding or cluttered living conditions which can cause a decrease in air flow reducing the effectiveness of cooling systems,” according to the health department’s statement.
The other eight and nine deaths were in vehicles and outdoors, respectively.
Baltimore City and Baltimore County had the highest number of heat-related deaths this season, reaching eight and six, respectively. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties both had three heat-related deaths, and the 10 other counties that recorded heat-deaths had one or two each this heat season.
The Baltimore City Health Department issued four extreme heat alerts during this heat season — with one late July alert lasting almost a week after two extensions, according to department statements The press releases reference multiple instances of daily high temperatures that reach over 100 degrees, and “dangerously high temperatures and high humidity.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The sustained heat wave continues to pose a serious threat to public health, particularly for our most vulnerable residents,” Mary Beth Haller, Baltimore City’s interim health commissioner, said in a July 30 press release concerning the second extension of an extreme heat alert.
Montgomery County issued two heat emergency alerts during this heat season, warning citizens of high “feels-like” temperatures and heat indexes.

WASHINGTON – The sounds of destruction echoed around the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue Wednesday afternoon.
“Where is the outrage?” asked Nadine Seiler, a Waldorf, Maryland, resident and activist. “There is no way that … Republican voters would have been OK … with Obama or Biden or Clinton demolishing part of this building.”
“I’m like, really really angry,” she said.
Despite President Donald Trump’s promise that his plans for a massive, $300 million ballroom would not “interfere with the current building,” demolition of the East Wing began Monday and was largely complete by Friday. The destruction has sparked widespread alarm from the public, Democratic lawmakers and historic preservationists.
The first lady’s offices and a visitors’ entrance were located in the East Wing. Originally, the space of a terrace during Thomas Jefferson’s presidency, the East Wing was built in 1902 under President Theodore Roosevelt and expanded in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, providing both office space and housing for staff.
Trump’s ballroom, which is intended as an entertaining space that he claims will be able to host 999 people, is planned to be 90,000 square feet. The White House itself is currently an estimated 55,000 square feet.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation on Tuesday urged the Trump administration and the National Park Service “to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes.”

“We acknowledge the utility of a larger meeting space at the White House, but we are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself…and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,” Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the organization, said in a statement.
Seiler, a former employee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said that it is not possible to get approvals to do any renovations on a historic building such as the White House in fewer than nine months.
“The fact that he could come … and demolish this building, he is number two-ing and peeing all over the Constitution,” Seiler said.
John Sentena, a Colorado resident, views the president’s actions as “pushing the boundaries,” which is what he said he believes the president should do. He also commented on the lack of legal pushback, saying that nobody has pursued legal action over the demolition.
“If someone sues him for it, then there’s probably something to it,” Sentena said.
He said he has supported Trump’s presidency thus far and especially appreciates the impact of his actions.
“It’s only been not even a year … and all these people that are riled up. I wonder how long it can last,” he said.
But Cathy Raines, a Washington resident, said that the “president of the country should be a role model for following protocols.”
Raines said that Trump’s actions are unsurprising because she believes that every department of his administration has failed to follow legal guidelines.
“The White House is a longstanding symbol of our country, meant to be the people’s house,” Raines said.
Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, blistered Trump Wednesday for the destruction of the East Wing.
“President Trump’s desecration of the White House is an insult to the American people and a betrayal of his obligation to safeguard our history and heritage,” King said in a statement.

The senator is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s national parks subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over, among other things, national historic sites and historic preservation.
“The White House does not belong to President Trump; it belongs to the American people – he is but a temporary resident with no right to despoil this iconic landmark on his personal whim,” King said. “The house was purposefully never intended to be a palace, but rather a residence befitting a democratically elected leader, and an important symbol of our rejection of the trappings of royalty.”

Demand for electricity -- mostly from power-hungry data center springing up in the region -- are a prime factor behind rising electricity costs, but progressives and conservatives have different ideas on how to solve the problem. (Photo by Don Nichols/Getty iStock image)Maryland lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said this week that it’s time for a multistate coalition to focus on reducing energy costs for strapped utility customers.
Don’t get your bipartisan hopes up: Each side announced its own coalition, with completely different strategies.
One, announced by Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), wants to shield consumers from power infrastructure costs associated with the rising number of data centers in the region. The group convened its inaugural meeting this week, featuring legislators from many of the 13 states, including Maryland, that are part of the electric grid operated by PJM Interconnection.
It comes as PJM is in the midst of a consequential process to decide how to handle projections that the grid’s “peak load” could grow by 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with about 30 gigawatts of that total attributable to data center demand.
Costs from increased demand could be near $100 billion, Hester said. The current default setting is for all ratepayers to share the burden of new transmission lines and upsets in the balance of supply and demand, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery).
“You have to have a proposal that explicitly protects ratepayers in order for ratepayers not to bear the brunt,” Charkoudian said. “So, if a proposal is silent on who’s paying, then it is our residential ratepayers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The other coalition, announced this week by House members in the Maryland Freedom Caucus, seems focused instead on bolstering energy supply to address high bills, which Del. Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel) blames on “a delusional climate cultist ideology” for shuttering Maryland fossil fuel power plants.
The group, which currently includes legislators from Pennsylvania, said it will host a series of “Powering the Mid-Atlantic” hearings across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, according to a Wednesday news release.
Del. Robin Grammer (R-Baltimore County), another member of the coalition, called on the Democratic majority in the General Assembly to ditch policies focused on reducing greenhouse gases in the face of the state’s energy challenges. He also urged leaders to end the EmPOWER Maryland surcharge on ratepayers’ bills, which funds energy efficiency programs for Maryland households and efforts to transition away from fossil fuel heating.
“We’re trying to fill this gap of leadership, where, frankly, we’re seeing absolute silence,” Grammer said. “The legislature should be stepping up and saying: ‘We all care about sustainability, but we’re at the point where we’re seeing blackouts.'”
Hawley takes charge at MABE
Cecil County Board of Education President Diana Hawley was sworn in Monday as the new president of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.
Hawley, who will lead the organization for the 2025-26 term, took the helm during MABE’s annual conference this week in Annapolis. She replaces Karin M. Bailey, who currently serves as chair of the St. Mary’s County Board of Education.
Hawley has served on the Cecil County school board since 2018 and served on MABEs board of directors since 2021.

“At MABE, we’ve seen up close Diana’s rock-solid commitment to Maryland students and public schools,” MABE Executive Director Milt Nagel said in a statement released Wednesday. “Her extensive experience in Maryland’s education community means she brings a valuable first-hand perspective to MABE members’ collective work championing excellence in Maryland public education. Despite such challenging times for public education as a whole, we see great things ahead under her collaborative, innovative leadership.”
Besides selecting a new president, the conference also elected new officers with Brenda Wolff of Montgomery County as president-elect, Karen Yoho of Frederick County as the new treasurer and Jolene Mosley of Howard County as the new secretary. The nonprofit organization founded in 1957 advocates on behalf of the state’s 24 local school boards.
State Superintendent Carey Wright took the opportunity of this week’s MABE conference to provide school leaders with updates on literacy and math policies, nearly $21 million in philanthropic support for various programs and initiatives and a summary on test results.
According to a PowerPoint document from Wright at the conference, she also highlighted a plan to request funding for instructional coaching from the General Assembly during the 2026 legislative session. The legislature did approve what educators call a “coaching program” within the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, but without the funds.
Teachers choose from among their own for board
The Maryland State Department of Education and the state school board will hold a two-week election to choose a new educator to serve on the board.
Twenty educators are seeking the teacher position on the board that came open when Rachel McCusker stepped down in August, after she became an assistant principal in Carroll County. McCusker was the board’s first official teacher member after being chosen by educators in December 2019.
Voting is open to any teacher who has an active state educator certificate or license in at least one teacher area as of Oct. 10. Voting will take place from Nov. 3 through Nov. 17, with a second round of voting Dec. 1-15 if there’s a tie.

Notre Dame president to step down
Notre Dame of Maryland University President Marylou Yam will step down June 30, 2026, after 12 years in the job, the university announced this week.
“Over the past decade, we have faced some difficult challenges, including a global pandemic, but together with a spirit of innovation and resilience, we stayed steadfast in our mission and values; and in doing so we were able to advance our strategic goals and priorities forward successfully,” Yam said in a statement from the school.

During her time as president, Yam saw the university through the COVID-19 pandemic and oversaw a $52.6 million fundraising campaign, the school’s largest, to support students, increased NDMU’s endowment by 40% and the renovation or construction of several campus facilities.
Her tenure also saw the launch of NDMU Online, a doctoral program in higher education, and the state’s first bachelor’s and master’s programs in art therapy. NDMU also started the state’s first doctorate in occupational therapy at a private institution and the first master’s degree in physician assistant studies at a private institution. She also led the launch of a new School of Integrative Health after a recent merger with the former Maryland University of Integrative Health.
“President Yam has worked 24/7 to put NDMU on a path of success – whether it be in increasing the endowment, creating new programs and schools, creating a new energy and growth in the school through taking the university all-gender, raising our visibility in the city and state and increasing our rankings in so many categories,” said Cathryn Curia ’69, chair of the NDMU Board of Trustees.
“Her goal has always been the financial stability and the growth of Notre Dame, while caring for the campus community and respecting the school’s heritage with the SSNDs,” she said, referring to the School Sisters of Notre Dame, the founding order of the university.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-182385810-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-25 10:56:53.388598

The state has received more than 940 applications for state individual assistance, according to a statement from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Applications are open on the state’s website, through Nov. 9. 
As many storm evacuees left or lost identification or essential documents, the Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health have booths at emergency evacuation shelters in Anchorage to assist with replacements. The Association of Village Council Presidents is offering tribal IDs in the shelters. State caseworkers and a Yup’ik speaking public notary are helping with documentation, the state update said.
Residents must prove they are from the designated disaster area, and provide proof of identification and a mailing address where checks can be mailed. 
As of Thursday night, there were 302 evacuees staying in emergency shelters in Anchorage, with 178 at the Egan Center and 124 at the Alaska Airlines Center. 
The state’s assistance program provides financial assistance for storm damage to homes, vehicles, essential personal property and medical, dental or funeral needs directly related to the disaster. Applicants will be eligible for $21,250 in home repairs and another $21,250 for “other needs.”
The state’s individual assistance program also includes a housing assistance program that provides renters with up to three months and homeowners with 18 months of financial assistance, according to the state’s website. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced Friday that he amended the state’s disaster declaration to waive state fees associated with replacing documents, including licenses and registrations. It also waives late fees for state-administered loan and payment programs.”
Federal disaster assistance approved
On Wednesday, the Trump administration authorized a federal disaster declaration for the Western Alaska storm. The president said that he has authorized an immediate $25 million in federal aid for the state to cover costs as the recovery effort is underway.

Trump also approved the state’s request for federal assistance, including federal individual assistance, public assistance and the hazard mitigation grant program. 
Residents can apply on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website at DisasterAssistance.gov or on the FEMA app. Applicants must file a claim and are required to go through a FEMA inspection to qualify. 
Federal disaster assistance provides up to  $42,500 for home repairs and up to $42,500 for other items.
The U.S. Small Business Administration is also offering low interest loans to small businesses, non-profits and individuals impacted by the storm, to help pay for losses not covered by insurance. Applications can be submitted on their federal website. 
Financial donations pour in for Western Alaska communities
Individual and business donations have come pouring in for the families and communities devastated by ex-Typhoon Halong, including food, supplies, and financial assistance.
The state has a list of resources and links to assistance on its website.
The Western Alaska Disaster Relief Fund has raised $2.5 million to date, said Ashley Ellingson, director of communications with the Alaska Community Foundation, with mostly corporate donors pledging an additional $1.5 million more. She said an advisory committee of regional and state leaders meets at least weekly to consider requests and how to best allocate funding. 
The Alaska Community Foundation has already distributed roughly $575,000 to five organizations: the Association of Village Council Presidents, the Maniilaq Association, the tribal councils of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok — the communities hardest-hit by the storm — and the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Ellingson said that is to ensure funding goes to immediate needs.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)Just as the second and final day of complicated map-drawing expert testimony came to an end late Friday, another twist cropped up in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting legal battle. 
An attorney for Utah’s top election official, the lieutenant governor, told Third District Judge Dianna Gibson that the bid for an indirect initiative to repeal Proposition 4 — the 2018 voter-approved law that calls for an independent redistricting process — had been withdrawn. 
“We are withdrawing this effort prior to initiating a direct initiative effort on the same issue,” Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson wrote in an email to the state’s elections director, Ryan Cowley sent at 4:15 p.m., just as Friday’s evidentiary hearing was wrapping up.
Now, rather than seeking about 70,000 signatures to require the Legislature take an up or down vote on repealing Proposition 4 — an approach the plaintiffs in the state’s anti-gerrymandering lawsuit have challenged in court as unable to undue Proposition 4, which was approved by more than 500,000 votes in 2018 — Axson and other members of the group Utahns for Representative Government are shifting gears. 
Utah lawmakers and plaintiffs accuse each other of gerrymandering with dueling redistricting experts

Instead, they’ve submitted an application to pursue the same method that the group Better Boundaries successfully pursued to get Proposition 4 on the ballot in 2018 and look to repeal that law by another statewide vote. 
In a statement issued Friday evening, Utahns for Representative Government — the group supporting Proposition 4’s repeal — said legal filings opposed to their effort “made it clear that the Lt. Governor’s Office would likely be forced to deny the indirect initiative application.” 
“While we would have preferred to continue under the process provided by law, the time required to defend our rights and appeal flawed judicial decisions would have made it impossible to meet statutory deadlines,” the group said. “The Utah Constitution is clear: the authority to draw congressional districts rests with the people’s elected representatives — not with the courts and not with an unaccountable commission. We again call on all Utahns to stand against judicial overreach and defend the separation of powers outlined in our state constitution.”
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, issued a statement Friday characterizing the withdrawal of the indirect initiative as a victory — for the time being. 
“Once again, political insiders’ attempts to undermine the people’s voice and repeal Proposition 4 have fallen flat, at least for now,” she said. “This is a win in our ongoing fight to give Utahns the reforms they voted for in 2018. Proposition 4 remains the law of the land. Moving forward, we will continue to strongly oppose any and all efforts to undermine fair maps and the ability of voters to choose their politicians.”
Katharine Biele, president of the Utah League of Women Voters, one of the redistricting case’s plaintiffs, told reporters outside Gibson’s courtroom Friday that it was “wise” of Proposition 4’s opponents to abandon their indirect initiative effort — but she warned pursuing a ballot initiative is no easy task. 
“They will find out just how difficult a real initiative is,” she said. “We went through that in 2018, and it was hard.”  
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

In order to successfully get their repeal on the ballot, the GOP group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King, in a statement, called the group’s withdrawal an “embarrassing end to a pathetic last-ditch effort by the Utah GOP to create chaos.” 
“Even with millions of dollars, the backing of Donald Trump, Jr., and support from high-profile elected Utah Republicans, they realized they still didn’t have the competence nor the public support to pull this off,” King said. 
King was referring to Trump Jr., in a post on X earlier this week, urging people to sign up as signature gatherers for the indirect initiative effort. 
“The Utah Republican Party may continue to try to ignore the will of the voters next year using other tricks. But Utahns will continue to see through the corruption, abuse of power, and overall disrespect,” King added. “We will be there to support everyday Utahns when it is time for that particular fight, but today we celebrate another win for voters.” 
The GOP’s strategy shift comes as the state’s Republican leaders continue to protest Gibson’s earlier ruling that determined the 2021 Utah Legislature overstepped when it undid Proposition 4. As a result, she struck down the congressional map lawmakers adopted that year as a product of an unconstitutional process and she ordered a process to pick a “remedial” map in 2026.

In court, the Legislature’s attorneys and the redistricting lawsuit’s plaintiffs have submitted to Gibson their preferred maps — one known as map C that the Legislature advanced in a special session earlier this month, and two submitted by plaintiffs as alternatives. The judge faces a Nov. 10 deadline to pick a map in order for it to be ready in time for the 2026 elections. 
In the courtroom, experts clash over mapping methods
Thursday and Friday, attorneys grilled each other’s redistricting experts while building their cases for why Gibson should pick their preferred maps.
Plaintiffs have argued in court documents that the Legislature’s retained map-drawing experts used methods unfit for a state like Utah that is dominated by the Republican Party while Democrats are concentrated in the densely populated area of Salt Lake County.

The Legislature’s experts, however, defended their methods during hours of testimony and cross examination on Friday — while also questioning the plaintiffs’ experts’ methods and whether they were evaluated for partisan slant with tests that favored allowing a Democratic-leaning district. 
Friday, the Legislature’s attorneys called three experts to testify: Michael Barber, political science professor at Brigham Young University and director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy; Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics; and Jonathan Katz, professor of social sciences and statistics at the California Institute of Technology. 
Trende explained how he drew the Legislature’s map C, saying he based it on the 2021 map’s original boundaries but he sought to correct it to bring it more in line with Proposition 4’s neutral redistricting criteria. 
However, because he said Proposition 4’s language explicitly calls for “measures of partisan symmetry” to be considered among the “best available” scientific methods, he said he felt he had no choice but to use what he sees as the only way to measure partisan symmetry: the partisan bias test.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)
The plaintiffs argue the partisan bias test is among the worst methods to use to measure fairness in a “lopsided” state like Utah where statewide races are won by Republicans with wide margins. 
Trende anticipated there would be controversy over the method — saying he wished Proposition 4’s language didn’t call for it because he knew it would inevitably lead to a challenge and he didn’t want to end up in a courtroom like he has for many other redistricting legal battles. He went as far as calling it a “tragic addendum.”
Plaintiffs’ expert in Utah redistricting case calls Legislature’s map an ‘extreme partisan outlier’

“This is a trainwreck I saw coming the moment I read (Proposition 4),” Trende said. “I think the person who drafted this should be put in a cage and paraded around Salt Lake City.” 
Nevertheless, Trende and another one of the Legislature’s experts, Barber, argued that their analysis of map C compared to thousands of map simulations showed the map wasn’t an “extreme partisan outlier,” as the plaintiffs’ expert Jowei Chen testified Friday. Instead, they argued it passed multiple tests analyzing for partisan fairness, while they said plaintiffs’ maps appeared to be the true outliers. 
Barber said his analysis of Chen’s map simulations showed that “his algorithm is almost always producing a very Democratic district located in the northern half of Salt Lake County.” He said his own simulations produced comparatively more variety while using data that’s publicly available and peer reviewed, while Chen’s isn’t. 
“To me this is a tell-tale sign of a biased algorithm,” Barber said. “The algorithm should be producing a representative sample of maps. We’re seeing a single orientation over and over and over again.”
While the plaintiffs have accused Trende of using a map simulation set that wasn’t programmed to prioritize Proposition 4’s neutral criteria, Trende argued he did his best to follow Proposition 4 while creating map C’s boundaries. 
“I didn’t want to be here (in court),” he said with a laugh. “I was trying to draw maps that would easily comply with at least the structural requirements of Utah law.”

But while cross examining Trende, the plaintiffs’ attorney, Mark Gaber with the Campaign Legal Center, pointed out that multiple times Republican legislators expressed misgivings with accepting maps drawn on a platform called Dave’s Redistricting Tool with a partisan data view turned on. 
During questioning, Trende acknowledged he drew maps using the tool, but he said the political data was “set to a useless composite” with data from 2012 to 2020. 
What’s next?
The judge now has hundreds of pages of court documents with extremely complicated statistical analysis to wade through before picking a new map sometime before Nov. 10. 
She has scheduled another hearing to consider oral arguments in the case on Nov. 4, Election Day. 
That day, the parties are scheduled to debate another complaint filed by the plaintiffs urging the judge to block a law that lawmakers passed alongside their map submission that requires the use of three specific statistical tests that the plaintiffs argue lead to maps that favor Republicans over Democrats. 
Another hearing scheduled for Nov. 5 was previously expected to debate the plaintiff’s legal challenge of the GOP’s indirect initiative, but given that issue is now moot, it’s likely that hearing will be canceled.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks spoke at her annual tailgate fundraiser in Iowa City Oct. 24, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)IOWA CITY — U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, speaking to supporters at a fundraiser Friday, claimed credit for her involvement in the firing of an Oskaloosa teacher over remarks about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Miller-Meeks, speaking at her fifth annual tailgate fundraiser, said there’s “a lot at stake” in the upcoming election.
To show voters why they should support her, she brought up her involvement in a case where an Oskaloosa school teacher was fired after making a controversial social media post in response to Kirk’s assassination. When the post was brought to her attention, Miller-Meeks said she contacted the principal and superintendent of the school district and told them to investigate the situation.
“People need to know that we are working for them, that we are looking out for them, and that we are protecting children,” Miller-Meeks said. “… That teacher was fired after an investigation, after the board met, they had due process, they were terminated. That’s what your congresswoman, who’s working for you, does.
“Our state Legislature decided to have a Center for Intellectual Freedom here at the University of Iowa campus. Your congresswoman made a suggestion that they name that Center of Intellectual Freedom after Charlie Kirk. So it matters who’s in this office, it matters who has this seat.”
‘You are not leverage’
As the federal government shutdown hit day 24, the Iowa Republican also blamed Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the impasse and said Iowans need to elect Republicans to Congress again in 2026. While the U.S. House passed a short-term federal funding bill in September, Senate Democrats have blocked such a measure from passing unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.
Miller-Meeks told supporters about things she doesn’t like, such as “the Chinese Communist Party buying up Iowa farmland” and “California telling us how to raise hogs in Iowa.” She said she also does not like Democrats making demands through a shutdown after they lost control in the 2024 election.
“I don’t like Democrats shutting down the government over something that they could not get done when they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and now they expect us to do their job for them,” Miller-Meeks said. “They expect us to extend something that they couldn’t do themselves.”
Miller-Meeks referenced a comment made by House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, who said Thursday there will be negative impacts from the shutdown. Clark said in an interview with Fox News the shutdown was the only “leverage” available for Democrats to get Republicans to negotiate.
“I mean, shutdowns are terrible and, of course, there will be, you know, families that are going to suffer,” Clark said in the interview. “We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.”
Miller-Meeks said as she meets with Iowans across the state and in D.C., she wants to tell voters, “you are not leverage.”
“That’s disgusting and revolting,” she said. “So we’re going to work hard to open this government. We’re going to work hard to have people have their needs met. And we are not going to do the Democrats’ dirty work for them.”
Miller-Meeks has also taken other steps criticizing Democrats on the impacts of the shutdown, like leading a letter Monday from the all-GOP Iowa U.S. House delegation to Schumer calling for an end to the shutdown, and introducing legislation earlier Friday to allow the U.S. secretary of Agriculture to access emergency funds to maintain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) operations during the shutdown.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota joined Miller-Meeks at the fundraiser Friday, as did fellow Iowa Republicans including U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, running for U.S. Senate in 2026, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra who has an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor, state House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann and Attorney General Brenna Bird.
Emmer told the crowd Democrats were disingenuous by framing the shutdown as being about health care, claiming the minority party wants to provide health care for undocumented immigrants and would remove funding included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation law for rural health care providers.
“It’s not above health care,” Emmer said. “How do we know? Because they filed a counter-proposal in the Senate. You know what? It says, they want us to spend $1.5 trillion more, and they want to put illegals on taxpayer-funded health care, while at the same time gutting the $50 billion fund that we all created in the bill that we passed in July for rural health care. This ain’t about health care.”
Democrats have proposed reversing some cuts made for “lawfully present” immigrants available through federal health care programs. The minority party’s funding proposal would not change federal law that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded health coverage.
The race for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District is expected to be one of the most contentious matches in the 2026 election season, with Cook Political Report rating the district as a “toss-up.” The race for Iowa’s 3rd District represented by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn is also predicted to be competitive in 2026.
Miller-Meeks won her initial election to Congress in the 2020 by a margin of six votes. She won reelection in 2022 and 2024 against Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan, who is running for the seat again in the upcoming election. Miller-Meeks’ margin of victory in 2024 was by 798 votes after Bohannan requested a recount.
Alongside Bohannan, there are two other Democrats running to become the 1st District party nominee: Travis Terrell, a University of Iowa Health Care employee, and Taylor Wettach, a former attorney. Miller-Meeks also faces a primary challenge from David Pautsch, who also ran against her in 2024.
Though Republicans have seen major victories in recent election cycles, the GOP speakers called for Iowa Republican voters at the fundraiser to stay engaged heading into the 2026 election season. Emmer called Miller-Meeks “the key” for Republicans’ victory across the country in 2026.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks winning means we’re winning everything that you’re fighting for in Iowa,” he said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to block President Donald Trump’s plans to deploy National Guard soldiers to Chicago, Trump’s attorneys are arguing that federal personnel are needed to prevent crime.
But an analysis of federal and state crime data by the Alaska Beacon, building upon a larger analysis by Stateline, shows almost all of Trump’s deployments have targeted cities with lower violent crime rates than Anchorage and other places in Alaska.
Among large American cities — those with 250,000 or more residents — Trump has ordered soldiers deployed to just one whose violent crime rate is among the 15 worst in the United States. 
Anchorage’s 2024 violent crime rate, 1,015 per 100,000 residents, is the 15th worst in the United States, according to figures published by the FBI in an annual report.  
Under the FBI’s definitions, violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
When considering Trump-targeted cities, only Memphis, Tennessee, which has a worst-in-the-nation 2024 violent crime rate of 2,501 per 100,000 residents, is worse than Anchorage. 
Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Chicago all have lower crime rates than Anchorage.
They have the 19th, 32nd and 54th highest violent crime rates among large cities, respectively.
Statewide, the FBI tallied 5,392 violent crimes within Alaska in 2024, giving the state an overall violent crime rate of 728 crimes per 100,000 residents. That’s almost exactly the same rate as Los Angeles. 
The Alaska Department of Public Safety has yet to publish its 2024 report on crime within the state of Alaska, but a spokesperson for the department said its report will mirror statistics already published by the FBI in its online data system.
Using those FBI-published statistics and population estimates published by the state of Alaska, Fairbanks had a violent crime rate of 730 per 100,000 residents in 2024, higher than Los Angeles or Chicago. 
That applies only within city limits, because it’s based upon statistics reported by the Fairbanks Police Department, which operates within the city and not in the whole Fairbanks North Star Borough.
In Juneau, which has an almost identical population to Fairbanks city, the violent crime rate in 2024 was 519 per 100,000 residents.
The Bethel Police Department reported 104 violent crimes to the FBI in 2024, enough for that town’s violent crime rate to stand at 1,727 per 100,000 residents, slightly worse than Detroit, which had the third-highest violent crime rate in the nation in 2024.
Within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Wasilla Police Department reported 52 violent crimes in 2024, a rate of 541 — almost exactly Chicago’s rate. The Palmer Police Department tallied 10 violent crimes during the same time period, a rate of 169 per 100,000 residents, the lowest among Alaska towns and cities examined by the Beacon.
The North Slope Borough Police Department reported 63 violent crimes last year, a rate of 595 per 100,000. In Ketchikan, where the police department recorded 32 violent crimes, the rate was 418 per 100,000.
Spokespeople for Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy have repeatedly said that the governor has not requested a crime-fighting National Guard deployment for Alaska and has not approved the use of Alaska National Guardsmen for crime-fighting deployments in other states.
They reiterated those positions on Friday, a day when dozens of Alaska National Guardsmen were actively aiding in relief efforts following the arrival of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska.
Nationally, the state of Alaska has joined other Republican-led states in backing Trump’s claim that he has the legal authority to deploy the National Guard, even in cases when states and local governments oppose the deployment.
In September, Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox signed a brief alongside other Republican-led states in support of Trump’s ability to deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C.
Alaska didn’t sign briefs in support of deployments to Los Angeles, Portland or Chicago.
Asked whether that absence represented a change in viewpoint or a nuance between the rights of states and the District of Columbia, Cox said no — it was simply a matter of timing.
“We have a process to review state amicus briefs and we receive dozens of requests every week, typically with several days to review them and make decisions, but on these two briefs,” he said, referring to ones related to Illinois, “we had less than 24 hours’ notice and not enough time. Had we had more time, we would’ve signed on.”
Meanwhile, former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles joined a bipartisan group of more than a dozen former state governors in arguing against the Trump administration’s deployment to Chicago.
In a friend-of-the-court brief, they wrote that allowing the federal government to deploy soldiers to states for police purposes violates the U.S. Constitution.
“The present deployment of military resources, based on an assertion of nearly unfettered federal authority, is unlawful,” they wrote.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/National-Guard-DC.jpg,,,2025-10-24 21:01:15.727297

(Photo by SageElyse/Getty Images)Instead of getting paid as they normally would on Friday, many of Utah’s federal employees were figuring out how to stretch their budgets for as long as it takes Congress to reopen the government. 
“The anxiety is starting to really rise in a lot of people,” said Robert Lawrence, president of the union representing Ogden’s IRS employees. “They’re starting to wonder, you know, how they’re going to pay their bills, how they’re going to pay their mortgage.” 
Lawrence said many of his colleagues did not get a full paycheck earlier this month and some have applied for unemployment, but those benefits probably won’t meet their needs. The IRS employs about 6,500 people in Ogden, Lawrence estimated, and the majority are furloughed because of the shutdown — unable to work or get paid.

The possibility of layoffs has exacerbated their stress. Roughly 100 were among thousands of U.S. government workers across the country who received notices earlier this month saying they’d be laid off, Lawrence said. A judge temporarily blocked the terminations, which were set to happen in December. 
Lawrence said the shutdown is holding up the agency’s work ahead of the coming tax season, all while it’s still trying to recover from a slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“What makes it so frustrating is that, you know, we have nothing to do with what’s going on in D.C. We have a job to do. We do that job. We do it proudly, and we expect to get paid for it,” Lawrence said. “I’m not siding with either side. Change has to come from both sides.”
Some of the agency’s employees in Ogden are longtime staffers who moved up the ranks, but the majority are getting paid somewhere near $15 per hour, said Lawrence, president of the National Treasury Employees’ Union chapter 67.  
“You can’t support a family on that,” Lawrence said. “So to miss a paycheck is potentially devastating.”

Rangers at Zion National Park are also feeling the pressure of another week without pay, according to the Zion Forever Project, a nonprofit supporting the park and its workers. 
“On a typical day, you would see rangers kind of everywhere, and that’s not the case anymore,” said Tiffany Stouffer, the organization’s development director. “Very few of them are working, and even less of those who are working are working with pay.”
The organization launched a push Friday to raise more money for a fund helping to cover counseling and mental health support for the park’s employees and its own staff. Stouffer said many park rangers fear that they’ll be called back to work when the government reopens, only to be laid off a short time later. 
“These are career professionals with sometimes multiple degrees, or lifetimes of knowledge and experience,” she said. 
At the nonprofit Switchpoint, which operates a food pantry in St. George, spokesperson Zachary Almaguer said four federal employees — two working for public lands agencies — have gotten in touch about food assistance, expressing concern about making ends meet. 
Stouffer fought tears as she thought about Zion employees in similar situations. 
Said Stouffer: “They’re Utahns, they’re part of the fabric of our communities, and they’re suffering.”

Melanie Stansbury, as a state official says NM is ""evaluating the USDA's ever-changing guidance.""","Food bank officials said they intend to increase distribution sites—as they did during the COVID-19-pandemic—in response to lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits expected on Nov. 1, 2025. (Courtesy The Food Depot)Federal and state officials said Friday they are working on a plan to shield 450,000 New Mexicans from pending lost federal food assistance benefits.
The United States Department of Agriculture informed states earlier this month that due to the federal shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program had insufficient funding to run after this month, and ordered states not to submit SNAP recipient info to state vendors.
U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) said an “emergency food plan” is emerging that tasks charitable organizations and schools with counteracting the expected loss of $90 million in SNAP benefits for 250,000 New Mexico households.
“As I understand it, it’s a combination of looking at opportunities to scale up food deliveries through school lunch and breakfast programs, as well as increasing the food supply through our food banks and food pantries,” she said. 
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

She directed reporters at a virtual news conference Friday afternoon to contact state officials for more details.
Late Friday, Jodi McGinnis Porter, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s deputy communications director, told Source New Mexico in an emailed statement that the state is “closely evaluating the USDA’s ever-changing guidance and exploring every available option to maintain food assistance for New Mexicans.”
While she did not provide full details of an emergency food plan, she offered a few more details about what will and won’t happen Nov. 1. 
For example, she said recipients who have existing balances on their electronic benefit cards from previous months can still use their cards on Nov. 1 or after. 
But she said the state is limited in its ability to use its own funds to pay for November SNAP benefits. The $16.6 million lawmakers recently passed during the special legislative session to offset SNAP cuts “cannot be used,” she said, “because most of the funding was appropriated for specific purposes rather than replacing federal SNAP benefits.”
The state is also expediting the delivery of $8 million to food banks the Legislature passed during the special session, she said, but that is only a fraction of the estimated $90 million the benefits are expected to cost, McGinnis Porter noted.
Members of the state’s congressional delegation wrote to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins this week contending the agency could use contingency funds to make up the shortfall. The USDA in a memo on Friday discounted that idea and also said states would not be reimbursed if they funded the benefits themselves.
Stansbury also said Friday that because the USDA’s Oct. 10 order prohibited states from sending recipient information to vendors, “many states” have interpreted the order to mean they can’t use state funds to refill the Electronic Benefit Transfer cards used by SNAP recipients. 
That means, supplemental SNAP funding New Mexico lawmakers passed earlier this month can “flow to our food banks, but it will not be funding that can get loaded on to individual EBT cards,” she said. 
NM food banks say they have no time to prepare for Nov. 1 SNAP stoppage 

To prepare for the loss of SNAP, New Mexico food banks say they are purchasing extra food and gearing up for additional food distributions that resemble those during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stansbury also compared the expected demand on food banks to what they saw in early 2020. 
“I do anticipate this is going to be very similar to the beginning of the pandemic, where you saw thousands of families having to line up at food banks and food pantries to get access to food,” she said. “It is a full scale crisis that the White House is manufacturing that is going to affect millions and millions of children.”
Along with members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Friday joined a group of 23 attorneys general denouncing the impending SNAP halt in a letter to USDA Secretary Rollins.
The letter calls on the USDA to account for any contingency funds it has available, what plans it has for those funds and how states should regard the Oct. 10 letter ordering states not to submit SNAP recipient info to state vendors.
The letter also says states have already taken steps to delay November benefits, “which will significantly harm millions of people who depend on SNAP to put food on the table, including children, seniors, veterans, disabled persons, and other vulnerable individuals struggling to meet their basic food needs.” 
The letter also argues USDA has no legal basis to prohibit states from sending already-calculated November benefits to EBT vendors, and it says contingency funds remain available to keep benefits flowing. 
“It is irresponsible to direct states to withhold this contingency funding, a decision which, if upheld, will devastate and cause irreparable harm to families,” Torrez said in a statement. “My office will do everything in its power to ensure these funds continue to be distributed and keep meals on the table for New Mexicans.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Client-food-basket-Santa-Fe-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 19:57:02.359480

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hundreds gathered outside the federal Whipple Building at Fort Snelling Friday to protest the presence of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who is leading the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants. 
Noem held a press conference to tout the administration’s arrests of immigrants who have committed crimes. She spoke behind a table piled with seized firearms and bags of marijuana, meth and fentanyl. 
Many protesters feared Noem’s presence signaled the beginning of a large-scale immigration enforcement effort like the one launched in Chicago last month.
But Noem’s appearance focused instead on celebrating arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s St. Paul field office.  
“I’m here today to ask all of the people in Minnesota, all of the people in the Midwest and throughout our country, to support your law enforcement officers, to support them and help protect them as they go out and do their job,” Noem said. 
Dozens of clergy members attended the protest, leading demonstrators through songs like “This Little Light of Mine” and “We Shall Not Be Moved.” 
Craig Loya, a bishop at Episcopal Church in Minnesota, preached a message of inclusion.
“As long as I have breath, I will continue to preach and proclaim that diversity makes us stronger and that there is no clearer moral imperative than standing with the immigrant and the outsider, because that is how God has embraced every single one of us,” Loya said.

Protesters demonstrated right up to the Whipple Building’s glass doors, with many holding signs and shouting anti-ICE chants.
“No more Minnesota nice. We won’t want your fascist ICE,” the protesters chanted.
The chants did not reach the windowless room of the Whipple Building where Noem spoke. 
When asked whether President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard or other federal law enforcement to the Twin Cities, Noem said “it’s up to the president.” 
But thousands of newly-trained ICE officers are expected to join field offices in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul, paid for by funding approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July, Noem said.
Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.
Immigration agents detained a roofing crew in St. Paul on Oct. 3. The officers arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to advocates. Some wore masks. 
Asked about the incident, Noem said “our agents always follow exactly what the law is and what the regulation and the protocol is for every single operation that they’re out on, so they are always identifying themselves and making sure that people know who they are.”
A handful of Minnesota Democratic lawmakers also attended the protest, including DFL state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, who said she was at the protest to send a message to Noem that she and ICE weren’t welcome in Minnesota.
“We know a lot of what they do — the point is just fear,” Sencer-Mura said. “Always trying to combat that with love and community is a good way to just show up.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MG_5354-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 19:17:29.934396

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ third-largest school district asked a federal court Friday to let it intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s school voucher program.
In a motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the Little Rock School District also argued that the Educational Freedom Account program hurts public schools by diverting public funds “to support a separate system of private sectarian schools to the detriment of LRSD and other Arkansas public school districts.”
The district’s motion says that “for each student who leaves LRSD for a private school, or who is home schooled, because of the Voucher Program, LRSD loses resources necessary to educate its remaining students.” The district’s enrollment this school year is 18,964, according to the state education department’s website.
The EFA program was created by the LEARNS Act of 2023, a wide-ranging overhaul of the state’s public education laws that also raised annual teacher salaries to a minimum $50,000 and prohibited so-called “indoctrination” of students.
The LRSD motion supports arguments made in the original complaint filed by parents in June that the EFA program violates both the First Amendment’s provision prohibiting establishment of a state religion and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection clause.
The EFA program became available to all students this school year after being phased in two years ago. A recent estimate put the total cost in the 2025-26 school year at $326.1 million, more than the $277.4 million budgeted by the Legislature this spring.
“The provision of such significant sums of public money to support a system of private, mostly sectarian schools, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,” the motion argues.
The voucher program also discriminates against low-income families who can’t pay private school costs, students in rural areas who have no access to private schools and children with disabilities who “are not acceptable to many private schools,” in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the motion adds.

The school district also argues that instead of maintaining a robust system of free public schools as required by the Arkansas constitution, “the state has violated that obligation by creating a separate and competing system of publicly funded private religious schools, and providing vouchers to encourage students to attend those schools.”
In supporting its argument to intervene, the district says it “enrolls, on average, students with greater educational needs than the students in the private, sectarian school [system] supported by the LEARNS Act Voucher Program. LRSD has an interest in this case because the outcome will significantly impact these students and educators.”
“An outcome which allows the state to continue to invest in a separate private school system for more affluent students will inevitably work to the detriment of the constitutionally required free public school system,” the district argues.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, directed the Advocate to a statement issued in June when parents and guardians of public school students — Gwen Faulkenberry, Special Sanders, Anika Whitfield and Kimberly Crutchfield — filed the lawsuit against Sanders, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva, the Arkansas State Board of Education and Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson.
“This suit has no merit. More than 44,000 [now 51,000] students have applied for EFAs for next school year and far-left activists are playing politics with those kids’ futures to try and protect a failed status quo.”
Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said, “We are reviewing the filing and will continue to proudly defend the LEARNS Act.”
The Little Rock district is being represented by Christopher Heller, Khayyam M. Eddings and Liz K. Harris of the Friday, Eldredge & Clark firm in Little Rock.

(Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)As a group of stakeholders and Idaho lawmakers prepare to address the state’s housing issues, a number of priorities have risen to the top: water and sewer infrastructure, incentives for affordable housing, zoning, and the impact on local government of House Bill 389. 
The Idaho Land Use and Housing Study Committee on Friday discussed its priorities for a final report on recommendations to improve housing affordability and availability in the state. The report is expected within the next month or two, and the committee will likely not meet again, according to one of the co-chairs.

The  committee, which is co-chaired by Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, met five times since May to discuss subjects such as high land costs, permitting delays, zoning, building regulations and solutions from other states as it prepares to recommend legislation to address the issue in the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January. 
The group — created through legislation sponsored by Boise Democrat Sen. Ali Rabe — comprises lawmakers, building officials, local government representatives, and developers. 
 Committee members underscore high cost of infrastructure to support housing growth 

Discussion for the group’s top priorities repeatedly emphasized the need for funding for water and sewer infrastructure, so communities can absorb the high growth, especially in smaller communities. 
“Sewer, water infrastructure is massive,” said Trevor Chadwick, of the Association of Idaho Cities and the mayor of Star. “We’ve got several communities just in this valley that are struggling right now.” 
Many Idaho cities must ask voters to approve bonds to pay for water or sewer upgrades, which can be difficult to pass. Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin, of the Idaho Association of Counties, said the requirement to achieve a supermajority of 66.67% of the vote to pass bonds for construction can create hardship when those fail to pass but the need for the service remains. 
Rabe emphasized a need for “gentle density,” to avoid urban sprawl, which she said would cause even more expensive infrastructure investments to expand and maintain. She said less-restrictive zoning that may allow for smaller starter homes on smaller lots and infill in existing lots rather than expanding outside developed city areas. 
Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, also said it was his understanding that infilling in undeveloped or underdeveloped areas within cities that are already attached to water and sewer lines, is less expensive on infrastructure than expanding those services to suburban areas through sprawl. He, Redman, and others on the committee expressed support for expanding the rights of property owners to build accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, which are smaller, independent housing units on the same property as an existing home. 
Chadwick, of the Association for Idaho Cities, said he would caution against giving every property owner the right to create an ADU, as it could add strain on utility systems if too many additional users are added. 
“It’s the amount of sewage and stuff that goes into the system, regardless of where it comes from, it only can handle so much,” Chadwick said. “And so your systems, if you can’t expand those systems, we’re always going to be behind, and we will never be able to service and add the additional housing that we need.” 
City of Boise Building Official Jason Blais said the city’s public works department has not had issues with tying in smaller dwelling units to existing infrastructure. He highlighted that after Boise updated its zoning code in 2023 to allow for more ADUs, the city has seen permits for them go from 30 to 35 a year up to around 80 per year. 
 Many say tax incentives and ‘gap funding’ are needed to complete truly affordable housing 

Some members of the committee, such as Toews, argued that they mostly support free-market solutions to the housing issues. 
Others said that current high costs for land and construction made it impossible for developers to build housing that low and middle-income households could afford. 
“Developers, they build what the market can support, and then they build what’s feasible,” said Caleb Roope, CEO and president of the Eagle-based housing development company Pacific Companies. “… absent incentives, absent support from localities, those kinds of homes just won’t get built.” 
He and other committee members highlighted the state’s Workforce Housing Fund, which was created in 1992 but not funded until 2022, when the Idaho Legislature added $50 million. Rabe said it helped finance 1,200 units across the state. 
She and others expressed support for the state to make another investment in the fund.

Woodward, who also highlighted previous state investments in rural water and sewer infrastructure projects, said the state faced a “different budget picture” this year. In wake of back-to-back years of tax cuts, and increasing use of sales tax revenue, an October state budget report showed Idaho facing a projected $56.6 million deficit by the end of the fiscal year, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Committee members highlighted other ways to make affordable developments more financially feasible, such as property tax incentives or moral obligation bonds, which are tax-exempt government bonds with a moral but not legal obligation to pay back. 
Maupin, of the Idaho Association of Counties, said existing tax breaks for affordable housing came with too many restrictions to make them usable for many projects. 
Jason Kreizenbeck, a lobbyist representing a large workforce housing developer, said the firm plans to bring another version of House Bill 406 — a bill that it proposed during the 2025 session that would amend the property tax exemption for low-income units. The bill did not receive a public hearing. 
 Cities and counties still feeling damage from 2021 property tax bill House Bill 389 

Multiple representatives of city and county government said budgets continued to be hampered by 2021 legislation House Bill 389 — which capped the growth of local governments’ budgets and reduced how much they could collect from taxes related to new construction. The bill was meant to ease the property tax burden on residents. 
Chadwick said as a result of the bill, the Star region’s budget has been limited to a point where it can’t keep up with growth, leading to issues such as an empty fire station that’s been left unstaffed since local fire districts failed to pass levies to pay for the additional fire and emergency personnel needed to keep up with population growth, the Idaho Press reported previously. 
Rabe said that continuing to work on the legislation should remain a priority. 
“We do need to tackle the challenges that House Bill 389 has created for our cities, and not allowing growth to pay for itself,” Rabe said. “I think that has really been what I’ve heard as the root of the problem in all of this related to infrastructure. And I love the ideas that we have here, but I think because of House Bill 389, we are trying to plug holes in a sinking ship, essentially.”

A Bureau of Land Management auction planned for next summer could test the state’s migration policy to an unprecedented degree.
The post ‘Energy dominance’ meets migration: All Wyoming corridors overlap with proposed oil and gas leases appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal auction scheduled for June proposes leasing tracts of all three protected Wyoming migration corridors to oil and gas drilling, and it also opens the door to rigs within a now-unprotected pronghorn corridor that’s eyed for protections of its own. 
The potential for industrial incursion into habitats that prized ungulate populations depend on to reach their seasonal ranges in the Platte, Little Snake and Green River basins comes via the Bureau of Land Management’s lease sale of more than 250,000 acres in Wyoming. It’s a sale that’s now in the early “scoping” phase and could still change, but what’s been proposed is to auction more than five dozen parcels totalling 88,000 acres that overlap the state’s first three deer migration corridors and its in-the-works pronghorn corridor. 
The possibility of well pads and industrial infrastructure on the horizon within Wyoming’s most famous migration paths has environmental advocacy groups calling on the BLM to make responsible leasing decisions. 
“We simply can’t lease and allow development in our big game migration corridors if we want our kids and grandkids to have the same hunting and wildlife viewing opportunities that we’ve enjoyed,” said Julia Stuble, the Wyoming state director for The Wilderness Society.

That’s a premise Steve Degenfelder, a landman for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, disagrees with. He’s seeking to acquire at-issue leases in the Green River Basin that intersect with migration paths used by the Sublette herds of pronghorn and mule deer, but says he intends to use horizontal drilling and existing roads to minimize damage to the corridors.
“Wildlife folks can have their cake and eat it, too,” Degenfelder said. “They can have the activity occur far from these critical spaces and still enjoy the tax revenue.” 
Industry assurances and the potential for lease stipulations down the road haven’t placated groups that lobby on behalf of wildlife and wild places. The sheer number of conflicts with valuable habitat in the lease sale is of “great concern,” and it’s unclear whether BLM will listen to those concerns at a time when the federal government is shut down, said Alec Underwood, conservation director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council. 
“While there are places that are appropriate for oil and gas development, potentially fracturing our iconic big game migration corridors is an affront to all those who value Wyoming’s wildlife,” Underwood said.

The Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming staff were unreachable for an interview. Because of the lapse in appropriations, the agency is only responding to “urgent” media inquiries related to visitor access, safety and essential operations, according to Kristen Peters, a U.S. Department of Interior spokeswoman. 
Underwood’s colleagues at the Wyoming Outdoor Council completed an analysis and compiled maps that show where and how many parcels intersect with designated, identified and known-to-science migration paths. 
The breakdown shows: 

In designated migration paths (those protected by Wyoming’s policy), there are 32 parcels in the lease sale that overlap corridors. Collectively, those parcels encompass 38,727 acres. There are seven parcels totaling 13,749 acres in the Sublette Mule Deer Corridor (AKA, Red Desert to Hoback), three parcels totaling 4,293 acres in the Platte Valley Mule Deer Corridor and 22 parcels totaling 20,685 acres in the Baggs Mule Deer Corridor. 
There are 31 parcels totaling 49,329 acres in the Sublette Pronghorn Corridor, which has been “identified” by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and is in the process of being assessed for designation by Gov. Mark Gordon. Notably, significant overlap occurs in a disputed portion of the pronghorn corridor located east of Farson. 
The Wyoming Outdoor Council also analyzed parcels in the lease sale that bisected migration routes mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey. There were 23 parcels totaling 29,775 acres that overlapped the Shirley Basin Pronghorn migration (12 parcels, 11,896 acres), Elk Mountain pronghorn migration (five parcels, 6,725 acres) and the Wyoming Range mule deer migration (six parcels, 11,154 acres).

In total, BLM’s second-quarter 2026 sale proposes leasing roughly triple the acreage of what’s slated to be offered during upcoming auctions in December and March. The sharp increase in potentially leased ground comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s pledge of “energy dominance” — he even declared October to be “National Energy Dominance Month.”

The federal budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Trump, also requires land managers to make more ground available to oil and gas drilling — at least 50% of all public land nominated by industry, according to the Center for Western Priorities. 
Degenfelder, at Kirkwood Oil and Gas, said that many of the parcels he’s interested in leasing in the Green River Basin, including in the migration corridors, were originally nominated via an “expression of interest” he submitted back in 2021, during the Biden administration. The BLM considered offering some of those leases in 2023, but they never materialized in an auction, he said.
“The Rock Springs Field Office authorized them to be offered, and then the state office reversed that,” Degenfelder said.

Stuble, at The Wilderness Society, said federal land managers should pull back leases that are in the migration corridor. The BLM, she argued, has a “statutory obligation” to inventory the migration routes and design management around them. 
“That has not happened for the vast majority of the corridors that are in this lease sale,” Stuble said. “The bottom line for us is allowing gas rigs and well pads in places where the migrating animals forage and rest puts those herds at risk.” 
If the parcels in migration paths do go forward to auction, there’s a likelihood that at least the 32 tracts in designated routes will be affixed with a migration stipulation. Language would be added at the request of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, according to Will Schultz, the agency’s habitat protection supervisor.
“The lessee or designated operator will be required to work with the BLM and state of Wyoming to take reasonable measures to maintain corridor functionality,” Schultz said.

Schultz is in the process of compiling Game and Fish’s comment letter in response to the BLM lease sale. The state’s migration policy, he said, does not allow for stipulations in the “identified” corridors — like the Sublette Pronghorn herd’s migration.  
“There aren’t the same protections that are afforded to designated routes,” Schultz said. “However … it allows for us to have that opportunity to have a discussion with the operator on voluntary measures that they can take.” 
In an earlier era, Wyoming Game and Fish sought complete lease deferrals when more than 90% of a parcel overlapped with a migration corridor. During a lease sale in the first Trump administration, for example, BLM pulled more than 7,500 acres in the Sublette Mule Deer Migration Corridor path from an auction at the request of the agency. Still, 32 parcels totaling nearly 13,000 acres that overlapped the corridor went to auction and they generated lukewarm interest: Bids topped out at $9 an acre, far below the statewide average of $202 an acre during the 2018 sale.
With Wyoming’s revamped migration policy now in place, the state no longer requests complete deferrals, Schultz said. 
The Bureau of Land Management is accepting feedback on its 2026 second-quarter oil and gas lease sale for Wyoming through Nov. 17. Public comments can be submitted through an online portal available at ePlanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2040967/570.

 “We were hoping that we were gonna be able to get that declaration. It's very hard for a town like ours to pay that kind of money,” said Burke’s town administrator, James Sullivan. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump denies federal disaster aid for Vermont’s July 2025 flooding.","In the past two years, the town of Burke has relied on federal funds to recover from floods, but this year, Burke will be cut off from a key source of that funding.
On July 10, rainfall and flooding significantly damaged public infrastructure in Burke and other towns in Caledonia and Essex counties. In August, Gov. Phil Scott submitted a request to President Donald Trump for a major disaster declaration, citing more than $1.8 million in statewide damages, exceeding the $1.2 million threshold that states need to meet to qualify for a declaration.
But Wednesday night, Trump denied the request. 
A federal disaster declaration would have unlocked Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to reimburse municipalities for 75% of the costs, including debris removal, road and public building repairs, and staff overtime during and after the storm.
The declaration would have also made available funds from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which provides 75% reimbursement for projects that reduce the risk of damage to public infrastructure during future disasters.
Other blue states, Illinois and Maryland, were also denied their requests, while states such as Alaska, Nebraska and North Dakota, and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota, were approved for major disaster declarations.
Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland responded to the President’s decision in a press release saying, “FEMA has a responsibility to weigh the merits of each emergency request objectively. Instead, President Trump and his Administration have politicized disaster relief, and our communities are the ones who will pay the price. While we disagree with both this process and outcome, our resolve is unbroken. We will continue to support Marylanders recovering from these storms, even if Washington won’t.”
Eric Forand, Vermont Emergency Management director with the Department of Public Safety, said the letter from FEMA on Wednesday night didn’t provide any specific reasons about why the funds were denied.
“All we know is that there’s a threshold (of damage costs) that we crossed, but in the end, it is the discretion of the president, so we did submit it, and we were denied,” Forand said.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the federal government’s response “non-political” in a response to VTDigger’s request for comment. 
“The law and regulations require FEMA to review each request closely and consider the unique circumstances of disaster-caused damages as well as state and local capacity. This request was determined that the damage from the event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments to recover,” the spokesperson wrote.
Burke’s town administrator, James Sullivan, said Burke received disaster declarations after the 2023 and 2024 floods.
“We were hoping that we were gonna be able to get that declaration. It’s very hard for a town like ours to pay that kind of money,” he added, explaining that the town had between $400,000 and $500,000 worth of damage to public infrastructure from this year’s flooding.
Now, Sullivan said, the town will work closely with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns and the Northeastern Vermont Development Association to explore other options, but if they can’t find any solution, costs could fall on taxpayers.
Forand said state officials are still evaluating different courses of action and haven’t decided whether to appeal the government’s denial of federal funding.
A recent analysis by the Pew Research Center shows that without federal assistance after the most significant disasters, many states would see their reserves depleted.
Vermont was among the most vulnerable states to federal funding cuts, according to the analysis. The study looked at the highest amount a state received in a single year for disaster aid, then compared it against the state’s reserves. Vermont received its highest tally of disaster aid — more than $421 million —  in 2011, following Tropical Storm Irene, according to Peter Muller, one of the authors of the research. In 2024, the state’s reserves were just slightly more than that, at $465 million. 
The only states with higher aid-to-reserve ratios were Louisiana and Mississippi — which received billions of dollars in funding from the federal government following Hurricane Katrina,  and were therefore considered outliers in Pew’s analysis. 
Muller highlighted that if states have to use those funds for disasters, they would not be able to use them for other unexpected demands. 
“The really important thing to keep in mind is: Those reserves for Vermont, and every other state, are often intended for more than one purpose. They’re not just sitting there waiting for disasters,” he said.

“No new SNAP benefits will be issued for November unless federal guidance changes,” the department said in a press release. 
This move comes more than three weeks into the federal shutdown, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would not tap into its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food assistance next month.
Nearly 400,000 Mississippians receive food assistance through SNAP, and the vast majority are families with children or elderly people. That is about 13% of the population, slightly higher than the 12% nationwide who use SNAP to help buy groceries.
 The Associated Press reported that officials in Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia pledged Thursday to keep food aid flowing to recipients in their states, even if the federal program is stalled next month because of the government shutdown.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services encourages members to use up their current benefits before the end of October to buy shelf-stable foods, such as canned goods. It’s not clear whether SNAP clients will be able to use pre-existing benefits beyond Oct. 31, the department said. 
The department will continue to process new applications. Current enrollees are also reminded to fulfill all requirements to remain eligible. 
New work requirements for SNAP are slated to fall into place next month, as well, as a result of a federal budget law that President Donald Trump signed during the summer. Work requirements already exist, but the law increases the upper age limit on those from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to those previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but parents must have children younger than  14 – down from 18.

But Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New […]","Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, is backing bills to move back dates on Louisiana's 2026 election calendar to allow for a possible U.S. Supreme Court decision that could reshape the state's congressional districts. (Photo by Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A state lawmaker behind the effort to move back Louisiana’s election calendar next year says legal experts have told him there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could rule on a key congressional redistricting case in time for the legislature to draw new boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections.
But Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said there is no firm date or guarantee that justices will issue their decision in time to justify the calendar change he’s proposed. Two identical bills that adjust next year’s election dates have advanced from their respective chambers through two days of a special legislative session on election laws. 
The measures move next year’s primary election schedule back roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 2. 
The qualifying period for the election would be adjusted from Jan. 14-16 to Feb. 11-13 in the bills Beaullieu and Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, have both co-authored.
Beaullieu said these new dates would allow Louisiana to “take advantage of a window of time” that would be created if the Supreme Court rules before the end of the year on Callais v. Louisiana. The case involves a group of white voters who sued the state over a map created in January 2024 with a second majority-Black district in the U.S. House of Representatives out of the state’s six spots. 
The plaintiffs have called into question a portion of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, created and amended over decades to protect the electoral strength of Black citizens. They argue Section 2, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that discriminate based on race, color or membership in a language minority group, now conflicts with the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Those amendments cover, in part, representation in Congress and racial discrimination in voting.
Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, originally supported the version of a congressional map with two Black-majority seats. They now stand with plaintiffs and hope the Supreme Court rejects the current map that includes the 6th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, that covers a winding stretch between Baton Rouge and Shreveport.
Beaullieu, who chairs the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, confirmed he was part of a state contingency that went to Washington. D.C., for the Supreme Court’s Oct. 15 hearings on the Callais case. Justices heard from both parties in March but later asked for further arguments on the Voting Rights Act provisions.  
The Louisiana group also met with Trump administration officials Oct. 15, but Beaullieu said there was no discussion of when the Supreme Court might rule on Callais.  
“There was a visit at the White House, but it was more to make sure that what we were doing was giving our legislature the most flexibility [for a possible redistricting],” Beaullieu said in an interview. “They weren’t saying anything about dates or anything.” 
Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, disputed Beaullieu’s account Friday morning during a House and Governmental Affairs hearing on the election calendar bill. He speculated, without evidence, that Landry already has been given word that the Supreme Court will throw out Louisiana’s current congressional map and will allow lawmakers to draw a new version with one or no majority-Black districts.
“The governor wouldn’t call us in and spend all this money if there wasn’t an opinion coming,” Larvadain said. “I think an opinion has already been written. It just hasn’t been dropped yet.”
Beaullieu stressed to the committee there’s no official forecast when the Callias decision will be issued. He later acknowledged to a reporter the election calendar changes he backs would become pointless if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule before the end of the year.
“We’re not going to second-guess ourselves,” Beaullieu added. “It would be the opposite if we had not had the session, and [justices] come back early enough [with a decision]. Then our hands are tied because we didn’t push the dates back. I think that would be the worst-case scenario, so I think us being proactive is the best thing for the state and the legislature.” 
Black Democrats on the House and Governmental Affairs Committee pressed Beaullieu to explain his optimism for an earlier-than-usual Supreme Court ruling on the Callais case. He said lawyers have told him that because justices have heard two sets of arguments in the case, they could be inclined to rule this year instead of waiting until the spring when they typically issue their decisions after fall arguments. 
Pressed to identify those lawyers, Beaullieu said they included Attorney General Murrill and House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, among others.
“I don’t know that that’s a scientific answer,” Beaullieu said. “That’s just the thoughts that are out there.”
Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, raised concerns with Beaullieu that a Supreme Court decision on Callais, followed soon by an anticipated redistricting session, might run afoul of what’s called the Purcell principle. It comes from a 2006 ruling when justices said election laws should not be changed too close to an election because it could lead to confusion among officials.
First Assistant Secretary of State Catherine Newsom told the committee her agency is prepared to move forward with next year’s elections whether they stay on their current dates or get pushed back one month.
If the legislature does revisit redistricting later this year, the secretary of state would need data from the new maps by mid-January to begin the revised three-day qualifying period Feb. 11.
The Louisiana Senate will meet Saturday and is expected to advance Kleinpeter’s versions of the Beaullieu election calendar bill and a proposal that moves five state constitutional amendments from the April ballot to May. 
The House returns Monday.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden and a group of legislators — including one seeking his job — made rival proposals this week to shift millions in state housing infrastructure funds to other purposes.
On Wednesday, a legislative task force working on property tax reduction advanced 19 ideas that could become legislation this winter. The ideas include taking the roughly $65 million remaining in the state’s housing infrastructure fund and pairing it with money from the state’s budget reserves to provide $500 individual property tax credits to homeowners.
On Friday, Rhoden said he wants to use $30 million of housing infrastructure money to offer interest-free loans of up to $15 million each for expansion projects at the Sioux Falls and Rapid City airports.
“We’ve seen huge increases in travelers coming through these airports,” Rhoden said while making the announcement at the airport in Sioux Falls. “With more gates, more flights, and more destinations, we’ll be able to draw more visitors.” 
The plans require approval from legislators, who will gather in January at the Capitol in Pierre for their annual lawmaking session.

Both plans target the Housing Infrastructure Financing Program, which legislators and Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, created in 2023. They used a mix of state and federal money to create a $200 million fund.
Awards from the program cover up to a third of a developer’s cost for things like roads, water-and-sewer lines, and sidewalks. The fund has supported 83 projects statewide, helping to create 7,360 single-family housing lots and 5,754 apartment or other multi-family units.
Half of the fund went out as grants. About $65 million remains from the other half, devoted to loans.
Rhoden wants to move the $65 million from the housing infrastructure fund to the state’s Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund, known as the REDI Fund. The $30 million could then be loaned to the airports. 
Rhoden did not specify a use for the rest of the money, but in the REDI Fund it would be available for low-interest loans to start-up firms, businesses that are expanding or relocating in South Dakota, and local economic development corporations. REDI Fund loans are awarded by the state Board of Economic Development, whose members are appointed by the governor.
When asked about the shift in purpose for the money, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, Josie Harms, responded with a statement.
“It wouldn’t have been right to use these dollars sooner, before they had the opportunity to be used for housing development — but by now they have,” the statement said. “Most of the original $200 million was invested into housing, and what remains is currently sitting unused; therefore, adding no value to South Dakotans. It’s only right to invest these dollars so that they are actively adding value to our great state.”
Rhoden has not yet formally declared himself a candidate to keep his job next year, but he has published a campaign website and is seeking campaign contributions. 
The idea to use remaining housing infrastructure money for property tax credits is from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, one of several declared candidates for governor in next year’s elections and a co-chairman of the property tax task force.
Rhoden criticized Hansen’s plan Friday. 
“That proposal, quite frankly, has no merit,” Rhoden said, arguing that one-time credits would be a bandage approach to the ongoing problem of rising property taxes.
Hansen responded in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
“Families are getting hammered by high property taxes, and they remain my top priority,” Hansen said. “They need relief now — no more delays, no more excuses, and definitely no more of these budget swaps to fund pet projects.”

Rhoden has his own proposal to lower property taxes by giving counties — which currently can’t impose sales taxes — the option to levy a half-percent sales tax while using the revenue to lower or replace homeowner property taxes.
Meanwhile, an economic development official thinks the remaining housing dollars should stay where they are.
“We’re disappointed that the administration has turned away from the business of investing in housing infrastructure,” said Julie Johnson, an Aberdeen-area lobbyist for various economic development and housing groups. “These are very important funds in the world of housing development across the state.”
Last week, the president and CEO of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Neel Kashkari, told a Rapid City audience that the best thing local governments can do for housing affordability is encourage more home construction.
“Localities need to look at what can you do locally to try to remove some of the barriers that are preventing more supply from coming in,” Kashkari said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0959-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 18:56:50.412075

Summer nuclear site near Fairfield. (Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s state-owned utility is entering negotiations with a New York investment firm to finish partially built nuclear reactors abandoned eight years ago.
Santee Cooper’s governing board voted unanimously Friday to allow the power company’s management team to officially begin negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management on an agreement to restart construction of the failed expansion project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
Brookfield, which boasts a $1 trillion global investment portfolio, was among more than 70 companies to express interest after Santee Cooper put a call out nine months ago. It was a partner on one of 15 proposals Santee Cooper ultimately reviewed.
Negotiations will continue over the next six weeks, CEO Jimmy Staton said. Santee Cooper will name the other partners on the project at a later date.
Santee Cooper did not make public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions.
But Staton said Santee Cooper would use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility. Customers could also benefit from the power the reactors would produce if finished.
“I feel pretty confident that our customers will realize some fairly significant value, both rates wise and otherwise, in this process,” Staton said.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customer continue to pay for on their monthly bills. Those payments could continue, in part or in full, through 2032, depending how much money Santee Cooper can secure for a buy down in any final deal with Brookfield.
If the two companies manage to ink a contract, Staton pledged that Santee Cooper customers will face no new costs associated with the project. All of that will be borne by Brookfield, as well as big tech companies, such as Google or Meta, that could buy the nuclear power a finished plant would generate.
“We’ve protected the rate payers of South Carolina, and quite frankly, I think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear energy gets built here in the United States,” Staton said.
After the firms mothballed the reactors eight years ago, SCE&G’s parent company, SCANA, spiraled into bankruptcy, as did the reactors’ designer, Westinghouse.
Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up SCANA.
Dominion is not part of the deal, so it won’t at all pay down debt saddled to its 800,000 South Carolina customers. They’ll continue to pay over the next 14 years for $2.3 billion worth of debt from the abandoned expansion.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

And it was Santee Cooper’s potential new partner, Brookfield, that took over Westinghouse in 2018.
To restart construction, Santee Cooper and Brookfield will need to find a construction firm. Westinghouse, which remains a part of Brookfield’s investment portfolio, won’t be the builder this time, Staton said.
It will take a year or more of due diligence, licensing and permitting before any construction on the inactive plants can restart, Staton added.
Among the funds Brookfield manages is a portfolio focused on clean energy and decarbonization. Earlier this month, the firm announced it had raised $20 billion for the effort.
The move to restart V.C. Summer follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.
Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.
Staton also pointed to a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which calls on the Department of Energy to prioritize approvals for 10 large-scale nuclear reactors under construction by 2030.
“South Carolina is going to have number one and number two in that process,” Staton said. “You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear in the United States.”
Still, nuclear power projects are expensive and take years to complete.
Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, operated by Southern Co. in Georgia, started construction around the same time as V.C. Summer. Work on the expansion wrapped up last year. Today the site is the nation’s largest nuclear plant, with four reactors.

The proposal outlines 14 short-term initiatives aimed at curbing disorder in the state's largest city.

Gov. Phil Scott released a set of initiatives that he says will help address public safety in Burlington, ranging from increasing law enforcement presence to expanding substance use treatment. 
Details of how the proposals would be rolled out remain under ongoing discussion, officials said Friday, with state and city leaders adding that, despite past tensions, working together and combining resources would be key to the plan’s success.  
The governor announced the steps of the 14-point “short term action plan” in a press release Thursday. 
“I believe this collaborative effort will help Burlington turn the corner, so residents, students, visitors, business owners and their employees feel safe, so they can enjoy all the attributes this historic city has to offer,” Scott said in the announcement. 
He also underscored that the proposals would be put into effect over a three to four month period, with more long-term efforts to come. 
The outline does not go into great detail about many of the proposals — most are laid out in only a sentence. The initiatives also do not include projected cost estimates or provide information about how they would be funded. 
Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, wrote in an email Friday that the plan will be funded “within existing resources.”

It is unclear what the projected price tag for each part of the plan would be and how that would be funded. Wheeler did not immediately respond to a follow-up email requesting more details.
Scott’s announcement comes more than a month after he declared he would develop a plan to address public safety concerns in Burlington. Previously, Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said that Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the Queen City. 
In turn, Jennifer Morrison, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety and Burlington’s former police chief, said at an August press conference with the governor that Burlington was the one that needed to step up. “The city has made their bed, and they are going to have to ask for specifics to help turn the corner,” Morrison said at that time.  
Speaking on the governor’s new plans, Mulvaney-Stanak said Friday that the city is grappling with more complex problems than a municipality could possibly handle on its own. 
She sees homelessness, mental health issues and the opiate crisis as the main “trifecta” of issues the city is grappling with, she said. While those problems are certainly suffered statewide, she said that Burlington has been “the canary in the mine” for some time. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that as the governor’s plans get underway in the coming months, it’s time to start looking at medium and long-term solutions. 
“How do we get to the deeper issues here that underpin a lot of the folks who are truly suffering in the center of all this?” she asked. 
A special court docket
One part of Scott’s plan — the establishment of a special docket aimed at reducing a backlog of cases pending in Chittenden County Superior criminal court — was already announced earlier this month and is now up and running. Its launch came after public defenders saw a large recent uptick in criminal cases in the county over the summer. 
That plan included the governor appointing a special prosecutor, the judiciary assigning a judge, and the defender general’s office naming a lead defense attorney to help move cases of people with five or more cases through the court system. 
A retired judge, Martin Maley, has been specially assigned to preside over the docket, according to Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay. 
Zonay added in an email Friday that the governor’s office has “indicated” it will cover the costs associated with operating the additional courtroom during the 90-day pilot docket period. 
“We project that the additional costs, including a judicial officer, court personnel and security personnel to approximate $150,000,” Zonay wrote. 
Police cooperation
In his latest announcement, Scott said that a number of policing initiatives will accompany the court. He offered state law enforcement resources to assist city police with “foot patrols, marked unit presence, and greater visibility in Burlington,” the announcement said. 
Scott also directed local service providers that work with the Agency of Human Services to use law enforcement “when appropriate for violent and disruptive behaviors in and around their premises.” 
Adam Silverman, a state police spokesperson, referred specific questions about the law enforcement agency’s role in the plan, and how the plan would be funded, to the governor’s office. 
Wheeler, the governor’s spokesperson, stated in an email that the administration would be in “close communication” with Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke “to coordinate the operational details.”
Details of collaboration between city and state police are yet to be determined, Burke said Friday. Burke said he’s meeting soon with the director of the state police and Zach Weight, the special prosecutor, to iron out the details. 
Burke said he doesn’t see Scott’s plan as an “enforcement only” strategy.
“Any notion that enforcement is the only way out of this is completely false, but policing is important,” Burke said. And sometimes police presence and response is necessary to keep people safe, he said. 
Burke doesn’t expect Scott’s plan to change the way his officers police, he said. It really augments resources, he said. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that she’s grateful for the resources in the court system, but that it’s necessary for the court and the police to also be connecting people with the resources they need, rather than just incarcerating them. 
Prison is a “non-solution” — both her Burke share that opinion, Mulvaney-Stanak said. People should only be sentenced to prison if they’re violent or an acute threat to the community, she said. 
Pre-trial supervision
For people who are sentenced to prison, Scott’s plan calls for the corrections department to expand prison substance use treatment as well as the “immediate implementation” of a pre-trial supervision program in Burlington.
Haley Sommer, a corrections department spokesperson, said Friday that the department already provides substance treatment to incarcerated individuals, such as medication assisted treatment. 
The proposal calls for the corrections department to “intensify” substance use treatment in facilities to provide services more like a person would receive in a residential treatment facility available in the community, Sommer said. That would include, Sommer said, increased hours, enhanced assessments and additional types of treatment. 
The pretrial supervision program will build on a pilot program already underway in Essex and Orleans counties, and expand it into Burlington and Chittenden County, according to Sommer.
“It serves those who have been charged with a crime and that are awaiting trial and they are in the community,” Sommer said. 
According to Sommer, the program targets “certain high-risk” people who may have previously violated their conditions of release or have multiple dockets and need more support services as they await resolution of their cases. 
Sommer said money to pay for the pretrial supervision initiative in Burlington would come from funds in the state budget already approved for the previously planned expansion of the program.  
Mulvaney-Stanak said that she and Weight, special prosecutor of the new court, have already noticed a gap in services between when someone is cited for a crime and when they appear in court. “That’s an immediate break in a system that often will push people right back out into the street,” she said. They are considering how to close that gap, she said. 
Scott’s creation of the new court comes at a time when corrections facilities in Vermont are oversubscribed, with male facilities almost 60% above the recommended threshold, according to department data. Sommer said it’s not clear at this point whether the overall plan would lead to an increase in people incarcerated.
“It’s challenging to predict what those numbers will look like,” Sommer said. “We do also have some outlet for sending individuals out of state as we’re currently contracted for around 300 beds, but only have 128 men out of state.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said he would support a state constitutional amendment that would allow the state to redraw its congressional districts to offset partisan gerrymandering in other states.
Weiser, a Democrat who is also running for governor next year, is the first statewide official to support such an idea. He first shared his support during a Thursday interview with 9News. On Friday his campaign announced his position in a statement.
“When states like Texas and North Carolina redraw their maps to stack the deck in favor of Republicans, Colorado must be prepared to respond. If we want to stop this dangerous power grab, we must remove the incentive for these tactics in the first place — that means being ready to act,” he said in the statement.

President Donald Trump has urged Republican-led states to redraw their congressional lines so the party can pick up more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives next year. Texas, Missouri and North Carolina completed that mid-decade redistricting to give Republicans an advantage. California voters will decide on a ballot measure to redraw the state’s maps in November.
“When other states break long established norms and do mid-decade redistricting, Colorado can’t stand idly by and just watch,” Weiser said.
An independent redistricting commission draw congressional maps in Colorado, and the panel redrew the maps for the first time in 2021. Colorado has eight congressional districts, with four represented by Democrats and four represented by Republicans.
A proposed state constitutional amendment for next year’s ballot, however, would give the governor emergency redistricting power to offset “national redistricting imbalances.” That ballot measure has not yet been filed with the secretary of state’s Title Board, but it underwent a review by Legislative Council Staff in September.
Weiser is calling for a “narrowly-drawn” constitutional amendment to allow mid-decade redistricting. The earliest any new maps could be drawn under that amendment would be for the 2028 cycle.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, the other high-profile Democrat running for Colorado governor, said in a statement to Newsline that Democrats need to focus on flipping House seats to put pressure on Trump.
“All options should be on the table to defend our democracy, but changing the maps in 2028 is too late,” he said. “We can take on Republicans like (Rep.) Lauren Boebert and win House seats here in Colorado — from Adams and Weld Counties to the Western Slope and El Paso County.”

Gov. Kelly Armstrong remains steadfast in his refusal to reappoint incumbent Murray Sagsveen. Sens. David Hogue, R-Minot, and Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, adamantly maintain he should be one of the three appointees to minimize turnover on the board. 
“The learning curve for new people on this commission is probably two to three years because it’s a very complex commission,” Hogan said. “I’m concerned about continuity, and that’s part of the reason why I’m hesitant to replace Mr. Sagsveen.”

Hogue and Armstrong believe the Ethics Commission has been trespassing upon executive branch authority and that needs to be addressed. But they differ on whether Sagsveen can be part of the solution. 
Armstrong also said he strongly disagrees with Sagsveen’s assertion in a candidate questionnaire that the Legislature has passed laws to limit the authority of the Ethics Commission, violating the state constitution.
Hogue suggested the committee appoint one candidate to a four-year term to replace Ward Koeser and then continue to work toward a compromise on the remaining two vacancies. Koeser isn’t seeking reappointment.
“I don’t think any one of us would lose any bargaining position if we fill that position today,” Hogue said. 
Armstrong, a Republican, said he prefers to appoint candidates to all three vacancies simultaneously instead of making piecemeal selections. 
“I want the weekend to think about it,” Armstrong said. 
Sagsveen and Koeser continue to serve on the commission until replaced or reappointed by the selection committee even though their terms expired on Aug. 31. Cynthia Lindquist and Ron Goodman’s terms expire in 2027. The fifth seat is vacant following the May death of former Chair Dave Anderson. 
Sagsveen was initially appointed to the commission last September to fill a vacancy after Paul Richard retired. Sagsveen has nearly five decades of experience in state government and has served under multiple Republican leaders. 
The appointment of an ethics commissioner requires the consensus of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader, not a majority vote. 
Armstrong adjourned the meeting after 11 minutes of discussion. No appointments were made. The committee will reconvene early next week. 
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Cathy Bliss, a member of the League of Women Voters who routinely observes Ethics Commission meetings, said she is mystified by the governor’s refusal to reappoint Sagsveen. 
“I was really quite shocked. Apparently I’m still naive at this age,” Bliss said in an interview. 
But she is encouraged by the bipartisanship of Hogue and Hogan who have presented a united front. 
“Take your time. Get it right because this is really important,” Bliss said. “We’re at a critical juncture.”
Ellen Chaffee, one of the private citizens and activists behind the constitutional amendment that created the Ethics Commission, took issue with Armstrong demanding a “reset” from the watchdog agency.
She said the tenor of the discourse around and with the Ethics Commission by other parts of state government needs to change. 
“There’s a certain level of maturity and respect and civility,” Chaffee said. “That’s what needs to be reset.” 
Hogan said after the meeting she is worried about delaying the appointments for too long because the Ethics Commission has been “tentative” about taking action until the new members of the board are appointed.
“I’m not sure if we can get to consensus,” Hogan said.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Freedom of Information Council is arguing against the award of damages in a libel case where the plaintiffs showed no evidence of harm to their reputation.
In June 2021, a Polk County jury awarded $8 million to a Polk County man and his daughter in a defamation case against their neighbor, former Des Moines lawyer Jaysen McCleary. The plaintiffs had alleged McCleary had wrongfully claimed the man sexually molested his own daughter.
The Iowa Court of Appeals reversed that decision when it found the district court erred by denying a trial continuance McCleary had sought for health reasons. The case was remanded to district court for a new trial to assess damages, resulting in the father and daughter being awarded a combined $57,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress, plus $570,000 in punitive damages. The district court then reduced the punitive-damage award to $55,000.
That decision is being appealed and cross-appealed, and this week the Iowa Freedom of Information Council weighed in through a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing that such damages shouldn’t be permitted in libel cases that involve non-media defendants and where there’s been no showing of reputational harm.
“The juries that tried this matter were instructed to assess damages for (McCleary’s) speech,” the council argues in its brief to the court. “So, unlike most any other tort case, plaintiffs’ injury was presumed, and jurors were charged only with calculating how much to give them in damages for libel. Yet the evidence demonstrated these plaintiffs had incurred no injury to reputation. The resultant awards accordingly arose without proof of an otherwise essential element of a defamation claim and provided compensation for hurt feelings only.”
The council argues the two jury awards in the McCleary case contradict the directive of the Iowa Civil Jury Instructions on libel damages, which tell jurors that “damages must be limited to those which naturally result from the defendant’s statement.”
The council argues the district court’s own rulings in the case “establish the irrefutable fact that the plaintiffs did not incur any injury to reputation from the statements they claim defamed them.”
As evidence of that conclusion, the council cites post-trial rulings in which the district court asserted that “there was no evidence that either plaintiff suffered any reputational damage,” and that there was “no testimony that any individual believed” any of the statements made by McCleary.
“The district court made findings and rulings that the record lacked proof of the very essence of a libel action, which is injury to reputation,” the council argues in its brief.
As part of that same brief, the council says it hopes to add a “distinct public policy voice to the debate” on free-speech protection that is “afforded everyday Iowans sued for defamation, especially now that libel per se verdicts in the state regularly surpass the $1 million mark.”
The council argues the district court’s decision — confirming no injury to the plaintiffs’ reputation while endorsing the recovery of damages — “defies logic and offends the widely accepted principle that courts redress injury rather than reward favored litigants with a windfall.”
In its friend-of-the-court brief, the council also notes that it is acting “in support of free speech generally, rather than for or against any speaker or subject.” In fact, the council says it “renounces the conduct of the parties, including how each has used libel law and the judicial system as armaments to wage personal war.”
The council also notes that McCleary unsuccessfully pursued lawsuits against the Des Moines Register, one of its founding members, and former Register reporter Clark Kauffman, now with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, for a series of stories about McCleary’s use of the court system.

The October survey also found that public opinion around Scott’s return-to-office mandates, and his refusal to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., ran clearly along party lines.

The latest University of New Hampshire Green Mountain State Poll results released on Friday indicate that the majority of Vermonters approve of Gov. Phil Scott’s performance in office and want him to run for reelection next year.
The October poll outlined political positioning leading up to next year’s statewide elections, according to professor Andrew Smith, an author of the poll and director of UNH’s Survey Center. It draws on 880 survey responses collected last week, which are weighted according to demographic information from U.S. Census data and recent election results, Smith said.
The governor has remained relatively popular with Democrats and “mitigated some of the anger” from those farther to his right since the presidential election, Smith said. “He’s in a pretty good spot for reelection.”

Over 60% of Vermonters approved of Scott’s work as governor, with 57% to some extent in favor of him running for reelection. Slightly less than half believed he actually deserved to be reelected, the survey said.
Scott’s consistently high standing in polling is particularly noteworthy given the state’s strong blue leanings in other areas of politics, Smith said. The survey found 80% of Democrats and over half of all Vermonters describe Scott as far or slightly to the right of their own views. Yet in a question that allowed poll-takers to say they wanted multiple potential candidates to run, Scott registered only slightly lower support, 47%, among Democrats than the 50% garnered by liberal State Treasurer and rumored gubernatorial hopeful Mike Pieciak. An even lower 38% of Democrats said they wanted State Attorney General Charity Clark — another possible challenger for governor — to run. 
But Scott’s potential Democratic opponents also registered high rates of “don’t know/no opinion” responses to this query. “The major reason for Vermonters’ ambivalence about Pieciak and Clark is they are largely unknown,” the survey authors observed.
For more than 70% of Republicans, Scott sat far or slightly to their left. Just 20% of all Vermonters thought that Scott’s politics are “close to (their) own views,” the survey estimated.

U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, I-Vt., continued to demonstrate strong appeal among the state’s Democrats, with just over half the state saying she deserves reelection, according to the survey.
Mark Coester, a Republican who ran against Balint in 2024, has filed to repeat his challenge next year. Just 6% of Vermonters had a favorable opinion of Coester, and more than three-quarters didn’t know enough about him to say, the survey found.
The survey also had several questions about current state policy decisions, determined by taking a “look at what issues are in the news, what people are paying attention to,” Smith said.
The poll asked respondents about the Scott administration’s much-discussed return-to-office plan for state employees, which has drawn pushback from the Vermont State Employees Association, among others. Overall, 51% of Vermonters supported the policy to some extent, with 13% remaining neutral, the survey found.
But public opinion on the governor’s policy ran heavily along party lines — 80% of Republicans and 64% of Independents strongly or somewhat supported the measure, compared with just a third of Democrats. 
The governor’s refusal to send Vermont National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. at the request of President Donald Trump was met with relative popularity across the state, Friday’s poll said. The move was opposed to some degree by 70% of Republicans, but affirmed by 98% of Democrats. With all responses combined, 72% of all Vermonters approved of the decision, the survey found.

(USDA photo / Preston Keres)Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, as well as all four members of the state’s federal delegation signed on to a letter last month claiming American Prairie’s bison restoration project is at odds with the state’s economy.
The five men sent the letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota. The Interior Department holds decision-making power over grazing rights on Bureau of Land Management land, which under former President Joe Biden were granted to American Prairie in 2022. 
The state, along with livestock industry groups, appealed the federal decision. Some ranchers have also expressed concern about added costs of having bison near their cattle, including fears of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can spread between the animals. 
“For us, a decision in favor of APR will re-shape the entire landscape of our state,” the letter reads. “Montana’s most profitable economic industry, for decades, has been agriculture. Agriculture drives our economy, sustains our small rural towns, and is the cultural epicenter of our state.”
While there’s no question agriculture is a cultural hallmark of the state, as a percentage of the state’s real gross domestic product, the industry ranked 12th in 2022. That year, Montana generated around $4.6 billion in agricultural cash receipts.
The letter goes on to argue removing “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production will harm the state and allowing American Prairie those grazing rights “threatens the economic vitality of our most important industry.”
American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana and owns more than 500,000 acres in the state. They own and manage 900 head of bison across 46,000 acres. The organization leases much of its land to cattle producers, supporting about 7,000 head and 25 ranchers, the organization spokesperson Pete Geddes said in a statement. There are almost a half million cattle in the seven counties they work, he added. Including calves, there are about 2.1 million head of cattle in the state.
“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” Geddes said. “American Prairie has little influence on the long-term demographic and economic trends in Central Montana. Extended drought, market fluctuations, international trade policies, personal family decisions, and global integrated agricultural markets have much larger impacts.”
Geddes went on to say that since 2020, the organization has paid $7 million in payroll, supporting 23 local jobs in Fergus and Phillips Counties, which infused $17 million into those economies, he said. They’ve also paid $877,000 in property taxes and $345,000 to ranchers participating in a wildlife abundance program, he added.
 
Some ranchers, including Gilles Stockton, an author and former president of the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, have other concerns. 
“If you’re ranching in a brucellosis designated area, which they have in southwestern Montana, it’s hugely expensive,” Stockton said. “And it’s doubly expensive if one of your cows happens to become brucellosis positive.”
Some elk and about 60% of female bison in Yellowstone National Park test positive for brucellosis, a disease that attacks the reproductive system and causes abortions in pregnant cattle, elk, and bison. It’s a nonnative disease to the area, brought into Yellowstone by cattle in the 1900s and can also cause sickness in humans, though human infection is uncommon and the state hasn’t reported an official case since 2017.
“One of the primary mechanisms of historical transmission to people is through the milk, but pasteurization has made that a nearly obsolete pathway,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, State Veterinarian, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “In the 1930s and ’40s, here in the United States, we had a much higher incidence of brucellosis in our cattle herds all across the country, and they started the national brucellosis eradication program.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has what’s called Brucellosis Class Free status, a tool used to maintain compliance so infected animals aren’t being moved around or consumed. 
Montana has a “Designated Surveillance Area” for the disease in southwestern Montana — stretching from Dillon to past Livingston, and down to Gardiner and the Wyoming and Idaho borders. 
Those borders are built through a partnership with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Szymanski said. FWP will go out, capture, tag and test elk and track their movement. Park County and Madison County elk have tested positive for brucellosis, she said. 
That said, Montana is considered brucellosis free.
“The only population of infected animals in Montana is Yellowstone National Park, bison or elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area, we have a couple of livestock herds that are under quarantine for past detections, but any other domestic bison or cattle herd in the state of Montana is considered to be free of brucellosis,” Szymanski said. “That includes tribal populations of bison, APR, bison, people should not be concerned about those animals because of potential disease risk.”
About 100,000 brucellosis tests are administered in that area each year to keep the state’s class free status, according to the Montana Department of Livestock. Cattle vaccinations do have hurdles and have to be performed by a licensed veterinarian. 
“If a human accidentally injected themselves with it, that it would make them kind of substantially sick,” Szymanski said.
That costs about $630,000 per year, according to the agency. Losing the status would incur even more testing costs by places that receive bison and cattle from the state.
“Loss of Class Free status would lead to required testing of livestock exported from anywhere in the State (not just southwest Montana) and cost the livestock producers millions of dollars for testing as well as revenue from lost sales due to a negative stigma,” a Department of Livestock information sheet reads.
American Prairie tests their animals regularly, Geddes said, and brucellosis is not present in their bison.
 
Grazing permits have also been a source of contention for American Prairie, and the letter states the organization is violating federal law.
The letter mentions the Taylor Grazing Act, legislation dating back to 1934 that created stipulations for grazing cattle and eventually led to the creation of the Bureau of Land Management. 
Challenges to the Bureau of Land Management over American Prairie grazing their bison say the act doesn’t allow for conservation grazing. American Prairie asserts that’s not true and Geddes said nowhere in Taylor Grazing Act does it limit grazing permits to production livestock. 
“The BLM is authorized to issue grazing permits to ‘stock owners.’ American Prairie qualifies as both a ‘stock owner’ and ‘engaged in the livestock business.’  AP bison are livestock and we are operating as a non-profit business,” Geddes said. “American Prairie’s primary purpose for obtaining grazing permits is for grazing livestock.”
One of American Prairie’s goals is returning the land to a state more similar to when hundreds of thousands of bison roamed free before colonization and westward expansion.
The Taylor Grazing Act was in part intended to preserve and protect that same grassland, Stockton said, who feels ranchers have done a pretty good job of that.
“The results of that is that we were able to take land that had been really badly overused and restore it across eastern Montana,” Stockton said. “So, you know, the grasslands that you have in eastern Montana are really in the best shapes that they’ve ever been.”
Stockton ranches near Grass Range, is close to American Prairie holdings and feels the Bureau of Land Management overstepped their authority. There’s frustrations with who gets to graze when, fencing problems — keeping cattle away from bison, in a ranchers eyes — and costs associated with vaccinations if brucellosis does spread further.
But, even then, other concerns for Stockton trump issues with the bison nonprofit.
“We got a feeling that the APR, when they moved in here, they were at war with our culture, I guess, our communities and our cultures,” Stockton said. “But the fact of the matter is that in terms of actual impact, say, for me, personally, I’ve got more trouble with my billionaire neighbors.”

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)State Senate President Cameron Henry said Friday that he does not believe the National Guard needs to be deployed in New Orleans, but he can see a need for it in Baton Rouge.
“My thought is not to have them come to New Orleans because we have State Police there and they are doing a good job,” Henry, a Republican, said during an interview with the LSU Manship School News Service.
The New Orleans Police Department announced a 20% overall decrease in violent crime incidents so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Despite this decrease, President Donald Trump has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has asked the Pentagon to send 1,000 National Guard members to fight crime in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport. 
Henry, who represents parts of Jefferson and Orleans parishes, believes the National Guard should be sent elsewhere. 
“Downtown Baton Rouge has a significant homeless population problem,” Henry stated. “Though the National Guard can’t do anything about the homeless population, what they can do something about is the fights and arguments that the homeless are getting into on the street.” 
He adds that Baton Rouge brings in a lot of out-of-state guests for LSU football games. The money from tourists is necessary to continue to fund programs and services that Louisiana residents need.
“To have a group of homeless people fighting in the middle of the street is not a good message for anyone,” Henry said.
Last month, Landry also addressed the homelessness problem during an interview on Unfiltered With Kiran.
“I think that (majority) of the homeless population is really a group of mentally unstable people that need some institutional care,” Landry said. “Another 10% are, quite frankly, a bunch of criminals that use the homeless population to basically camouflage or to carry out their illegal drug activity, their human trafficking. They prey on those people. And it really is inhumane, and it doesn’t do us any good to have people out there.”
The Pentagon has not responded to Landry’s request. Political leaders in New Orleans, which depends on tourism, have voiced their opposition to having guard troops in their city. 
“The National Guard actually doesn’t help toward crime reduction,” said New Orleans Mayor-Elect Helena Moreno during a debate on Sept. 16. She believes that if federal resources were to be used in New Orleans, then the city’s police chief and local leadership should be consulted as to what the city needs. 
Landry sent his request to the Pentagon in late September, leaving the state legislature without any answers. 
“Since he mentioned that, we haven’t heard anything from anybody about it,” Henry states.
While the state continues to wait for a response, there are no current plans for deploying the National Guard into these cities.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Fall yard work and maintenance can be a key time to remove and prevent the spread of invasive species and diseases, according to guidance from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 
Invasive species like bush honeysuckle are easy to spot and yank out during the fall and funguses like oak wilt can be best managed by pruning during cooler temperatures. Iowans should also be on the lookout for things like zebra mussels as they pull boats and other equipment out of the water.
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship confirmed Friday that the invasive spotted lanternfly has been identified in Iowa. IDALS urged Iowans to keep an eye out for the insects that can be destructive to vineyards, orchards and forests.

These Asian-native insects like to cluster on the trunks of their favorite food, tree of heaven. The lanternflies have brown outer wings with dark spots and bright red and black inside wings that can be seen when the lanternflies open their wings. In nymph form, the lanternflies are black with white spots and turn red as they get older, according to photos from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
The insects excrete a sticky “honeydew” substance that can be seen near the plants that a colony has infected. They also create spots of mold that look like soot along the plant and its fruit. As nymphs, the insects gather in large clusters on a plant, which can make them easy to spot.
While the insect prefers tree of heaven, which IDALS said is common in alleyways, unkept urban areas and fence rows, they can feast on around 70 plant species. 
The spotted lanternfly was introduced in Pennsylvania in 2014 and is now present in 20 states. The insect was seen and confirmed in Des Moines County in September, but state entomologists have not seen signs of ongoing infestation in the area. 
IDALS encourages Iowans who identify the spotted lanternfly to contact IDALS at (515) 725-1470, Entomology@IowaAgriculture.gov or their local Iowa State University extension office. 
When bringing outdoor equipment inside, or transporting in the fall and winter, APHIS recommends scanning the items for “egg masses,” which look like smears of mud. These masses should be crushed and scraped into a sealable plastic bag and then thrown away to prevent the spread of spotted lanternfly.

Clean boats and water equipment for zebra mussels 
Boats, trailers, docks and lifts in Iowa’s lakes and rivers should be thoroughly checked and scrubbed down for zebra mussels before being stored for winter, DNR advises. 
DNR’s Aquatic Invasive Species Coordinator Kim Bogenschutz said the winterization process is “a great time” to check for new infestations. 
“As you bring each item out of the water, visually inspect areas that have been submerged for months,” Bogenschutz said in a news release from DNR. “Juvenile zebra mussels should be visible this time of year, but also run your hand over smooth surfaces to check for very small juvenile zebra mussels that feel like sandpaper.”

Zebra mussels are expert hitchhikers, which is why boat owners are instructed to clean, drain and dry all of their equipment before leaving a water body. Equipment like bait buckets should also be emptied and cleaned. According to DNR, it is also illegal to introduce any live fish, except for hooked bait, into public waters.
Zebra mussels, once introduced to a water body, can build up dense clusters, increase algal blooms and interfere with the aquatic food chain. 
DNR has confirmed the presence of zebra mussels in nearly 20 Iowa lakes and nine rivers. Most recently, the department found the mussels in Saylorville Lake. 
Pruners, herbicide and rakes 
As most plants and leaves turn brown in the cooler months, the plants that keep their leaves a bit longer tend to pop out of the landscape. 
DNR said this is the case with bush honeysuckle, a deciduous tree native to Eurasia that will outcompete Iowa native plants in a landscape and is therefore considered invasive. 
Bush honeysuckle plants will hold their leaves well into November, while native varieties’ leaves will drop off. The bush honeysuckle can also be identified by breaking off an older stem. According to DNR, bush varieties will have a hollow, brown core while native varieties will be solid. 
Smaller plants can be pulled out, while more substantial growths of bush honeysuckle will need to be chopped at the roots, or cut near the base and hit with an herbicide solution. 
Removing bush honeysuckle:



Glossy buckthorn is also easy to spot in the cooler months when surrounding vegetation drops its leaves. This small tree or shrub has a brown-gray bark with lighter colored pores and a bright yellow and orange sapwood, the wood just inside the bark. 
These plants can similarly outcompete native species and cause shaded forest floors where other plants have difficulty surviving. According to Iowa State University, the plants are also a host to soybean aphids. 
Iowans can remove glossy buckthorn by chopping it at the base of the plant and coating the exposed stem with herbicide, or by coating the lower 12 to 18 inches of the stem with an herbicide. If the herbicide is dripping off of the plant, it has been over applied, which can be damaging to the surrounding environment. 
Identifying and removing buckthorn: 



DNR also recommends pruning oak trees during colder temperatures to prevent the spread of oak wilt, a fungus that can cause oak trees to wilt and eventually die. 
Tivon Feeley with DNR’s forest health program said pruning outside of the oak tree’s growing season is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease. 
Black oak, pin oak, and red oak trees are most susceptible to the fungus and will typically die within the same season they are infected, according to DNR. White and bur oak varieties can live with the fungus for a number of years before the disease takes over. 
Open wounds in the tree during the growing season can easily be infected by small beetles that carry the fungus spores from one tree to another, which is why DNR recommends pruning outside of the growing season. 
“It’s best to wait until after Oct. 15 to start pruning oak trees,” Feeley said in a news release. “You can prune your oaks all winter long with the goal to stop pruning by March 1.”
Trees can also be infected by root grafts that connect to nearby, infected trees. 
Infected trees will have leaves that bronze along their outer margins and defoliation will begin at the top of the tree. 
Pruning trees and dealing with invasive species in the yard might sound like a lot of work, but DNR said these chores could replace one of the most dreaded fall activities: raking and bagging leaves. 
According to the department, leaving some leaves and yard waste in strategic areas can provide insulation for trees and wildlife and benefit the soil. 
A newsletter from DNR suggested leaving an unmown area of the yard, away from the house, to collect leaves and branches that will provide shelter for critters during the winter. As the leaves sit there, they will break down into a loam that can be beneficial for flower beds or planters come spring.

The initial examination by the Bolivar County coroner and the autopsy completed by the Mississippi medical examiner’s office concluded the death of the 21-year-old Black man was a suicide, and no foul play occurred.
The independent autopsy, conducted later, was paid for by civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick, a former NFL quarterback.

Reed’s body was found hanging in a tree. Some members of his family and activists say they believe he was lynched, and they point to Mississippi’s racist history of lynchings of Black people.
Jeremy Marquell Bridges, an activist from Alabama, said he’s been in recent contact with Reed’s mother, Sophia, and Ben Crump, a nationally prominent attorney representing Reed’s family.
Bridges said this week that Crump needed more time to complete a reenactment as part of the independent investigation. Crump did not specify when that would be complete.
Bridges said the independent investigation revealed injuries sustained from a recent attack by white male students, but he did not provide any proof to Mississippi Today as of Friday.
Delta State University confirmed that Reed had listed his grandmother, Sharon Candy Tillman, as his emergency contact. Tillman said she is waiting to see what the independent autopsy says about claims that Bridges and others are making. 
In an interview with The Chicago Crusader, Bridges said preliminary findings from the independent autopsy alleged that Reed lacked significant bruising around the neck consistent with a suicide by hanging. Bridges also claimed to Mississippi Today that the state crime lab was late supplying Reed’s organs and X-ray imagery to Nebraska pathologist Dr. Matthias Okoye, who the Reed family retained to conduct the independent autopsy.
On Oct. 16, Mississippi Today reached out to Bridges to ask for proof of these claims. Bridges had also claimed that Reed had defended a Black female student who was harassed by white students, and that the buckle was missing from the belt that hung him.
Bridges was unable to provide proof, but he and a member of the Reed family said they were expecting the independent autopsy last week.
Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin did not address Bridges’ claims that Reed’s organs were delivered late to Okyoe, but confirmed the funeral home had them as of Oct. 17, she wrote in an email to Mississippi Today.
Reed’s funeral was held at Abundant Life Assembly church in his hometown of Grenada on Sept. 27. 
Reed’s mother joined members of the New Black Panthers Party at a protest Oct. 18 on the Delta State campus in Cleveland. They alleged that his death was the result of a lynching. They repeated claims that Reed suffered “blunt force trauma to the back of the head,” which was not found in the coroner’s examination or the autopsy completed by the Mississippi medical examiner’s office.

Rumors have swirled online in the weeks since Reed’s death with videos and posts on social media sites like TikTok and Instagram echoing the allegation that he was beaten before his hanging. Some garnered more than 130,000 likes.
One TikTok user with nearly 30,000 followers removed his September video echoing many of the allegations surrounding Reed’s case. He attributed his decision to a Facebook post by Tillman, Reed’s grandmother. She clarified that the second autopsy was not yet released – and the initial findings have not yet been substantiated.
“I don’t usually respond to social media, but I’m tired,” Tillman wrote in an Oct. 3 Facebook post.
Security footage from campus is still with law enforcement agencies and can’t be shared due to the active nature of the investigation, according to the university.

Ron DeSantis on Friday confirmed that the Hillsborough County state Senate seat that has been vacant since he appointed Republican Jay Collins to be lieutenant governor will likely not have representation during the regular 2026 legislative session.
The governor announced that the primary election for the Senate District 14 seat will take place on Jan. 13, 2026.  The general election will take place on March 24, 2026.
That’s 11 days after the 2026 Florida legislative session is scheduled to end. The session is slated to begin on Jan. 13 and end on March 13. 
He announced those same election dates for the House District 87 seat in Palm Beach County, vacated when he appointed Republican Mike Caruso in August to serve as clerk of the circuit court and comptroller for Palm Beach County.
DeSantis’ delay in calling an election date in the SD 14 seat led the ACLU of Florida to file a lawsuit in a court in Leon County on Sept. 30, contending the governor had violated his duty under the Florida Constitution and state law. 
The lawsuit noted that, in more than 25 instances, the governor took fewer than five days to call for an election upon a vacancy in a congressional or legislative seat. When then-GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia resigned from his Senate District 11 seat on July 18 after DeSantis named him chief financial officer, the governor took just four days to call a special election for that seat.
SD 14 was considered a swing seat in the 2022 election, but Collins defeated Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz by nearly 10 points. Caruso won re-election to the HD 87 seat by 19 points in 2024.
Among the Republican candidates rumored to be considering a run for the SD 14 seat are former Rep. Shawn Harrison along with HD 65 Rep. Karen Gonzalez Pittman and Melanie Griffin, now secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
Democrat Brian Nathan, a Navy veteran and union leader, has already filed to run for the seat.

,Kansas Reflector,2025-10-24 21:30:59+00:00,Kansas Reflector,Kansas Supreme Court delves into implications of a slightly askew license plate,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/10/24/kansas-supreme-court-delves-into-implications-of-a-slightly-askew-license-plate/,Kansas Supreme Court issues opinion justifying law enforcement's search of a vehicle as it explores a range of cases raising constitutional issues.,"The Kansas Supreme Court affirms the conviction of a person arrested in a 2021 traffic stop in Jackson County that was predicated on officers observing an allegedly unsecure license plate. This photograph of the tag admitted into evidence, which is held by one bolt and leaning to the right, is useful in digesting constitutional question raised in the case. (Submitted)TOPEKA — The Jackson County traffic stop at 3:30 a.m. Aug. 25, 2021, prompting arrest of passenger Tashara Yeargin-Charles, was an unlikely route to a divided decision by the Kansas Supreme Court on constitutional interpretation of reasonable searches and seizures.
Yeargin-Charles, who engaged in peculiar conduct at the scene along U.S. 75, sought a place in the Supreme Court’s docket to suppress evidence and reverse her district court convictions for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia, interference with law enforcement and transportation of an open liquor container.
A Supreme Court majority considering the appeal rejected her constitutional claims but took the opportunity to further define boundaries on roadside behavior by Kansas law enforcement agencies.
The decision written by Justice Melissa Standridge affirmed Yeargin-Charles’ guilt. In 2024, the Kansas Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion.
Standridge wrote the majority was convinced state law mandated a Kansas license plate had to be securely fastened to the vehicle, positioned at least 12 inches from the ground and clearly visible and legible. The opinion says Jackson County Deputy Justin Dobler and Sergeant Travis DeBarge made a constitutional stop after observing the plate on the Yeargin-Charles vehicle sagged to the right.
“Upon review, we find substantial competent evidence supports the factual underpinnings of the district court’s conclusion that Deputy Dobler had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle for a suspected violation,” her opinion said.
Standridge pointed to officers’ testimony that the plate was “loosely secured by a bolt or a screw on the left side in the manufacturer’s hole and was tilted downwards to the right,” the tag was “not secured by anything” on the opposite end and the plate was visibly “flapping in the wind.”
The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Traffic stops have been determined to be constitutionally permissible when law enforcement officers had facts supporting reasonable suspicion someone was committing, had committed or was about to commit a crime.
 
Dissent on hanging tag
Justice Caleb Stegall, in a dissent joined by Justices Eric Rosen and K.J. Wall, said the majority chose not to adhere to a “strict reading” of Kansas statute.
Each word of K.S.A. 8-133(c) should be considered, Stegall wrote, because the case hinged on whether the tag on the Honda carrying Yeargin-Charles was “flapping” as officers claimed or “swinging” in terms of what state law banned.
Stegall argued state law articulated a vehicle license plate had to be “securely fastened … to prevent the plate from swinging.” He said Kansas courts had an duty to conclude a Kansas plate was in violation of state law only when it was observed swinging.
The Supreme Court recently adhered to strict reading of state law to decide Beck v. State, which involved determining whether obstruction of the state name on a Kansas license plate justified a traffic stop. The Supreme Court reversed lower courts and rejected the claim that Geary County officers had reasonable suspicion to make a stop because the state name wasn’t legible. In that case, the Supreme Court said the traffic stop was forbidden because state law addressed only visibility of the plate’s alphanumeric display and registration decal.
Stegall said the majority’s reasoning in Kansas v. Tashara D. Yeargin-Charles conflicted with the approach to Beck v. State. He said state law defined the degree to which a license tag had to be fastened by emphasizing the connection must prevent swinging.
Jackson County law enforcement officers testified the plate was flapping — not swinging.
“One does not need to be a legal scholar or even dissect these dictionary definitions to understand that flapping and shaking are not factually identical terms to swinging,” Stegall wrote. “We abandon our duty of independent review when we simply defer to an officer’s testimony about what counts as secure. Is a plate with two bolts secure if an officer thinks it isn’t?”
In Standridge’s majority opinion, she said dissenting justices focused narrowly on the phrase in state law requiring motorists “to prevent the plate from swinging” and overlooked broader requirements that plates had to be “securely fastened.”
“Even if we were to accept the dissent’s flawed interpretation — that a license plate meeting all other requirements violates K.S.A. 8-133(c) only when it is actually swinging — the touchstone of our analysis is whether it was reasonable for the officer to think the law was being broken, not technical perfection in statutory parsing,” she said.
 
Peach vodka and a joint
In the Court of Appeals decision affirming Yeargin-Charles’ convictions, judges offered details about the Jackson county traffic stop.
DeBarge observed an open container of alcohol inside the vehicle and instructed the three occupants to exit so officers could search the vehicle. Dobler examined Yeargin-Charles’ purse and found an open bottle of peach vodka, a marijuana joint and a pipe with burnt meth residue.
While the purse was being searched, the Court of Appeals said, Yeargino-Charles dropped to the ground and claimed she was about to give birth. As medical staff arrived, Yeargin-Charles was observed “screaming, farting and trying to force herself to throw up.”
Yeargin-Charles also informed the Jackson County officers that she had COVID-19 and was a paranoid schizophrenic. She was transported to a Topeka hospital, where medical staff reported she wasn’t pregnant.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Supreme-Court-case-tag-search.png,,,2025-10-24 18:02:08.674927

League of Women Voters hosted Mark Gordon, who fielded questions about everything from new property tax law impacts to the well-publicized beef between him and Secretary of State Chuck Gray.
The post Governor talks election bill flood, eroding civility and tyranny at Lander town hall appeared first on WyoFile .","Shortly after Mark Gordon became Wyoming’s governor, he bought a house on a handshake deal. 
“There was no contract or anything,” Gordon told a crowd gathered in a Lander hotel Thursday afternoon. “[We] just came to an agreement. Everything he said he was going to do, he did. Everything I said I was going to do, I did. 
“That’s the state I grew up in.”
But that implicit trust and sense of civility, Gordon said, has eroded in recent years, at least in government. Election attack ads, public name-calling and refusals to participate in public debates are all examples of shifting norms of Wyoming politics. 
“I think we have lost a sense of decorum,” Gordon said. “I think that’s harmful, because now meetings where the important topics are being discussed, they kind of devolve into spectacle as opposed to principled conversation about what the right thing to do is and listening to one another.”
Civility was among the topics Gordon spoke to during the town hall. The League of Women Voters event presented the governor with a series of questions about Wyoming’s political atmosphere and challenges.
Over the one-hour conversation, Gordon addressed the definition of tyranny, cited the U.S. Constitution, talked about the value of serving in office and framed answers in the context that as a conservative, he believes in small government.
The event offered insights into the governor’s priorities and beliefs as he heads into the final year of his term. 
Election integrity 
Moderators kicked the event off with the topic of election integrity, which Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus have made a priority despite few documented cases of voter fraud in the state. 
“Governor, does Wyoming have a voter election fraud problem?” Moderator Steff Kessler asked.

“I have consistently said that the people that Wyoming folks elect to be their clerks … do a very credible job,” Gordon said. “And I consistently have maintained that we can always improve what we’re doing. But in terms of a lot of fraud, I don’t see it.”
Wyoming’s constitution put the power to manage elections at the local level, which is where Gordon thinks it belongs. “We have a system that works,” he said, and one that includes provisions for examining anomalies and detecting fraud. 
Moderators then asked about the wave of election-related legislation introduced in the 2025 Legislature — which signifies that lawmakers are concerned about the security of Wyoming elections. A slate of election-related draft bills are also expected to dominate an upcoming legislative meeting Nov. 3-4. 
“Can you help us understand why the Legislature is treating our county governments as if they are untrustworthy and incapable, requiring state oversight in an intervention?” Moderator Linda Barton asked. 
Gordon reiterated his beliefs about the system working and opportunities for improvements. 
“Now, is there overkill?” he asked. “Perhaps. I mean, if you look at the Legislature today, they all got there by a supposedly flawed system, yet now we’re really quite anxious to make sure that we correct that.”
Gordon brought up the critical function of separation of powers in government and noted that Wyoming lawmakers are seeking ways to pull power into the legislative branch.

“That’s the definition of tyranny” as set out by James Madison in the Federalist Papers, Gordon said. It’s important to keep an eye on the division of powers, he said, adding later, “I am concerned that the Legislature is trying to take to itself the powers that aren’t accorded to it in the Constitution of how to run elections.” 
In all his years in Wyoming politics, Gordon continued, he has never seen such high levels of distrust. 
While moderators asked specifically about critical comments Gordon has exchanged with Gray in public forums, the governor declined to go into detail about the feud.
Gordon did acknowledge that with increasingly ugly campaigns, he can see why people would not be encouraged to run for office. 
“It’s hard for me to try to convince somebody to put yourself through that,” he said, even when there’s “a terrific reward on the other side.
“On the other hand, if we don’t get engaged, we surrender the field, and that is not a good option, in my mind.” 
Tax confusion 
Next, Barton asked: “Is there any policy that you believe has been passed by the Legislature that has not been fully understood by the voting public, such as consequences of reducing property taxes in the downstream impacts to our small towns and counties?” 
She was referring to a law passed in March amid concern about rising property taxes that authorized a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a single-family home’s fair market value. The law resulted in shrinking property tax revenues for towns, counties and hundreds of special districts across Wyoming — which fund everything from hospitals to 4-H and county road and bridge departments.

“I think that particular issue is one that Wyoming communities are beginning to wrestle with,” Gordon said. “You’re hearing out of Casper that parks aren’t as neat as they used to be. You’re hearing out of Basin, we’re having to close libraries. And these consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
What’s especially unfortunate about it, Gordon said, is that many people misunderstood how property taxes are levied and allocated. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state,” he said, “and it goes to local governments. It’s how fire departments are funded, it’s how parks are funded, it’s how roads are funded, senior centers, all of that stuff is funded from local taxes.”
Gordon remembers a legislator on the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee saying, “the state doesn’t need that property tax.” 
“A member of the Joint Appropriations Committee did not understand, the state doesn’t collect that property tax,” he continued. “And so by that misrepresentation, I think we are not doing what is the right thing for Wyoming.”

(Screenshot taken of Loras College inauguration ceremony)By the time Michael Doyle picked up the phone for an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch Friday morning he’d already been up for hours, waking at 4 a.m. to work out and get ready for his inauguration day.
The now-official Loras College president even made it to the Dubuque campus before the sun had fully risen, to drop off a binder containing his speech and the speech his wife would give in his introduction.
“So pretty much a normal day,” Doyle said.
However, the rest of his day did not follow the usual path. More than a year after being named president-elect of Loras College, Doyle was inaugurated as the university’s 27th president officially Friday with a Mass, reception and activities for students and visitors. During his speech, Doyle said he welcomes Loras College’s new chapter with the knowledge of its strong foundation and forward movement.
Doyle was selected by the Loras College Board of Regents as president-elect in July 2024 and worked alongside then-President Jim Collins until Collins retired in the spring. He previously worked at Loras for 14 years in different roles, including vice president for institutional advancement and chief financial officer, and returned to the college after more than two years of working as president of Steele Capital Management, Inc.

It was “the pull of the students” and the higher education environment that had Doyle missing Loras, his alma mater. He said he’s excited to be back even as higher education faces challenges with enrollment and finances. Loras has to be “nimble” as it and other colleges navigate changing federal programs, the enrollment cliff, rising costs and more.
“We pay attention to what’s going on, and we have to adapt and adjust based on … federal and state legislation,” Doyle said. “But we’re not going to make excuses, and we’re just going to move forward and do what we need to do to have success.”
Part of moving forward has been implementing strategies developed during his time as president-elect, Doyle said, aimed at increasing enrollment, fundraising and lowering institutional debt.
In the fall of 2024, Loras “implemented a fundamentally sound strategic enrollment plan” that resulted in an “11% increase in first year transfer and graduate enrollment” — a metric Doyle said he hopes will continue to grow over the next five years.
Loras also ended its fiscal year in May with the highest annual cash fundraising total in the college’s history and more than double what was raised the previous fiscal year, at more than $15.6 million. Momentum is also growing for the college’s current $20 million fundraising campaign, to which donors have already committed more than $13.7 million.
Payoffs are coming in from efforts to decrease the university’s long-term debt as well, Doyle said, with a plan launched last September culminating in one-quarter of debt already eliminated. Loras reached this point more than two years ahead of schedule.
Five years down the line, Doyle said he sees a thriving Loras College that has met and exceeded the goals set before he fully stepped into the role as president. Even as two Catholic universities, St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University, move forward in a strategic combination, Doyle said “Catholic higher education is strong” and Loras being rooted in faith and its legacy will help keep that strength going.
“We’re facing strong headwinds, there are challenges, but we’re going to lean into those challenges and meet those challenges head on,” Doyle said. “And we feel we’re well positioned to move into the future and raise Loras to new heights.”

Gov. Phil Scott filled two leadership positions at the Vermont Department of Economic Development on Friday, positions that have been in flux since the departure of a longtime administrator this spring.
Lyle Jepson, head of the Chamber and Economic Development of the Rutland Region since 2020, will be the new department’s new commissioner. Nick Grimley, currently the department’s Director of Entrepreneurship and Tech Commercialization, will be deputy commissioner. 
Both will begin their new jobs on Nov. 4, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

The department operates within the Agency of Commerce and Community Development and oversees a number of programs related to promoting economic development and job growth in Vermont.
Jepson is stepping into a position filled by two interim commissioners since the departure of longtime department head Joan Goldstein in April. Her deputy, Brett Long, initially stepped in as interim commissioner. Upon Long’s retirement, the interim post was filled by Tim Tierney, who will now be returning to his previous role as director of business recruitment and international trade for the department, said Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, in an email.
Prior to his regional economic development role in Rutland, Jepson spent 30 years in public and technical education across the state, the announcement said. Grimley, with the department since 2017, had previously co-founded the business accelerator LaunchVT.
“Growing the economy has been one of my top priorities since being elected governor,” Scott said in the release. “I believe Lyle’s decades of experience as an educator, as well as Nick’s proven track record supporting the business community, will serve Vermonters well.”

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Statues of civil rights activist Rosa Parks and disability rights activist Helen Keller were unveiled at the Alabama State Capitol Friday, the first Alabama women to be depicted there. 
The dedication ended six years of work by the Alabama Women’s Tribute Statue Commission to get the statues installed. 
“Today we gather to lift two legacies, Rosa Parks and Helen Keller. Two women born in Alabama on the soil of this great state with the grit and grace that changed the trajectory of not just our state, but our nation,” Commissioner Tracey Morant Adams said at the ceremony Friday.

The commission consists of six members with Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, serving as chair. In 2019, Hall sponsored HB 287, which began the project. 
“For the very first time, the grounds of our Capitol will feature statues of women, and what finer examples could there be than Rosa Parks and Helen Keller?” Gov. Kay Ivey asked at the ceremony. “These are two Alabama daughters who were born in small towns who faced extraordinary challenges and yet rose to shape history through quiet strength and unwavering and unwavering conviction.”
The statue of Parks is placed at the front of the Alabama State Capitol near the steps, and near a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, and J. Marion Sims, an obstetrician who experimented on enslaved women.

The statue of Keller is seen behind the building facing the current Alabama State House. That building is set to be demolished and replaced with green space after the completion of the new Alabama Statehouse,  expected to be completed in the fall of 2026.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, also spoke at the ceremony. In 2018, Figures sponsored SB 365 which made Dec. 1, the day Parks was arrested for not giving up her seat in the whites only section of a segregated bus to a white man, a state holiday.
“This is such a historical day for Alabama. For us to unveil the first two women’s statues, but those two women are an African American and a caucasian Alabamian, and that just shows you how far we have come as a state,” Figures said.
The Helen Keller statue sits on a limestone bench and depicts Keller reading a book in Braille with her left hand extended as if she is doing tactile lip reading. The plaque on the statue tells Keller’s life story in English and Braille and features the American Sign Language finger spelling alphabet and the Braille alphabet.
“This translation, this opportunity for students to learn is something that must be noted and it is so exciting for all of us to think about the potential of what is to come because of this effort,” Commissioner Annie Butrus said Friday at the unveiling.
The Rosa Parks statue at the front of the State Capitol shows Parks in motion walking up the steps of what would be the bus she was taking nearly 70 years ago on Dec. 1, about a mile from the Capitol down Montgomery’s Dexter Avenue.
“I want you to be reminded of her resolve and commitment to step up, take action, powerfully communicating the thinking behind that action,” Julia Knight, the creator of the statue, said at the unveiling. “Rosa Parks was not a tired seamstress, she was a dedicated activist.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7717-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 17:18:06.695696

""I was kind of surprised that Vermont would recognize New Hampshire certifications, but New Hampshire wouldn’t recognize Vermont,” said New Hampshire Rep. Thomas Oppel.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 23, 2025.
WEST CANAAN — A Mascoma-area state legislator has proposed a bill that would make it easier for Vermont-licensed school bus drivers to become certified in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire state Rep. Thomas Oppel, D-Grafton, decided to introduce the bill after learning about the challenge of finding bus drivers to serve the Mascoma Valley Regional School District. As the school year began in August, Mascoma was forced to make some last minute changes to its bus routes because of the shortage of drivers.
One difficulty is the licensing requirements in Vermont and New Hampshire, Steve Landon, location manager at Butler’s Bus Service branch in White River Junction, said in September. People licensed to drive in New Hampshire can easily drive in Vermont because the Green Mountain State recognizes New Hampshire licenses, but in New Hampshire, drivers with Vermont licenses must go through the Granite State’s process as if they are a new bus driver.
“I hadn’t thought about it and I was kind of surprised that Vermont would recognize New Hampshire certifications, but New Hampshire wouldn’t recognize Vermont,” said Oppel, whose district includes Canaan, Dorchester and Orange.
He spoke to New Hampshire Department of Transportation officials and asked Legislative Services in Concord, which assists lawmakers with research, to put together a side-by-side comparison of Vermont and New Hampshire requirements. They are similar in that both states require that bus drivers have a commercial driver’s license and an added bus driver certification.
“If you’re certified in New Hampshire or Vermont, you can drive in either state if my bill passes,” said Oppel, who has found co-sponsors for his bill, including NH Rep. David Fracht, D-Enfield, and NH Rep. Henry Giasson, R-Goffstown.
Before signing onto the bill, Giasson, a member of the House Transportation Committee, wanted to confirm that the two states’ requirements were similar, he said. Giasson was satisfied with the research Oppel did. “If a New Hampshire bus company can employ a Vermont bus driver with no safety risk to the public, I don’t see why we wouldn’t allow it at this point,” Giasson said.
Even though Goffstown is more than an hour from the Vermont border and the bill would not necessarily affect Giasson’s constituents, he said, “I think it’s a good call to expand our market to people in border states.”
While the bill won’t necessarily alleviate the challenge of finding more bus drivers for rural routes like those in Mascoma — which includes Canaan, Enfield, Dorchester, Grafton and Orange — it could make it easier for Butler’s Bus Service to move drivers around as needed to serve other school districts, especially those that are located along the Connecticut River.
“It may not help with recruiting drivers necessarily, but it certainly would help us be able to spread the drivers that we do have around to different customers for sure,” Landon said.
Currently, if a bus driver certified in Vermont wants a New Hampshire certification, they have to go through a background check and — once that’s cleared — they have to do 10 hours of training in New Hampshire by a state-certified instructor, then take a written test to get school bus certificate, said Landon.
Getting the original Vermont certification takes eight hours and also requires a background check and written test. It can take between 30 and 60 days for a certified Vermont bus driver to go through the New Hampshire certification process.
“It would help us because the locations that we have that are on the border of Vermont and New Hampshire, I could possibly share drivers quicker than I can now,” Landon said. For example, a driver based in White River Junction could then drive a route in Plainfield or Cornish, which Butler’s also serves, without having to redo their training in New Hampshire.
Mascoma Valley Regional School District Superintendent Amanda Isabelle called Oppel’s proposed legislation “exciting.” Mascoma is still in need of one more bus driver and while there are currently people in training to fill that spot, the legislation would allow Vermont bus drivers to fill in on a substitute basis. The dual state process “is absurd to me,” she said. “You’re already on a bus. You don’t need to come here to be trained to drive a bus.”
Mascoma now has three employees — the district’s special education director, a social worker and an administrative assistant in the special education department — going through the training process to be able to transport students in vans in case of an emergency.
Another Mascoma employee is in the process of obtaining a commercial driver’s license so that they can become a substitute bus driver. “We’ve had a lot of our employees step up and it’s much appreciated,” Isabelle said.
Oppel’s legislative service request for the bus driver bill has not been drafted into formal legislation and does not yet have a bill number.

(Photo courtesy Harry Reid International Airport)U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford on Friday sent a letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo urging him to do “everything within his power” to ensure Nevadans continue to receive food stamps during a prolonged federal government shutdown.
That should include the possibility of Lombardo calling a special legislative session, read the letter, which was also signed by Horsford’s fellow Democratic peers, U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Susie Lee.
“Whether through official actions or by simply picking up the phone and telling his fellow Republicans to end this cruelty, the Governor must act,” said Horsford in a press release announcing the sending of the letter.
In any given month, approximately 500,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the population — receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. Lombardo’s office has confirmed that, if the federal government shutdown extends beyond Oct. 31, federal funding would be insufficient to cover the cost of SNAP for November and beyond.
Independent of the government shutdown, Nevada SNAP is already expecting budget turmoil. Administrators of the program in August told state legislators that a new federal requirement that states pay them to use an income verification system will force the state to reallocate $19 million in the current fiscal biennium, and will cost the state $25 million annually in future biennia.
At the same time, local food banks have reported seeing increased demand.
Lombardo did not respond to the Nevada Current‘s request for comment by publication time.
His office earlier this week did say it is working with the state departments of human services and agriculture to “secure supplemental resources for SNAP beneficiaries in the event the shutdown extends beyond October 31.”
Horsford’s letter acknowledged and applauded those efforts but added the governor should “use every tool and resource available.”
Also on Friday, Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine publicly called on state elected officials to step in. He noted Nevada currently has the highest Rainy Day Fund balance in state history.

Bob Ferguson hands over one of the pens he used to sign House Bill 1296, the 'students bill of rights' to a child who attended the bill signing. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)School board directors and parents sued Washington state Thursday to block a Democrat-backed law overhauling rights for public school students and their parents.
The policy has become a flashpoint in the national debate over gender inclusivity and diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools. A conservative political group has a separate push underway to get it overturned through the legislative process or at the ballot box. 
This week’s lawsuit, filed in Thurston County Superior Court, argues House Bill 1296 violates state and U.S. constitutional rights guaranteeing the free exercise of religion and ensuring parents can raise their children without state interference.
The debate over House Bill 1296 was one of the most contentious of this year’s legislative session in Olympia. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the law in May.
Republicans argued that it undermines Initiative 2081, which lawmakers passed last year. 
The earlier initiative enshrined certain rights for parents of public school children, specifically around issues like reviewing classroom materials, obtaining medical records, and opting children out of assignments involving questions about their sexual experiences or their family’s religious beliefs.   
Let’s Go Washington, the group that spearheaded Initiative 2081, is collecting signatures to get a measure before lawmakers next year that would repeal this year’s rewrite. If the group is successful, and lawmakers don’t approve it, this new measure could end up before voters in 2026. 
Republicans and other critics of this year’s law argued that it undermined last year’s initiative.  
Democrats countered that changes were necessary to protect vulnerable children. 
One of the most significant changes removed parental access to their children’s school-based medical records. The complaint claims these revisions violate the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, known as FERPA.
Other changes include pushing back the deadline for parents to receive copies of their child’s school records from 10 days to 45 days. 
One of the plaintiffs, Gabriel Galbraith, is a Kennewick school board member. In March, the board pleaded with the Trump administration to force the state to comply with the president’s executive order seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.
“We’re being told not to share information that parents have a right to know,” Galbraith, who is up for re-election next month, said in a statement Thursday. “That’s not education — that’s state interference in the family.”
The more than half-a-dozen other plaintiffs include school board members from Lynden, Darrington, Woodland and Deer Park, and parents from Olympia and Tumwater. 
One parent reported taking her son out of Olympia public schools because she couldn’t opt him out of instruction about gender identity.
The state Legislature, Ferguson, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and state Superintendent Chris Reykdal are named as defendants in the lawsuit.

A spokesperson for Reykdal said the agency is reviewing the complaint. 
“OSPI is charged with implementing, upholding, and enforcing the law and will continue to do so unless or until the law changes,” spokesperson Katy Payne said in an email. 
The parents and school board members are represented by the conservative Citizen Action Defense Fund and Joel Ard, a Washington lawyer who has challenged Democratic-backed policies and represented the state Republican Party.
The lawsuit also argues the law violates the state constitution’s “single subject” rule as the legislation deals with both parental and student rights.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)As many as 1.4 million Georgians who rely on federal food assistance could face the abrupt loss of benefits starting Nov. 1 if the government shutdown has not ended.
The Georgia Department of Human Services announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed the state that there is “insufficient funding” to cover November payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is 100% federally funded and provides food assistance to about one in 10 Georgia residents.
If the shutdown is not resolved soon, SNAP electronic benefit transfer cards will not work beginning Nov. 1, according to DHS. Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time required to process the payments and make them available to recipients would likely delay benefits. The state agency advised recipients to use existing funds on their cards now and plan ahead. 
The federal government shutdown began on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year. U.S. House Republicans passed a stopgap spending bill that would have funded the government until November, but that is stuck in the Senate, where Democrats say they won’t vote for a continuing resolution until Republicans agree to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. 
The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute urged the USDA to take immediate steps to release available contingency funds to cover at least partial payments for the program, which serves more than 640,000 children in the state.
“If the administration can cover full or even partial SNAP benefits for November, it provides some certainty that families and individuals can go to the grocery store and buy the essentials and maybe something for Thanksgiving,” Ife Finch Floyd, the institute’s director of economic justice, said Thursday.
But the USDA on Friday announced that it would not use contingency funds to provide food assistance benefits, stating that the government shutdown occurred before SNAP funding for the new fiscal year was enacted.
The USDA has about $6 billion in contingency funds, enough to cover about two-thirds of one month’s national SNAP benefits. GBPI also suggested that the USDA use its discretionary authority, as it did in early October for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, to secure additional resources to fully fund November benefits.
SNAP provides more than $3 billion annually to Georgia’s local economies and is critical for retailers statewide, according to GBPI. Usage is higher in rural areas, where about 17% of the population relies on the assistance, compared to 11% in metropolitan areas.

Sept. 9, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceEnvironmental advocates, community leaders and members of the Michigan Legislature will gather on Detroit’s east side Sunday for food and festivities while demanding accountability from the state’s largest energy providers. 
The East Side Community Network’s Stoudamire Wellness Hub will host state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), state Reps. Tonya Myers Phillips  (D-Detroit) and Donovan McKinney (D-Detroit), and Detroit Action Political Director James Johnson alongside Detroit residents and representatives from multiple organizing groups, as they call out the state’s largest energy providers over high rates and poor reliability.
The speakers will also offer information about the ratepayer bill of rights, a slate of bills which aims to address these issues alongside concerns that political spending is stymying additional regulations on energy providers. 
The “Our Bills Are Too Damn High!” block party runs Sunday from  2 p.m. to 4 p.m. with speeches set to begin at 3 p.m. In addition to remarks from lawmakers and residents calling for greater accountability from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s largest energy companies, the event will feature food and performances.
In recent years, both utilities have faced repeated criticism for high energy prices and poor reliability, with the Citizens Utility Board, an energy utility watchdog, noting that the companies have “some of the highest outage durations among all investor-owned utilities in the nation.”
Ballot initiative seeks to ban political contributions from monopoly corporations, like utilities

While both companies have each pledged to improve their services, customers and advocacy groups have remained frustrated with the utilities’ near yearly requests to increase their rates, with DTE requesting a $574 million rate increase earlier this year, while Consumers Energy requested a $436 million increase for its electrical rates. 
Dana St. Couer, a senior communication strategist for DTE said customers saw 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 due to $1.5 billion in investments in the electric grid last year coupled with less extreme weather. 
In a statement on Jan. 14, Consumers Energy said the average customer spent 21 fewer minutes without power in 2024, with 93% of customers seeing their power restored within 24 hours. 
Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, emphasized in an email to the Michigan Advance that the company’s rate requests fund future investments. 
“For example, clearing trees away from power lines is critical to our plan, addressing the #1 cause of outages. We are proposing a five-year timetable to clear all of our system’s low-voltage lines, which serve homes and businesses directly,” Carey said. “We had previously been working toward a seven-year effective cycle. We plan to clear 8,000 miles of high- and low-voltage power lines this year. We expect a 30% reduction in tree-related outage incidents by 2030.”
In the interim, lawmakers have offered their own solutions through legislation seeking greater accountability from energy providers, while providing customers additional protections. 
The ratepayer bill of rights includes legislation sponsored by McKinney that would increase the outage credit customers receive on their bills to $5 an hour, gradually increasing to $15 an hour after 24 hours without service and $25 dollars per hour in interruptions longer than 72 hours. 
The current credit offers customers $42 if their outages last 16 hours or longer under normal conditions, 48 hours if skies are gray and 96 hours under catastrophic weather conditions, with customers receiving an additional $42 for each day they are without power. 
The package also includes Myers Phillips’ House Bill 5047, which would ensure winter shut off protections for households with seniors 65 and older, and children 16 and younger. 
The ratepayers bill of rights also includes legislation to allow for the establishment of community solar energy programs, and to ban utility companies and businesses seeking government contracts from making political contributions. 
Chang told the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the event is aimed at raising awareness and getting more community members engaged on issues of energy affordability and reliability, while providing those affected with concrete solutions they can take action on. 
Oftentimes when there is a major storm, Chang said her office will hear from residents and see the resulting power outages firsthand. While the outage credit has increased in recent years, it does not match the impact felt by those facing the outage Chang said, pointing to individuals losing the food in their refrigerator as one example. 
When looking at the ratepayer’s bill of rights as a package, Chang emphasized that these policies focus on what ratepayers need. 
“When we talk about reliability, when we talk about energy policy, when we talk about outages, ultimately, it’s about people,” Chang said, noting that these outages weigh the heaviest on those who are already struggling to pay their bills and keep food on the table.”

Former state Rep. Robin Smith, R-Hixson, was sentenced Friday to eight months in federal prison for her role in a corruption conspiracy described as a scheme to steal from Tennessee and its citizens through the General Assembly’s taxpayer-funded constituent mail program.
Smith, 62, “failed the trust of the public” and has “been a failure,” she said during her sentencing hearing in Nashville federal court.
“My mom and dad raised me to be much better than this,” Smith said. “I ask for the forgiveness of the public.”
Smith pleaded guilty in March 2022 to one count of honest services wire fraud, a charge regularly used in corruption prosecutions, and agreed to “full, complete and truthful” cooperation with the federal government.
She was fined $7,500 and will be on supervised release for one year after incarceration. Smith cried while addressing the court Friday morning, frequently referencing her Christianity and the debt she said she owes to her family, friends, God and the public.
“There isn’t a day that goes by where that reality doesn’t confront me in a real way,” she said.
Smith, ex-Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, and his one-time chief of staff, Cade Cothren, all played a part in a scheme to illegally profit off the General Assembly’s taxpayer-funded constituent mail program from October 2019 to early January 2021.
As part of Smith’s plea deal, she testified against Casada and Cothren during their May federal trial. It was the right thing to do, and she was simultaneously hoping for leniency in her sentence, she said at the time.
A Nashville jury ultimately found Casada guilty of 17 counts and Cothren guilty of all 19 counts of bribery, conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and theft, according to federal court records.
Both men were sentenced in September.
Casada is expected to serve 36 months in federal prison, one year of probation and pay a $30,000 fine, court records show. Cothren was sentenced to 30 months in prison, one year of probation and a $25,000 fine.
Casada, Cothren and Smith allegedly all helped to create a fake company called Phoenix Solutions, which designed and sent mailers to constituents on behalf of politicians through the use of taxpayer funds.
The group intended to do the work they were hired to do, Smith testified, but they also intended to profit.
The group received nearly $52,000 from the state in payments related to the postage and printing allowance over the course of 2020, according to a trial brief, which stated that Cothren paid Casada and Smith more than $35,000 in bribes and kickbacks during that time.
The scheme allegedly went on into early January 2021.
FBI agents raided Smith’s home that same month.
District Judge Eli J. Richardson said at sentencing that Smith was more involved than Casada in really propping up Phoenix Solutions, pressuring public officials and “spinning a web of fabrications.”
“We have these public officials,” he said. “We elect them to do the right thing.”
Former Tennessee rep says identities had to be “masked” in kickback scheme

And then, in this case, they turn around, lie and deceive, according to Richardson.
“It’s pretty callous stuff, and it’s not a great look,” he said.
Smith led the Hamilton County Republican Party from 1998 until 2002 and was unanimously elected to lead the state GOP in 2007.
She was elected in 2018 to represent state House District 26, which includes parts of central Chattanooga and extends north along Chickamauga Lake, encompassing, among other communities, Hixson, Lakesite, Middle Valley and Sale Creek.
Smith resigned from her seat in March 2022 amid her plea deal.
Her life has been defined by doing good things for others besides this one “stain on her life,” her attorney William David Bridgers said.
She’s dedicated time to nonprofits and the public, has a strong presence within her religious community and cares for her sick mother, he said.
Their crimes began after Cothren resigned in 2019. He allegedly sent sexually explicit and racist text messages and admitted to using cocaine in a legislative office on one occasion, according to reporting by the Associated Press. Casada, who allegedly received some of those messages and sent his own lewd remarks, resigned shortly after.
Smith was part of this scheme to help both men rehabilitate their lives after their “really bad scandal” rather than to scam legislators, Bridgers said.
She knew her actions were morally wrong but didn’t know she committed a crime until the FBI came knocking at her door, he said. She quickly began cooperating with the federal government once she realized the gravity of her actions.
“She had sinned against her God,” Bridgers said. “She had sinned against her family. She had sinned against her government.”
Richardson, apparently in response to Bridger’s arguments, said Smith wouldn’t have taken 25% of the profits if she only wanted to help Casada and Cothren.
“The one way I don’t help out other people is by taking a cut of what they have,” Richardson said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-004-scaled-e1761360698548-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-10-24 22:56:38.320342

In this image from Jan. 13, 2025, Schwab performs ceremonial duties at the Kansas Capitol. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab received praise from President Donald Trump for making Kansas one of the first states to commit to use of a federal database to confirm U.S. citizenship of people registered to vote.
Schwab, who is a Republican candidate for governor in 2026, had previously lauded the president for taking steps to help states screen voter registration lists through sharing of federal data. As secretary of state, Schwab is Kansas’ top election official.
In March, Trump signed an executive order making the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program available to states for free. SAVE exists as an online platform enabling local, state and federal governments to electronically check a federal database for immigration and citizenship status of applicants for public benefits.
“You were one of the first leaders to step up and protect the integrity of our elections by using the SAVE system,” Trump said in a letter sent to Schwab on Oct. 8 and shared publicly several days ago by Schwab. “As you know, safeguarding our elections is a dual responsibility of the states and federal government. This vital mission requires our partnership to be based on mutual trust and a shared commitment to our constitutional responsibilities.”
Trump said in correspondence to Schwab the “right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted, without illegal dilution, is a prerequisite for our government to truly be representative.”
The president said “many states” were failing to enforce basic and necessary election laws. The executive order, and wider reliance on SAVE, could be useful to states working to “reverse this dereliction,” Trump’s letter said.
Trump has claimed without evidence President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election due to voting misconduct.
In July, Schwab attended a White House meeting with other state elections officers to discuss sharing of federal data. He said at that time it could be beneficial if Kansas could have routine access to the Social Security Administration’s death index and data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to identify individuals who were deceased or noncitizens and ineligible to vote.
Schwab, who has repeatedly declared Kansas elections fair and accurate, said reliance on up-to-date databases could improve voter confidence in the state’s election system.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132223-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday it will install election monitors in Passaic County, acceding to a request from Republican Party officials there.
The announcement comes 11 days before Election Day, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has President Donald Trump’s endorsement, is vying against Democrat Mikie Sherrill to become our next governor.
“We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
The announcement follows a request for federal intervention from GOP officials who have sought greater scrutiny of mail voting in Passaic, a heavily Democratic county that flipped to support Trump in last year’s presidential race. Federal officials did not provide a justification for the deployment of monitors.
New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the federal deployment “highly inappropriate.”
“DOJ has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions,” he said in a statement. “The Constitution gives states, not the federal government, the primary responsibility for running elections, and our state’s hardworking elections officials have been preparing for months to run a safe and secure election. We are committed to ensuring that every eligible voter is able to cast their ballot and make their voices heard.”
Platkin’s office said he is weighing options to prevent voter intimidation and election interference as a result of the federal deployment.
A spokesperson for the Passaic County Board of Elections, whose membership is split equally between Republicans and Democrats, said it is aware of the feds’ plans and will cooperate.
“The Board is committed to ensuring that the election is administered fairly, securely, and smoothly and will cooperate with the USDOJ to achieve those objectives while ensuring that eligible voters are able to cast their vote,” said Lindsay Reed, a spokesperson for the board.
She added that the board would accede to the department’s request to observe the transfer and counting of mail ballots. Democrats vote by mail at far greater rates than Republicans.
Voting fraud allegations are not unheard of in Passaic County. In 2020, Paterson Councilmen Michael Jackson and Alex Mendez, who had not yet taken office, were charged with mail ballot fraud and related charges for allegedly acting as ballot bearers for more than three ballots — the maximum allowed under state law — and for failing to identify themselves as ballot bearers.
A Superior Court judge ordered the May election be rerun that November, and both men won the do-over race. Neither has been convicted, and both were reelected last year.
The judge’s order made no finding of voter fraud, leaving that to criminal courts, but ordered a new race because of various procedural violations related to mail voting.
The Department of Justice said it would also deploy election monitors to five California counties. Four of those counties are politically competitive, and one is overwhelmingly Democratic.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)Child tax credits are becoming more popular across the country, with more than a dozen states offering them as financial relief toward the cost of raising kids.
But new research suggests cities could significantly reduce child poverty by offering child tax credit programs of their own.
An analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University and the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that municipal programs could move the needle with relatively small amounts of money: offering $1,000 or less per year to low- and middle-income families could cut child poverty rates by 25% in several cities.  
Researchers say this sort of new assistance would not only boost household finances, but also likely create more demand for local businesses, stabilize housing markets and increase local tax revenue.
The study focused on 14 cities: Baltimore; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Jacksonville, Florida; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; New York; Oakland, California; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Seattle; and the District of Columbia. The analysis found that most of those cities could make significant gains by spending less than 15% of municipal revenues on new child credit programs. 
Red states pushed child tax credits this year, but the broadest plans fizzled

In Minneapolis, for example, researchers said a new program that cost less than $30 million per year would cut the city’s poverty levels by half when accounting for existing state and federal credits. (The mayor there has recommended spending about $2.03 billion in the 2026 fiscal year budget.) 
The prospect of creating new tax credit programs would likely pose financial and logistical challenges. Cities already are juggling many other priorities including public safety and housing affordability, while at the same time facing what some experts have characterized as a “fiscal crisis” from growing climate change costs, federal funding cuts and declining downtown activity.
Some cities, including Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia, have city income taxes that could incorporate a child tax credit. But, the research noted, cities without that tax managed to distribute pandemic recovery funds through basic income programs. That experience shows cities could create their own standalone applications, leverage IRS data-sharing agreements or  work with third-party administrators.
“So you could use a similar sort of outreach approach, which wouldn’t necessarily be as comprehensive or systematic as a city that already has its own income tax system in place, but it’s a potential option,” said Ryan Vinh, an author of the study and a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. 
State interest in creating or expanding child tax credits boomed after the pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit delivered cash directly to millions. That move quickly lifted millions of children out of poverty, researchers found. But the expanded tax credit expired in 2021 — leading to a doubling in the nation’s childhood poverty rate in 2022.
Advocates favor refundable tax credits that provide money directly to families. While parents must still file tax returns to receive the benefit, refundable credits give parents funds even if they earn too little to owe income tax, providing financial relief for groceries, medical care or rent. 
This year, several conservative-led states explored new child tax credit programs, though proposals offering the biggest benefits to families fizzled in Indiana and Ohio. So far, no city has implemented its own credit. 
While many cities and states are facing tight budget constraints, Vinh said a reduction in federal support will likely put more pressure on local governments to tackle challenges like poverty. The federal government has slashed funding for safety net programs including Medicaid and the nation’s largest food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
“A lot of these things will either lead to the erosion of benefits over time, a loss of benefits, or kind of a decline in what families are able to receive,” Vinh said. “We don’t fully know the number yet, but we do know that child poverty will most likely increase as these program restrictions increase.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti joined a filing Friday in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting President Donald Trump’s order to end automatic birthright citizenship.
The brief brought by Skrmetti and 24 other states’ attorneys general urges the court to clarify that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause doesn’t grant automatic citizenship to people born on American soil regardless of their parents’ residency and immigration status. 
The American Civil Liberties Union, multiple state attorneys general and immigration rights groups challenged the executive order. But Skrmetti sided with the president even though his order was blocked in early October by a federal appeals court in Boston.
“The idea that citizenship is guaranteed to everyone born in the United States doesn’t square with the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment or the way many government officials and legal analysts understood the law when it was adopted after the Civil War,” Skrmetti said in a statement.
The Fourteenth Amendment says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Yet the attorney general said the brief provides evidence from the 1860s through early 1900s backing his interpretation that citizenship required parental domicile and allegiance to the United States, not temporary or unlawful presence.
About 4.4 million U.S.-citizen children under 18 lived with at least one person without permanent legal documentation as of 2018, according to the American Immigration Council.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay said Friday that he wants to hear more about the legality behind Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s order to deploy hundreds from the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. 
Lindsay listened to more than an hour of legal arguments on Friday related to a lawsuit brought by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union and the West Virginia Citizen Action Group against the state due to the National Guard deployment. 
Following some testimony and arguments from attorneys on the case, Lindsay ruled that the hearing will continue on Nov. 3. By that date, he said, he wants to see more information from the state regarding how Morrisey’s decision to send troops to D.C. following a request from President Donald Trump is legal.
The hearing was held due to the ACLU and CAG requesting a temporary restraining order to halt the deployment of West Virginia troops in D.C.
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Lindsay said the question of legality is “the central issue” to the case.
“Because if what the governor has done in the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., if that is lawful, that cures — at least in this court’s mind — whether or not a [temporary restraining order] is necessary, whether or not an irreparable harm has been suffered and whether or not there’s standing,” Lindsay said.
The ACLU and CAG argue in their lawsuit that the deployment is unlawful and an abuse of state powers that allow the governor to activate National Guard troops for matters outside of the state under limited circumstances. Attorneys for the ACLU further argued Friday that the ongoing deployment is causing real and irreparable harm to people in West Virginia, specifically at CAG. 
CAG executive director Dani Parent testified Friday that members of CAG — both employees and other community partners — are being tasked with fighting against and learning more about the National Guard deployment. By undertaking that work, Parent said, other critical work done by the organization related to defending democracy, government transparency and more is going undone. 
“Here we have a member-driven organization that is dedicated to this purpose, that is having to spend their time and money differently than they would have to were it not for the actions of [the state, in deploying the National Guard],” said Aubrey Sparks, legal director for the ACLU, during arguments to Lindsay. “That is harm. That is harm in a legal sense as well as in a practical sense.”
The state, represented by Chris Etheredge, who is a lawyer with the Attorney General’s Office, countered that this harm isn’t clear and it isn’t real. CAG, Etheredge argued, spends less than 25% of its resources on work related to democracy and government transparency. Etheredge continued that the only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” due to the National Guard deployment are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Lindsay asked Etheredge to clarify.
“You’re not saying that the only possible plaintiff that could bring this type of action would be a National Guard member? You’re not saying that, are you?” Lindsay asked.
“I’m saying that the only theoretical harm [the ACLU and CAG] have even alleged that could possibly give them a right to relief would be harm by a National Guard member,” Etheredge responded.
Sparks, however, argued that the harm is very real — especially if it was caused by an illegal action from the governor. 
“Transparency and accountability isn’t something that just happens once, you get it, and then you’re done,” Sparks said. “It’s built. It’s a norm. And when that norm is eroded, it doesn’t erode in just one area. It erodes it in all areas.”
Sparks, speaking after Friday’s hearing, said the case raises questions about what it means when set and established norms are threatened by potentially unlawful actions. It shouldn’t be a problem, she said, to prove that something done by the government was done legally and within all appropriate parameters of set law.
“This represents a real deviation from the norm that we have come to expect living in a democracy — that the government follows the rules that the government is bound by,” Sparks said. “I think when we deviate from that norm, when we erode it, it hurts a number of other democratic processes and principles, and in some ways, it’s a canary in a coal mine that we should all be really concerned about.”
Sparks continued, saying she believed it was “objectively a good thing” that Lindsay continued the hearing in order to ensure the court reaches “the right ruling.”
“And we’re confident that the right ruling is finding that the governor’s acts, and the [state’s] acts more broadly, were unlawful,” Sparks said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 20:36:34+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge approves Hartford HealthCare’s purchase of 2 Prospect-owned CT hospitals,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/hartford-health-care-prospect-purchase-judge/,"A judge approved on Friday the purchase of Manchester Memorial and Rockville General hospitals, currently owned by Prospect Medical Holdings.","A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved on Friday Hartford HealthCare’s $86.1 million purchase of two Connecticut hospitals owned by Prospect Medical Holdings — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General.
Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the court. The company did not receive any other bids for the two Connecticut facilities. 
Deborah Weymouth, president and CEO of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, said in an emailed statement that the organization is pleased to have received court approval.
“This marks an important milestone and we look forward to closing the transaction as quickly as possible,” Weymouth wrote.
Tina Varona, a spokesperson with Hartford HealthCare, said the health system is “uniquely positioned to deliver on our promise to these communities.”
“We are actively working to provide resources to stabilize and grow the workforce, enhance quality and safety, and make strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities and community partnerships,” Varona wrote in an emailed statement.
The deal still needs to receive state approval, known as a “certificate of need,” the process health care entities must clear before engaging in major transactions, like mergers and acquisitions.
OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time spent evaluating a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
During the state legislature’s 2025 session, earlier this year, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the newly-established emergency certificate of need process, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.
OHS spokesperson Wendy Fuchs confirmed that Hartford HealthCare has yet to file for an emergency certificate of need.
Some of the proceeds from the $86.1 million sale will go towards paying the towns of Manchester and Vernon for outstanding real property taxes. Lawyers for Manchester and Vernon claim the towns are owed $4.2 million and $1.1 million in real property taxes, according to court documents.
A lawyer with Medical Properties Trust, Prospect’s landlord and the company that owns the hospital buildings, declined to confirm how much the towns were owed, but said that any real estate taxes would be paid.
“I’m not going to opine on the precise number because I don’t think we have a view on the number. I leave that to the debtor. But we don’t dispute that, whatever the real estate taxes that the debtor and the buyer agree to with the townships, those will be paid at closing,” the attorney said.
A spokesperson for MPT did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
The towns’ attorneys also claim Manchester and Vernon are owed an additional $692,288 and $330,316 in personal property taxes. 
But Prospect has other debts to pay off that take priority over the municipal personal property taxes, including a loan from MPT that has a current balance of roughly $248 million. Unlike the real estate taxes, the outstanding personal property tax dispute would likely remain unresolved when the transaction closes, the judge said.
In addition to Manchester Memorial and Rockville General, Prospect also owns another Connecticut facility: Waterbury Hospital.
The state plans to acquire Waterbury as part of a broader plan to expand its own struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The state is also in talks to acquire two independent hospitals, Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam and Bristol Hospital. 
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 24.
The deal will also consist of some level of forgiveness of the outstanding taxes Prospect owes the state, Connecticut officials confirmed. 
Earlier this week, The Connecticut Mirror reported that Prospect owes the state more than $127 million in unpaid hospital provider taxes going back more than three years, according to court documents.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Gov. Greg Gianforte promoted Montana products and the Treasure State’s partnerships with South Korea and Japan on a trade mission this week.
On the trip, Gianforte, a Republican, touted, wheat, beef, coal and technology — and opportunities for future growth in trade — to business leaders, such as Chairman Jin-Sik Yoon of the Korea International Trade Association, one of Korea’s top five private economic organizations representing more than 70,000 companies.
In 2024, Korea was Montana’s second largest trading partner, with $335 million in exports, according to a series of news release from the Governor’s Office about the trip.
“Montana is open for business, and we are eager to partner with Korea’s most innovative companies,” Gianforte said in a statement. “From agriculture to advanced technology, Montana offers the talent, resources, and business climate needed to grow and succeed in the global market.”
In Korea, Gianforte highlighted an existing partnership with a couple of companies, UP Chemical and Advanced Material Solutions, and their recent investment in a manufacturing facility in Stevensville, the news release said.
It said SemiLink Materials recently established a facility in the Bitterroot and serves as a worldwide supplier of specialty gases for the semiconductor industry.
Industrial machinery exports, largely for semiconductor applications, were Montana’s largest export to Korea in 2024, accounting for $103 million in sales, and wheat is the state’s most consistent export to both Japan and Korea, at $38 million last year, according to a news release.
In Japan, Gianforte promoted wheat, beef and technology, and he outlined opportunities for collaboration in photonics, quantum, semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and clean energy, according to a news release. He also invited the Japan External Trade Organization to lead a delegation to Montana.
Gianforte highlighted Montana’s “strong business climate” and interest in encouraging innovation and more trade, a news release said.
He touted Montana’s work in bioscience and growth in academic research including in photonics.
“Globally, the photonics industry is estimated to be worth $1.75 trillion and is an enabling technology that contributes more than $16 trillion to global GDP,” a news release said. “Montana has one of the highest per capita concentrations of companies in the United States specializing in optics, photonics, and quantum technology and a strong history of working with Japan and Korea with some business partnerships having been established for over 30 years.”
In a statement, he said Montana and Japan share a deep history rooted in “respect, innovation and opportunity.”
“We’re building on that foundation by expanding our collaboration in technology, energy, and agriculture to create more good-paying jobs and investment in Montana and Japanese communities.”
He also met with representatives in the beef industry to highlight Montana as one of the top ten beef-producing states in the U.S. and the more than $41 million in beef exports sent to Japan last year.
The governor touted Montana coal and energy as well. A news release said roughly half of the 26 million metric tons of coal mined in Montana each year are exported to Asian markets through Canada.
“Montana has long been a global leader in providing dependable energy,” Gianforte said. “We’re committed to ensuring a stable supply of coal and to growing the partnerships that power communities here in Japan and back home in Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GG-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236
,DC,2025-10-24 20:31:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Pay for Trump and Congress continues in shutdown, unless they ask it be held",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pay-trump-and-congress-continues-shutdown-unless-they-ask-it-be-held,,"WASHINGTON — Some members of Congress are asking for their salaries to be withheld during the government shutdown, while federal workers on Friday missed their first full paycheck since many operations closed on Oct. 1.With no movement toward a deal to end the shutdown, the House remained on a prolonged break from Capitol Hill, the Senate left for its usual long weekend and President Donald Trump prepared to depart for a trip to China, where he will likely focus much more on foreign policy and tariffs than the funding lapse. The president, lawmakers and federal judges all receive their regular paychecks during government shutdowns, unlike the 2 million civilian federal employees and thousands of staffers who work in the legislative branch. Members of Congress are paid $174,000 a year and leaders are paid more.Active duty military members would also normally miss their paychecks, but the Defense Department reprogrammed $8 billion earlier this month to avoid a missed payday for U.S. troops. It’s unclear if the Pentagon can do that again ahead of the Oct. 31 pay date or if there was enough money left to cover those salaries. Pay for CongressUnlike most federal workers, members of Congress have the option to receive their pay as normal, donate their salaries to charity, give the money back to the Treasury, or have their checks withheld during this shutdown.  Rhode Island Democratic Rep. Gabe Amo posted a letter Thursday evening from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine L. Szpindor confirming that House members’ salaries can be held back until after the funding lapse ends. Szpindor wrote that legal requirements, including the 27th Amendment, entitle members of Congress to their pay and that any lawmaker who has their check withheld during a shutdown can request it be distributed at any time. Szpindor did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted said the Senate Financial Clerk told their office that while senators are required to be paid, officials can withhold his check until after the shutdown ends, at his request. The Senate disbursing office will continue to cut the check, but Husted will not pick it up until after Congress funds the government, the spokesperson said. Husted doesn’t believe members of Congress should receive their salaries on time when other federal workers cannot, the spokesperson said. A different Senate staffer, speaking on background about the issue, told States Newsroom the salary for another senator was transitioned from direct deposit to a physical paycheck so it could be held by the disbursing office for the duration of the shutdown, at that senator's request. Members of Congress who have asked for their salaries to be withheld include Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim, Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oregon Democratic Rep. Janelle Bynum, among others.  Spokespeople for Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., did not respond to a request for comment about whether they are having their salaries withheld during the shutdown. A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he is having his paycheck held back.Can lawmakers’ salaries legally be withheld?Congress has voted several times over the years to officially withhold members’ salaries during a shutdown, but none of the bills have ever become law. There have been questions during past funding lapses about whether members’ paychecks could legally be withheld.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst just before the shutdown began that member pay “is required by the Constitution and is considered mandatory spending.” “Thus, Members of Congress would continue to be paid during a lapse in discretionary appropriations,” CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote. That assessment lines up with a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, updated in August, that says “Members of Congress continue to receive their pay during a lapse in appropriations for a number of reasons.”Lawmaker salaries “have been provided by a permanent, mandatory, appropriation since” 1981, the report says.The U.S. Constitution, in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1, says: “Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”And the 27th Amendment to the Constitution says: “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.”The CRS report quotes the Government Accountability Office’s principles of federal appropriations law as saying, “The salary of a Member of Congress is fixed by statute and therefore cannot be waived without specific statutory authority.”But the report also points out nothing prevents a member of Congress from accepting the salary and then donating all or part of it back to the Treasury.No options and no paychecks for fedsThat same choice isn’t available for the people who work for members of Congress or those at departments and agencies throughout the executive branch. They must go without their paychecks until after Congress and the president broker a deal to fund the government and end the shutdown. Any worker who manages national security issues, or the protection of life or property, is considered exempt and continues working until the shutdown ends. Any federal employee not in that category is placed on furlough. The Senate was unable to advance multiple bills Thursday that would have provided salaries to some federal employees and contractors during the shutdown. Absent new congressional action, both exempt and non-exempt federal workers are supposed to receive back pay under a 2019 law once government reopens, though Trump and administration officials have cast doubt on whether they will do that for employees in the executive branch. Guidance from the House Committee on Administration says that all employees who work within the legislative branch will receive back pay once a funding bill becomes law. “Neither essential nor furloughed employees are authorized to receive compensation during a lapse in government funding,” the report says. “Federal law statutorily requires retroactive pay for furloughed and essential employees following the end of a lapse in government funding.”",,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Patrick Morrisey seeking to stop the sale of the state-run facility. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
The lawsuit comes as Morrisey’s sale of four long-term care hospitals, including the John Manchin center, is expected to close next week. 
Garcia, D-Marion, filed the complaint Thursday in Marion County Circuit on behalf of Mary DeVito, a 94-year-old widow who has lived at the facility since 2019 and requires 24-hour care, according to the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit names as defendants Morrisey and Michael Caruso, secretary of the state Department of Health Facilities, in their official capacities. 
Morrisey announced in August the state had reached a deal to sell four state-run long-term care facilities to New York-based development group Marx Development Group for $60 million. Besides the John Manchin facility, they include Hopemont Hospital in Preston County, Lakin Hospital in Mason County and Jackie Withrow Hospital in Raleigh County. 
Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. The facilities typically serve elderly patients using Medicaid. 
In the complaint, Garcia argues that Morrisey and Caruso don’t have the authority to divest Caruso of his duty to manage and operate the John Manchin facility. 
According to the lawsuit, House Bill 2006, legislation from 2023 that reorganized the state Department of Health and Human Resources into three departments, required the new Department of Health Facilities to operate the facility. Garcia believes the Legislature’s permission is required to sell the facilities. 
The case is assigned to Marion County Circuit Judge Matthew S. Delligatti.
Delligatti on Friday granted a temporary restraining order stopping the sale of the John Manchin facility. He scheduled a hearing in the case for 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Marion County Circuit Court. 
The sale is scheduled to close Oct. 31. 
In an email Friday, Drew Galang, Morrisey’s press secretary, said his administration has received the complaint and is aware of the temporary restraining order.  
“The contract to sell these facilities is based on very strong legal authority, and we look forward to communicating our arguments to the court at Tuesday’s hearing,” Galang wrote.

(Photo by Amelia Ferrell Knisely/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia residents can now add their driver’s license and state IDs to their Apple Wallet to be used at some Transportation Security Administration checkpoints at airports in the state and nationwide.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the news Thursday at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia.
This is a technological leap forward for our state as West Virginia becomes the 12th state in the country to adopt this technology,” Morrisey said. “This is a first step toward a broader rollout aimed at making everyday life easier for West Virginians.”
The rollout, done in collaboration with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles, is ongoing, and Morrisey said they hope to expand the use of the digital ID to include businesses and more. 
Right now, West Virginia residents can present their ID using their iPhone and Apple Watch at 250 TSA checkpoints at airports across the U.S., including West Virginia International Yeager Airport in Charleston and Huntington Tri-State Airport. 
“It’s only going to grow,” Morrisey said, adding that some of the smaller airports in the state are still waiting for scanners that can recognize digital ID. 
A news release from the governor’s office said that, “ID in Apple Wallet uses the privacy and security features that are built into Apple devices to help protect a user’s identity and personal information.” Users do not need to unlock or hand over their device to present their ID.
To add a West Virginia driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet, tap the + button at the top of the screen in Apple Wallet, select “Driver’s license or State ID” and follow the on-screen instructions to start the set-up and verification process.

(Screenshot via Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Montana)On the same day Montana’s insurance commissioner announced an investigation into a massive data breach by the state’s largest health insurance company, a group of attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit in Helena alleging that the corporation failed to notify customers and didn’t take standard precautions to safeguard the data, which could include birth dates, Social Security numbers and data on the health conditions of individuals.
The class action lawsuit, filed in Lewis and Clark County District Court, says that Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Montana should be held responsible for as many as 462,000 Montana customers’ private and healthcare information being taken. That is approximately one-third of the state’s residents.
Moreover, it accuses the insurance giant of knowing about the data breach for months, but failing to notify any of its customers that their information was at risk.
Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield said that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
However, in a story about Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance James Brown opening an investigation, a spokeswoman for the company told the Daily Montanan that a third-party vendor was responsible for the data breach, but it would not confirm the breadth of the leak.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Montana residents.
“This type of personal and sensitive data is highly targeted and sought after by hackers who seek to exploit that data for nefarious purposes,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit asks Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Christoper Abbott to certify it as class action, meaning that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield’s customer base of more than 460,000 could be named and eligible for any settlement. Attorneys for the group include Raph Graybill and Rachel Parker of Graybill Law Firm in Great Falls; John Heenan of Heenan and Cook in Billings; and David Paoli of the Paoli Law Firm in Missoula.
On Friday, a notice about the data breach was placed on the company’s website. It said that the breach was caused by third-party vendor, Conduent, and that notices about the breach were being sent to customers, beginning on Oct. 24.
The lawsuit also alleges that even though the data breach was discovered and known about in January 2025, Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield didn’t act quickly. Brown’s office confirmed with the Daily Montanan that it didn’t learn of the data breach till Oct. 8, nearly a year after it said the breach started. According to court documents, it lasted from October 2024 until January.
Montana law requires reporting of breaches “without reasonable delay.”
The lawsuit alleges that the data breach has resulted in several harmful results including an invasion of privacy, lost time and costs associated with the breach, and spam and fraud calls as well as identity theft.
The lawsuit also seeks several dozen remedies in seven counts being brought against Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield. Those counts include negligence, breach of contract, violating the Montana Consumer Protection Act and breach of fiduciary duty.
Attorneys argue that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield did not take adequate precautions in protecting the sensitive personal and health information, which should have included encrypting the information as well as deleting it when it was no longer needed.
The lawsuit also outlines how data obtained by hackers can be used and sold on the dark web.
“Private information can be sold at a price ranging from $40 to $200. Criminals can also purchase access to entire company data breaches from $900 to $4,500,” the suit said.
The lawsuit then explains how a few personally identifying data points can be parlayed into a larger and nearly complete identity theft of a person.
“Because a person’s identity is akin to a puzzle with multiple data points, the more accurate pieces of data an identity thief obtains about a person, the easier it is for the thief to take on the victim’s identity — or track the victim to attempt other hacking crimes against the individual to obtain more data to perfect a crime,”  the lawsuit said.  “With (complete) packages, cybercriminals can cross-reference two sources of private information to marry unregulated data available elsewhere to criminally stolen data with an astonishingly complete scope and degree of accuracy in order to assemble complete dossiers on individuals.”
The lawsuit also warns that cybercriminals often hold the data for some time before they use it, or victims don’t discover the theft until well after the fact, after financial damage is done.
“A study by Experian found that the average cost of medical identity theft is ‘about $20,000’ per incident and that most of victims of medical identity theft were forced to pay out-of-pocket costs for health care they did not receive to restore coverage. Almost half of medical identity theft victims lose their health care coverage as a result of the incident, while nearly one-third of medical identity theft victims saw their insurance premiums rise, and 40% were never able to resolve their identity theft at all.”
The lawsuit also pointed out that a 2007 General Accounting Office report said that fraudulently obtained data may be held for as long as a year before cybercriminals use it.
“As a result, studies that attempt to measure the harm resulting from data breaches cannot necessarily rule out all future harm,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit estimates that identity and credit theft monitoring will cost around $200 per year per class member.
“This is a future cost for a minimum of five years that plaintiffs and class members would not need to bear but for defendant’s failure to safeguard their private information,” the lawsuit said. “Through its failure to provide timely and clear notification of the data breach…(Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield) prevented plaintiffs and class members from taking meaningful, proactive steps to secure their private information and mitigate the impact of the data breach. (They) could have taken action earlier had they been timely notified of the data breach.”
As part of the lawsuit, attorneys for the plaintiffs are asking the court to impose a host of protections and punishments, including more encryption, destruction and purging of personally identifying information after its use, prohibiting keeping information on cloud-based services, ordering periodic security checks by both staff and independent auditors, as well as more comprehensive education and alert programs to inform staff and customers.
The suit also asks for actual damages, compensatory damages and punitive damages, as well as a 10-year third-party monitoring firm to report on whether Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield is complying with the court order.

The event was attended by political and higher education figures from across the state. (Photo courtesy of FIU)Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez took her oath of office Friday, cementing her (semi-)new title: president of Florida International University. 
The FIU community and Nuñez’s network gathered for her presidential investiture ceremony in Miami, complete with video comments from Gov. Ron DeSantis. She’d served at FIU on an interim basis since she left the governor’s office in February, 
“To lead FIU as its seventh president, and as the first alumna, is both the greatest honor and the greatest responsibility of my career,” Nuñez said during the ceremony at the Ocean Bank Convocation Center. Having earned a bachelor’s degree in 1994 and master’s in 1998 from FIU, she’s not only the first graduate to preside over the institution, but also the first woman to serve. 
“President Nuñez is a visionary leader, a dedicated public servant and a trailblazer whose lifelong commitment to excellence and innovation perfectly aligns with the bold future the Board of Trustees has laid out for her,” FIU Board of Trustees Chair Carlos Duart said. 
Nuñez’s network
Present at the ceremony were Attorney General James Uthmeier, Education Commissioner Anastasio Kamoutsas, Supreme Court Justice John Curiel, U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Naples), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Miami), Carlos Jiménez (R-Miami), and Frederica Wilson (D-Miami Gardens), and director of the U.S. Marshal Service Gadyaces Serralta.
A number of State University System figures attended, including Chancellor Ray Rodrigues.
Rodrigues, who served in the Legislature alongside Nuñez, pointed to her stint as chair of the Higher Education & Workforce Subcommittee in the House from 2012-2014, pointing to that committee’s efforts to establish preeminence classifications and performance-based funding.
“These two pieces of legislation, preeminence and performance-based funding, are what has driven the transformation and elevation of higher education in the state of Florida,” Rodrigues said. 
Florida International University follows through, votes for a Nuñez presidency

“FIU, I tell you this morning, that your president’s service to this institution began long before she was ever employed by you, going all the way back to the vision and foresight she had as a representative and then later as lieutenant governor,” Rodrigues said. 
DeSantis and U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio both recorded video messages congratulating Nuñez that played during the ceremony. 
“She served with distinction and she served ably” as lieutenant governor, DeSantis said, “but she is now in her element as the president of Florida International University down in Miami.”
Nuñez, 53, served in the Florida Legislature from 2010-2018 before serving six years as lieutenant governor, starting in 2019. 
She was named interim president in February and was permanent president in June.

Remarks
Nuñez spent part of her remarks honoring the six former presidents of FIU: Chuck Perry, Harold Crosby, Greg Wolfe, Modesto Maidique, Mark Rosenberg, and Kenneth Jessell. 
Maidique, for whom the main campus is named, Rosenberg, and Jessell were in attendance. 
“Each of these leaders fought their share of giants, convinced the naysayers, silenced the detractors and endeavored diligently to build the university I now have the privilege of leading,” Nuñez said.
Nuñez’s presidency was met with opposition, with the Faculty Senate representative Noël Barengo voting no, citing “deep concern about what we see as another effort by the governor’s office to interfere with public higher education.” He did vote in her favor for the permanent presidency. 
About a dozen public speakers appeared in the virtual meeting approving her as interim president in February, questioning the need for Jessell to step down before his contract expired and her partisan political involvement. One called Nuñez “a yes-woman for DeSantis’ dangerous agenda.”
FIU, 60 years old, was founded on the site of an old airport. Earlier this year, it received the highest rank for performance metrics among Florida’s public universities. 
“Looking forward to FIU’s next 50 years, I see boundless opportunity. I see the inevitability of FIU, a world-class university, a research powerhouse, but also a thriving marketplace of ideas. I see a place of intellectual inquiry and of academic rigor. A place where new ideas are born and students learn and challenge each other,” Nuñez said. 
Nuñez said her administration would double the university’s research expenditures. She also said she believes FIU will be a top 30 university by 2030. This year, U.S. News & World Report ranked it No. 46 among public universities and No. 97 among national universities. 
“Academic freedom is one of the pillars of higher education, and FIU is proud of the work we’ve done to honor this long-standing tradition,” Nuñez said. “But we must be vigilant in ensuring that our faculty fosters open dialogue and viewpoint diversity.”
Lawmakers and the governor have passed various pieces of legislation related to topics that may be taught in schools and which initiatives, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, may be funded with state dollars. State law also mandates a survey that tracks ideological moods on campus.
“Rather than telling our students what to think, faculty should welcome rigorous debate. Under my leadership, FIU will uphold diversity of thought, academic freedom, and civil discourse. FIU will never be a place where hateful and violent rhetoric devolve into chaos, nor will it be a place where a select few ideas will be tolerated,” she said.

The news comes as voters are already casting ballots on Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats. Early in-person voting is set to begin this weekend in many counties.
Federal personnel from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will be sent to Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. Harmeet Dhillon, the former vice chair of the California Republican Party and a Republican National Committee chairwoman, leads the division. 
It’s unclear whether the federal monitors will be onsite during early in-person voting or just on Nov. 4. The Justice Department has not said whether monitors will be stationed at polling places in addition to county elections offices. 
A spokesperson for the department did not respond to an emailed request for comment in time for publication. 
The request for election monitors came from the California Republican Party, the Associated Press reports. Chairwoman Corrin Rankin wrote a letter to Dhillon’s office on Monday, according to the AP. A spokesperson for the state party did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and text. 
Election observers are nothing out of the ordinary, and both parties regularly deploy poll watchers to ensure voting sites abide by state and federal election laws. 
The Justice Department also has a long history of monitoring jurisdictions that have track records of civil rights violations. Last November, leaders in some Republican states denied the Biden administration’s Justice Department personnel entry into some polling sites. 
“It’s entirely normal for the California Republican Party to request election integrity resources wherever they may be available,” said Bryan Watkins, a former senior adviser to the state party and its former chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson.
Watkins said the state GOP during his tenure welcomed poll monitors from the House Administration Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Convention. 
“If federal oversight gives voters confidence that their ballots will be secure and counted, I fully support it,” said Millan Patterson in a statement. She now is leading the campaign against Newsom’s Prop. 50.
California Democrats immediately denounced the request as a weaponization of the Justice Department against the state’s voters. 
“No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, in a statement. “Sadly, we’ve come to expect it from a so-called party that operates as more of a Trump fan club.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030320_SF_Voting_AW_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C721&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

Food banks and pantries are already bracing for the increased need, including in Iowa, where more than 270,000 Iowans rely on SNAP each month.However, even if Congress immediately reached a deal to end the shutdown, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means SNAP benefits would likely be delayed. State officials have warned SNAP recipients of the possibility of delays.In West Virginia, officials said delays are expected and told residents to seek assistance at local food pantries. Roughly 1 in 6 West Virginia residents rely on SNAP each month. Legal requirement citedSharon Parrott, a White House Office of Management and Budget official during the Obama administration who now leads a left-leaning think tank, said in a Thursday statement that USDA is legally required to use its SNAP contingency funds.Parrott, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the multi-year contingency fund is “billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown — to fund November benefits for the 1 in 8 Americans who need SNAP to afford their grocery bill.”Parrott said the Trump administration could use its legal transfer authority, just as it did with WIC funding, to “supplement the contingency reserves, which by themselves are not enough to fund families’ full benefits.”",,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Allina Doctors Council SEIU — comprising over 600 doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners — announced Friday that union members are calling a one-day unfair labor practices strike on November 5. 
“We’ve shown them that we’re really serious about this contract, that we need to see a contract that’s going to improve primary care,” said Matt Hoffman, a family doctor and union member. 
The strike will include all 61 primary care and urgent care clinics across Minnesota and western Wisconsin at Allina Health, one of the largest health systems in the Upper Midwest with a $5.8 billion in revenue in 2024. 
The strike could make Minnesota history as the first of its kind, union organizers said during a Friday press call. 
Doctors have not historically seen themselves in need of unionizing, but the broad trend of health care consolidation — hospitals and clinics combining into sprawling health systems like Allina — has led to worsening labor conditions even for physicians and other well paid practitioners. 
Allina doctors voted by a wide margin to unionize in October 2023 and picketed in June to voice frustration with what they called the “factory style” of modern medicine. 
The union is demanding a contract with higher wages, employment benefits written in ink and safe staffing levels, among other issues. The union says Allina has cut wages around 5% on average for physicians, though the precise number is hard to pin down due to variation across physician agreements. 
Allina released a statement, saying in part that “the union’s request for significant compensation increases and extreme benefits proposals are simply not realistic or sustainable,” citing rising costs and cuts to Medicaid passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in July.
“The bargaining table is where a responsible path forward for all parties can be found, and we have two bargaining sessions scheduled before the one-day strike is planned to occur,” the statement says.
The statement also says Allina is prepared to continue providing safe care during the one-day strike and will contact patients about changes to appointments.
Of particular concern to the doctors: Allina’s physicians do not have employment contracts, instead working for the health system under an employment agreement without time limits, said Nick VenOsdel, a pediatrician at Allina Health Hastings Clinic. The agreement includes a non-compete clause and “a lot of language in there [that] just says that Allina is allowed to change any components of that agreement at their discretion,” he said. 
Non-compete agreements were banned in Minnesota for contracts made after 2023, and the Minnesota Attorney General’s office is actively investigating another multistate health system for imposing non-competes on its physicians. 
Allina is closing four clinics in November, exacerbating the short-staffing of primary care clinics. Cora Walsh, who works at Allina’s West St. Paul clinic, said that the Inver Grove clinic closing has caused “a lot of concern at our clinic. We already have patients waiting to get in with providers here.” 
VenOsdel said the doctors and other providers “are just at our breaking points collectively. We feel like we’ve done everything we can to avoid getting up to this point even prior to unionizing,” he said. The union has engaged, he said, in “years of people trying to use appeal to logic, appeal to emotion, beg and plead to change things.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P1151760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

Donna sat in a recliner chair in a large, clean room, fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, hospital bed, TV, and even a small patio out the sliding glass door. But apparently, no waste baskets.
“They will provide one, but they charge extra. Or, you can bring one from home. So, I might as well just go home.”
“How much extra for a wastebasket?”
“I don’t know, but for $400 a day, you’d think you’d get a waste basket. And a washcloth and towel.”
“They don’t provide those either?”
“Nope.”
What the facility did provide was three square meals a day, two delivered to her room and one served in the communal dining room. Donna had to get there on her walker on her own.
“They only lay eyes on me twice a day, once when they bring my breakfast, and again when they bring my supper. I could die between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. and no one would know.”
“But what about physical therapy and occupational therapy?”
“Very little. And they’re in and out in 10 minutes. The physical therapist gave me a list of things I had to be able to do before I can go home. Stand up, sit down unattended. Check. Walk to the bathroom. Check. Heck, I’m walking to the dining room. Wash your face. How am I supposed to do that without a washcloth? I’m working my way down the list with the rest. Check, check, check.”
I knew what her family had decided, so I didn’t want to encourage this homeward movement, but frankly, it did sound better than lying in bed dead for hours at $400/day sans wastebaskets.
“And I’m so bored here. What’s happening to the lawn at home?”
Uh, oh. Donna’s mind had turned to lawn mowing. She loved mowing the lawn and had a state-of-the-art John Deere riding mower sitting in her garage. Through the years, I’d noticed that whenever she was stressed or wanted space from her husband, Stu, she mowed the lawn. All three acres. In the heat of the day. 95 to 115 degrees. It didn’t matter the temperature. She kept on mowing. Various neighbors had offered to help, but she refused any aid.
“Oh, don’t worry about your lawn,” I told Donna. “The neighbor guys have it covered.”

Three different neighborhood men were rotating through on their riding mowers. The men ranged in age from 13 to 60. One mowed each week, sometimes twice. The summer had been rainy, hot, and steamy, the grass growing fast. There had been no particular order to the rotation. The men would drive by on their way to somewhere else, notice the grass had gotten a little high, and within a couple of hours, it was cut. Sometimes, one neighbor would show up and mow on Monday, and another on Wednesday. I knew who was on the other side of the fence by the distinct sound of their Walker mowers.
I had covered Donna’s outside chores all summer. Once the gates were secured, Donna’s lambs grew nicely in her pasture, and her geese were waddling in and out of her pond. A Mennonite neighbor had brought in a crew to clean the whole house. A third young neighbor scrubbed down Donna’s garage so well that you could have eaten off the floor. Then he kept up with her garden that was cascading with ripening tomatoes.
“I’m almost done with the list,” Donna called me on the phone to alert me of her progress. “Coming home soon.”
Her daughter appeared later that same day. “She’ll never be able to go home. They won’t discharge her with a catheter.”
Good fences aren’t always what make good neighbors

The next week, I got the word. “Come and get me.”
Really? Oh, OK. I showed up in Donna’s nursing home room. She’d packed all her belongings in seven or eight large grocery bags. I went up to the nurses’ station to see if I could find a cart, but I was left to my own devices.
“Looks like I’ll make several trips,” I told Donna.
I carried all the bags out to my car, tucked in Donna’s small suitcase, and a couple of boxes of food that had been in the refrigerator. Finally, I helped Donna maneuver into the front seat, her catheter bag hanging from her walker. I figured that some arrangement had been made for maintaining this device. A visiting nurse, perhaps, was coming to the house. Surely, someone would be there that afternoon. Doors closed and locked, we headed out of the parking lot.
“Geez, the nurses weren’t too helpful about finding a cart.” I said.
“That’s because they’re mad I’m going home.”
“What? You didn’t have clearance for this move?”
“No.”
“Not from the doctors either?”
“No.”
“What about your family?”
“They are all against it.”
“What?”
“‘I hope you get along OK at home,” they said.
Oh, no, I thought. But get along OK at home she did. The first thing to go was the catheter.
“I was a nurse for 40 years,” Donna said. “I put in a million of these things. I certainly know how to take one out.”
Next, the physical and occupational therapists showed up at home and both forbade her from walking on the uneven grass.
“It just needs to be mowed,” Donna reassured them.
Then an Amish neighbor appeared in her black bonnet to start making meals. I’d defrosted some venison I’d found in Donna’s freezer, and the neighbor made enough small meals to last a month.
Next, Donna’s church sent a home health aide with two black crosses wired to the grill of her car. The aide took Donna to all her medical appointments. She got Donna up a high step and into the tiny shower in the mudroom. Once she was dry, Donna called the local plumber, telling him to rip out the bathtub and install a large walk-in shower in her regular bathroom.
Little by little, over the course of the next couple of months, Donna improved. The aide took Donna to Walmart for groceries. She took her to the bank, and around town to buy gift certificates for all the neighbors who had helped her. Soon, Donna was at the rec center walking around the track.
“I only made it around once,” Donna said, determined to do more laps.
Still, tiredness plagued her. Some days she woke up in the morning, had breakfast, then fell back in bed asleep. Her blood pressure plummeted and I tried to take her back to the hospital, but she refused.
“Oh, my blood pressure goes up and down,” she said.
Finally, she had a long-awaited appointment with a cardiologist and was fitted with a heart monitor. A week later, she swallowed a pill to address a heart arrhythmia issue.
Then suddenly, her car reappeared in her drive.
“What’s this?” I asked.
“I’ll just drive to church and back,” she promised.
What she didn’t mention was dealing with the lawn. One late afternoon, I was cleaning up my garden, readying it for winter, when I heard the distinct sound of a mower drifting over the fence. And not a Walker mower. A John Deere mower. Donna’s John Deere mower.
“Hey, what’s going on over there?” I called.
But Donna didn’t hear me. She sat in the mower seat, earphones on her head, blocking out all other sound. Back and forth, she mowed the front yard, around the mailbox, around the bird feeder poles, and the flower beds. She mowed through the backyard, the racket shooing her geese toward the pond. Back and forth, and back and forth, Donna mowed, the sun shooting its descending rays down through the trees.

A federal judge ordered them to be removed. (Screenshot from court documents)A federal judge on Friday ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from Lakeside School District, two days after he permitted the Garland County district to be added to a lawsuit challenging a new state law requiring the displays. 
Following passage of Act 573 of 2025 this spring, public schools are now required to “prominently” display a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments in classrooms and libraries. The posters must be donated or bought with funds from voluntary contributions. The law also requires them to be displayed in public colleges and universities and other public buildings maintained by taxpayer funds.
Seven Northwest Arkansas families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed a lawsuit in June challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The families allege the state law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
Supporters of the law have argued the tenets have historical significance because they influenced the country’s founders in creating the nation’s laws and legal system.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks granted a preliminary injunction in August that blocked implementation of the statute in four districts — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale. 
Brooks later allowed the Conway School District to be added to the suit as a defendant and district families as plaintiffs. He also ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from the district’s schools and converted a temporary restraining order against the district into a preliminary injunction. 
A temporary restraining order temporarily halts an action and may be issued immediately, without informing all parties and without holding a hearing. It’s intended to last until a court holds a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, according to Cornell Law School. 
After Brooks granted permission Wednesday to add Lakeside School District as a defendant and Christine Benson and her minor child as plaintiffs in the case, attorneys for the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction on Thursday. 
Brooks granted the temporary restraining order Friday and held the preliminary injunction in abeyance. He also temporarily blocked Lakeside from complying with the law and ordered the district to remove Ten Commandments displays from its schools by 5 p.m. Monday. 
“A temporary restraining order should issue as to Lakeside School District No. 9,” Brooks wrote in Friday’s order. “Lakeside Plaintiffs are identically situated to the original Plaintiffs: They advance the same legal arguments, assert the same constitutional injuries, and request the same relief.”
Defendants and the attorney general’s office, which intervened in the case, have until Nov. 3 to submit briefs to address why the existing preliminary injunction should not be modified to include Lakeside School District as a defendant, according to Friday’s order.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Two former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency leaders joined students and community members at Duke University to speak on advancing environmental goals in the face of federal resistance to climate change regulation.
At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions. 
Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts. 
As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders. 
Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results. 
“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said. 
Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board. 
Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website. 
In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.
While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.
To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas. 
“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said. 
A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators. 
“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4387-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The House speaker stripped an Oklahoma City Democrat of her committee assignments Friday following a lawsuit against her from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he removed Rep. Ajay Pittman from four committees, including tourism, agriculture, energy and natural resources, and the health budget subcommittee, at the recommendation of his chamber’s Democratic Caucus.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, confirmed Friday that her caucus has recommended the temporary suspension. She said that the House Democratic Caucus has also suspended Pittman from its membership and activities pending the outcome of an Attorney General investigation. 
Pittman did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office is also investigating Pittman and recently served a search warrant for her office at the Capitol, but a spokesperson said Friday the warrant is sealed. He did not respond to a question about the subject of the investigation. 
The Ethics Commission lawsuit alleges that Pittman committed fraud and breach of contract by filing fake documents to settle a previous ethics investigation. The Commission is seeking civil relief through the Oklahoma County District Court.
Pittman previously settled with the Ethics Commission for improperly using campaign funds for personal use and agreed to pay $35,000. She failed to comply with the settlement agreement, leading to further investigation by the Commission and the eventual lawsuit, officials said. 
A court filing alleges Pittman provided the Commission a letter from her landlord that was actually created by her mother, former state lawmaker Anastasia Pittman, indicating that her campaign records had been destroyed by water damage. 
The lawsuit also alleges Pittman submitted a falsified check to the Commission as proof of a payment from her personal funds as outlined in the settlement agreement.
“These are serious findings from the Ethics Commission, in addition to an ongoing criminal investigation, so I feel this additional step is warranted,” Hilbert said in a statement. 
Hilbert previously removed her from the State Tribal Relations Committee. 
Munson said the allegations against Pittman are “severe enough” to warrant action.
“The House Democratic Caucus remains committed to accountability and transparency for all elected officials and we will continue to focus on serving all constituents and solving problems for everyday Oklahomans,” Munson said.

Ron DeSantis dismissed a slate of proposed constitutional amendments from House Republicans to lower or eliminate property taxes, a South Florida Democrat has unveiled his own ideas for the 2026 legislative session.
“As property tax bills arrive for families around Florida, living in our state feels more expensive than ever,” said state Sen. Mack Bernard, D-West Palm Beach, in a press release Friday. “That’s why I’ve filed these property tax relief proposals — because voters should have a chance to decide on what the best financial relief is for themselves.”

Bernard’s legislative package includes one bill and four joint resolutions. A joint resolution needs to be approved by three-fifths of each chamber in the Legislature to become a proposed constitutional amendment, which then needs 60% support from the public to become law. Bills need simple majority votes and approval by the governor.
These are the five proposals:
SJR 270 — Would exempt the non-school portion of property tax for Florida seniors aged 65 and older who have claimed a homestead exemption for a minimum of five years and whose annual income does not exceed $350,000.
SJR- 274 — Would provide additional homestead property tax benefits for long-term homeowners. It says that assessed value cannot increase after 20 years of ownership and residency; and it would provide homeowners after 30 years of ownership and residency with an additional homestead exemption equal to 50% of the property’s assessed value.
SJR-278 — Would cap the assessed value increase of new homestead properties after a change in ownership at 150% of the property’s prior year assessed value, provided the assessed value was under $500,000, for ad valorem purposes.
SJR 282 — Would limit the assessed value of real property to 3% or the percentage change in the consumer price index, whichever is lower, if the property is owned and used for commercial purposes by a small business.
Bernard is also sponsoring a bill (SB 286) that would allow Florida residents to make changes, additions, or improvements to their homestead without increasing the assessed value of the property if the total just value of changes, additions, or improvements is less than $100,000.
In offering his proposals on Friday, Bernard becomes the first Democrat in the Legislature to weigh in substantively on property tax reform. Property taxes have become a leading issue for DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, who have promised that Floridians will have the opportunity to vote to either severely reduce or outright ban property taxes on homesteads.
However, they have not stated exactly what would come before the voters next year.
To fill that void, seven Florida House Republicans offered their own joint resolutions to reduce property taxes a week ago. But DeSantis essentially dismissed their substance on Wednesday night, noting in a social media post that “placing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,” adding that it was “a political game, not a serious attempt to get it done for the people.”
That irked House Speaker Daniel Perez, who responded in a statement Thursday asking where were DeSantis’ proposals?
“So when the Governor says he wants to ‘abolish’ property taxes. How? We don’t have any details,” he said.
“But what the House does have is a proposal that reflects the Governor’s comments in the media and can garner the support of voters in November — the elimination of non-school property taxes on all homesteaded properties, in addition to a range of possible ballot initiatives — some to offer tax cuts, and some to fix broken parts of the system. We offered multiple proposals in good faith because it is unclear to us what — if anything — any other party is willing to do.”
Bernard, an attorney, was elected to represent Senate District 24 in Palm Beach County in a special election in 2024. He previously served in the Florida House between 2009-2012.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan, who is running an independent campaign for Michigan governor in the 2026 election cycle, is gaining traction among voters, according to a new poll released Friday from Schoen Cooperman Research. 
The poll of 600 likely November 2026 voters in Michigan shows Duggan with the support of 26% of voters — while top Democratic candidate Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson sits at 30% and top Republican candidate U.S. Rep. John James having 29% of voter support. 
A statement from Duggan’s campaign called the poll a demonstration of him “rapidly closing the gap on the top Republican and Democrat candidates statewide.”
The margin of error for the poll is 4%, placing Duggan within that margin. 
“We are building a coalition of support unlike anything this state has seen before, pulling unprecedented support from Democrats and Republicans. We’re winning unions, chambers of commerce, clergy and elected officials,” said campaign manager Ed Duggan in a statement from the campaign. 
The statement also pointed to Duggan’s job approval statewide as the mayor of Detroit, where 63% of Democrats — the party that he ran under for all three of his mayoral terms — and 47% of Republicans approved. 
The poll also showed Duggan with a higher net favorability rating compared to Benson, James, and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist — though all did have net positive ratings among voters. 
“Another poll, another lead for Jocelyn Benson,” Benson’s campaign manager Nikki Goldschein wrote to the Advance in response to the polling. “Michiganders want leaders who can take on broken systems and fix them to make life easier for people across the state — not politicians who attack and divide. That’s why voters keep putting Jocelyn on top, while John James and Mike Duggan are left fighting to keep up.” 
Internal Benson campaign polling also shows Duggan much further behind Benson or James, over 15 points behind either of those candidates.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)With just over a month before its lease is set to expire, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) has been given the state’s OK to remain at its downtown Providence headquarters for another decade.
The State Properties Committee voted 4-1 Thursday to approve a new 10-year, $24 million lease keeping the department in its converted factory headquarters in Providence’s Jewelry District, much to the frustration of the more than dozen current and former workers who attended the two-hour meeting inside a Department of Administration conference room.
For months, workers organized under SEIU Local 580 have claimed the office building at 101 Friendship St. has poor ventilation, leaks, heating issues, and infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors — along with recent bat sightings.
Speaking to the committee, the department’s director, Ashley Deckert, acknowledged that the building “has not been without its challenges,” but that officials have been working with the building’s owner to address issues as they arise.
“While not every challenge can be solved overnight, I’m confident that the building is in a strong operational position,” Deckert said. She added that the department had gone “above and beyond” to make the building safe, functional and welcoming. 
But Matthew Gunnip, president of SEIU Local 580, said that’s not the reality his 300 union members face — showing the committee enlarged photos of buckets filled with brown water, rotting wood, and soot-covered pipes.
“DCYF’s representations were insincere,” he said in an interview after the meeting. “There’s not much transparency.”

Tensions over the building caused the department to miss a key deadline to renew its lease. Under the previous 10-year agreement, the state had to sign a new deal by July 31 to extend it for another decade.
The State Properties Committee was initially set to vote on the renewal July 22, but union pushback prompted the panel to delay the decision pending results from an air quality test. A second vote, scheduled for July 29, was postponed again to allow for a public hearing — a rare step for the committee that reviews state leases.
“Even though we meet in public, we do not normally meet with public comment,” Committee Chairman Marco Schiappa said in his opening remarks.
And in another deviation from the norm, the committee posted years of documentation, including air quality and pest control reports, for the public to view and submit questions to the panel.
Schiappa said the public didn’t submit any questions ahead of Thursday’s meeting. But when the committee opened up for comment, current and former employees spoke of the building’s poor conditions that they say remain and have contributed to health problems among employees.
Diane Winckelium, a former social worker who worked in the building from 1997 to 2009, said she was sick “at least on a monthly basis.”
“I had constant sore throats, sinus infections, [and] severe fatigue,” she said. “Ulitimately I had to undergo a procedure to have tube placed up my ears just to cope.”
It wasn’t until she left the department, she said, that her symptoms finally disappeared, except for her sinusitis. 
“I am stuck with that for life,” Winckelium said.
Debra Bonner, a retired child protective investigator, said she had never had allergies until she worked in the Friendship Street offices between 2002 and 2020. She told the committee she has since been diagnosed with cancer, which she believes came from working in the office building.
“All the vents in that building had black soot,” she said.
State and building officials maintain the air quality is safe, citing recent reports — including a Sept. 5 analysis by R.I. Analytical Laboratories, Inc. — that measured particulates, carbon dioxide, dander, and mold, all found to be within normal levels for an office environment.
“The bottom line is that we found a generally clean, maintained building,” Kenneth Davis, a senior environmental scientist for the lab, told the committee.
But Gunnip said the union was not alerted to the findings of that report until Oct. 14. He requested the committee again delay action until the union could get a third-party look at the building.

Nicholas Vaz, representing Attorney General Peter Neronha on the panel, called the request reasonable and worth exploring. He was the lone vote against the extension. But public member Robert Donovan, who moved to approve the lease, warned it would lead to “analysis paralysis” and push a final decision even closer to the Nov. 30 lease expiration.
“All the parties have been given ample time to present experts,” he said.
With the new lease, officials promised improvements including new carpets and paint throughout the majority of the building, new flooring in the lobby and main entrance area, new window blinds, and water fountains with filtration units installed on each floor.
Deckert said the department is also working with building manager Provident Property to establish a maintenance request system that lets employees track when a request is made, who it is assigned to, and when it is completed. 
“Creating a better communication pathway is a priority,” she said.
Gunnip still remains skeptical that this will be the case, adding that he was appalled by the State Properties Committee’s vote.
“There was no acknowledgement of what was reported by the workers,” he said. “It seemed like the vote was taken even before we had the hearing.”

Alex Mercer)New Mexico environment officials announced Friday that approximately 100 homes in Curry County will have a new water source to lessen their exposure to toxic PFAS in their drinking wells from nearby Cannon Air Force Base.
The state environment department said it will be awarding a $12 million state legislative appropriation for the project to EPCOR, which runs water and wastewater services in Eastern New Mexico, and is a major utilities provider in the U.S. and Canada. The company operates more than 41,000 connections in Clovis, according to the state’s drinking water website.
The move comes in response to the state’s PFAS blood testing initiative in the area that found that 99.7% of the 628 participants had PFOS — the form of PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances) widely used in military firefighting foam — in their blood. The state’s report also found New Mexicans working or living closer to the PFAS-contaminated groundwater plume under Cannon had PFAS levels that were three times higher than residents not working or living near the plume.
Studies on PFAS’ health impacts remain ongoing, but exposure has thus far been linked to kidney and reproductive cancers, decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, disruption of immune responses and liver functions in people.
The project will extend EPCOR’s existing water system east of the base to include members of Curry County. The connections will be voluntary, requiring households to opt-in, according to a news release on the project. In a statement, state Environment Secretary James Kenney said that connecting to EPCOR’s water lines would be “the best way for Curry County residents to receive drinking water that meets or exceeds all state and federal standards.”
In a joint statement, Republican lawmakers from the Clovis and Broadview areas said they were “excited” to see movement on the $12 million project they set funds aside for in the 2025 legislative session.
“PFAS contamination has impacted the health and wellbeing of our families near Cannon Air Force Base and finding real solutions is critical,” Minority Whip Sen. Pat Woods, Sen. Pat Boone, Rep. Martin Zamora, and Rep. Andrea Reeb said in a joint statement.
New Mexico remains embroiled in several lawsuits with the U.S. Department of Defense over PFAS contamination, and is part of multi-state litigation in South Carolina.
The state is also involved in separate litigation in the federal court system, after the U.S. Department of Defense sued the state’s environment department, claiming New Mexico overstepped its authority in mandating cleanup.
In yet another case filed this year, state officials alleged Cannon Air Force illegally barred state inspectors entry to the base to test for PFAS, violating a new state law. A Department of Defense’s request to move that case forward in federal court remains on hold pending a ruling on whether the case should be incorporated into the multi-state litigation in South Carolina.

Vermont’s state chapters of the Republican and Democratic parties could both see new leadership next month after the parties hold their biennial reorganization meetings.
Paul Dame, the incumbent chair of the Vermont Republican Party, is running for a third term but facing a challenge from a somewhat unconventional opponent: a sitting state senator. Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, is vying to lead the party with a pitch that it could do more to recruit down-ballot candidates and deepen its ties with younger voters. 
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Jim Ramsey — who’s served as interim party chair since February — said Wednesday that he will not be seeking the job on a permanent basis. Ramsey was elected to the role after former chair David Glidden resigned.
“Over the course of the past few months, my work commitments outside of the VDP have been increasing, and much of it is occurring away from Vermont, particularly in Washington, DC.,” Ramsey wrote in an email to other party leaders last week.
Vermont Democrats will elect a new chair on Nov. 15, while the GOP will elect a new leader on Nov. 8. Both chairs will be chosen by the members of each party’s state committees, which largely consist of delegates selected at the county level. 
The Democratic state committee is slated to have about 45 members this year, while the GOP state committee will likely have about 110, party leaders said. 
‘A winning team’
Dame was first elected GOP chair in 2021, and he was reelected to the two-year post in 2023. Like Ingalls, he said he’s running to build on sweeping gains the party made in the Vermont House and Senate in last fall’s elections that dismantled Democratic supermajorities in both chambers.
For Dame’s part, though, he thinks a leadership change won’t help win more seats. He acknowledged that the party’s gains were largely thanks to campaigning by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, though believes his relationship with the governor played a role, too. 
“I think when you’ve got a winning team, you want to be very careful about mixing things up,” said Dame, who lives in St. George and runs a retirement planning company.
Despite those gains, recent history gives Republicans some reason to be wary. During the last midterm elections in 2022, the party lost substantial ground to Democrats after winning a handful of new seats in 2020 — albeit, not the wave they won last year. It’s not entirely clear what impact President Donald Trump’s popularity, or the popularity of policies backed by Trump’s GOP allies in Congress, might have on the 2026 race. 
The state Republican Party has also faced a scandal over the past two weeks that could factor into the chair race. State Sen. Sam Douglass, R-Orleans, resigned from his seat after he was exposed in a Politico report as a member of a group chat with other young Republicans from around the country that exchanged racial slurs and other derogatory messages.  
Gov. Scott issued a press release calling for Douglass to resign the evening of the day the Politico report was published. The following day, Ingalls was the lead signatory on a statement signed by several Northeast Kingdom legislators calling for the same, adding, “these comments have no place within our society as a whole and will not be tolerated.”
Douglass formally submitted notice of his resignation to Vermont’s Senate secretary, John Bloomer, on Wednesday.
For his part, Dame had not immediately called for Douglass to resign from his Senate seat. He called the group chat “shocking and grotesque” in a statement the following day but suggested that remarks attributed to Douglass in the Politico story were not bigoted or racist. Hours later, however, the executive committee of the state GOP issued a press release with a “full, complete retraction” of Dame’s statement.
“The Vermont Republican Party (“VTGOP”) Executive Committee stands united with Governor Phil Scott and the Republican Senate and House leadership and calls for the immediate resignation of Senator Sam Douglass,” they wrote in the release.
The party’s executive committee includes Dame as well as the party’s vice chair, treasurer and secretary, along with Republican state legislators and other members appointed by the larger state committee, according to the party’s governing rules. 
In an interview on Vermont Public’s midday radio show, Vermont Edition, on Monday, Dame, who served in the House from 2015 to 2017, pushed back on the notion that his values were not aligned with those of the rest of the committee. He said he was hesitant to jump to conclusions about Douglass’ intentions, and that he issued the statement he felt comfortable with given all the information he had at the time.
“Part of what I’ve been trying to do in my term as chair is, trying to find what is a standard that we can hold all of our elected officials to — and, how do we begin to apply that equally, in a nonpartisan way?” he said on the radio.
A senator’s challenge
Ingalls has served in the state Senate since 2019 and currently chairs the chamber’s Agriculture Committee. He is well-known as one of the chamber’s most conservative voices. 
Ingalls faced criticism from the state’s Democratic Party in April when he was one of a handful of members of the chamber to vote against a resolution condemning the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student activist and years-long Upper Valley resident, by masked federal immigration agents in Colchester. The Columbia University student, who was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, was later ordered released by a Vermont federal judge.
To be sure, Ingalls also represents some of the state’s most politically conservative areas. In Essex County, which makes up most of his district, 55% of voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared with 33% on average statewide. 
“I have spoken to far too many of you who feel disenfranchised with the direction of our Party and its leadership,” Ingalls said in a social media post announcing his candidacy last week, a day before the Politico story was published. “I hear you and commit to making sure that your values and ideals are reflected in the Party that you love.”
In addition to serving in the Legislature, Ingalls owns a real estate business and operates a group of radio stations in and around his Northeast Kingdom district. Over the summer, Ingalls decided to switch the brief newscasts that play at the top of the hour on his stations from stories produced by Associated Press or the major broadcasters ABC, CBS and NBC to Fox News.
Dame, in an interview, questioned whether Ingalls would be able to devote his time fully to serving as party chair in addition to all those different roles.
“I think that he’s too important in the role that he’s in to have his attention divided with everything that comes with this job,” Dame said, referring to Ingalls’ Senate seat. Republicans have a minority of seats but enough to sustain vetoes by Gov. Scott.
For a moment this month, a third candidate also had his hat in the ring for state GOP chair: Joe Gervais, the current chair of the Bennington County Republicans who has run, unsuccessfully, for both the House and Senate. Gervais announced his bid for chair on Oct. 2, but last week, he reneged on that idea and endorsed Ingalls’ bid instead, he said in an email.
Ingalls did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
A new Democratic chair
While Republicans will be focused on maintaining — and attempting to boost — the number of seats they have in both chambers next year, Ramsey, the outgoing Democratic chair, said his party will focus on messaging to voters that characterizes Scott, and other Republican leaders, as an inadequate safeguard against the Trump administration. 
It’s not clear yet whether any of Vermont’s statewide Democratic incumbents — namely, Treasurer Mike Pieciak or Attorney General Charity Clark — will announce a bid for governor for 2026. Scott has not said yet whether he plans to seek what would be his sixth term in the office.
Ramsey said his increasing work commitments in Washington, D.C., stem largely from his and his wife’s work with organizations that advocate for research on brain health. He said that work has taken on new urgency amid the Trump administration’s efforts to slash public health research. The couple plans to move to Washington, D.C. full time but keep a second home in Manchester, Ramsey said.
Glidden, the former Democratic chair, announced he was resigning from the job in November 2024, triggering a midcycle election for the role. Ramsey beat out Andy Julow, who was appointed to a state Senate seat in May 2024 but then lost in the general election that fall to a Republican challenger. The party chair vote was 38-7, according to Ramsey.
Julow said in a text message Wednesday that he does not plan to seek the job again. Ramsey said he wasn’t immediately aware of other candidates who had publicly declared their intention to run.
Ramsey appeared to receive at least some scrutiny during his time as chair over fundraising efforts. A report from the Vermont Democratic Party’s treasurer last month, which was reviewed by VTDigger, stated that staff added a specific line for party fundraising tied to the chair. Between January and August, the chair had raised “$0 against a budgeted (expected) revenue of $6500,” the report states. The line was added “in response to requests for more fundraising transparency,” it states.
Ramsey said he was aware of that line item but pushed back on the idea that it was a criticism of his work as chair. He said he did not think it painted a complete picture of the work he’d done since taking on the role. He compared the $6,500 figure to the party’s total revenue over the same time period which, per the report, was about $227,000, saying the former would have been a small drop in the bucket.
“I’ve done a lot of work with emails, letters, meetings, calls, other stuff,” Ramsey said. “There has been quite a bit of activity on my part.”

When bulldozers began to tear down the East Wing of the White House this week to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s $250 million ballroom, historians raised alarms that important American history was being buried in the rubble, including chapters about previous first ladies and their roles uplifting women going back nearly a century.
Among the offices housed in the East Wing is the Office of the First Lady, first professionalized by Eleanor Roosevelt during her husband’s administration. Roosevelt used the East Wing for official functions, as a base of operations for her activism and as a space for interacting with groups representing the American people, from the Girl Scouts to the Women’s Trade Union League.
Betty Ford argued to increase pay for her staff in the East Wing. Rosalynn Carter became the first first lady to keep her own office there, in 1977. It was also in the East Wing that Laura Bush launched her literacy efforts, and where Michelle Obama oversaw her “Let’s Move” campaign.
Katherine A.S. Sibley, a professor of history at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, said that before Carter, first ladies had offices in the presidential residence, often in their bedrooms. Roosevelt establishing a staff and presence in the East Wing — and subsequent first ladies having dedicated staff and their own offices there — were acknowledgements of the significant role presidential spouses play on key initiatives.

“To me, this demolition suggests that the current White House does not think that the first lady does anything of value,” Sibley said. “I’m not talking about [Melania Trump] particularly, but the office itself — they’re not cognizant of the history.”
The demolition of the East Wing took many by surprise. In July, when Trump signed the executive order authorizing the construction of the ballroom, he said: “It won’t interfere with the current building. … It’ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.”
The ballroom is being financed by contributions from private companies with business before the Trump administration, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Lockheed Martin and OpenAI, according to news reports. At a dinner with donors last week, Trump said: “Everything out there is coming down and we’re replacing it with one of the most beautiful ballrooms you’ve ever seen.”

The National Capitol Planning Commission, an Executive Branch agency that Congress tasked with having a “comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital,” is now chaired by a top Trump aide, Will Scharf. He has said the commission does not have oversight over demolition, it only approves construction.
The agency’s website states that it is closed due to the ongoing government shutdown. The 19th received an automated response to its email to the White House press office, saying there are staffing shortages and they are unable to respond to all inquiries, also citing the government shutdown.
In a statement released Monday night, the White House characterized the response to the East Wing demolition as the “latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies … clutching their pearls over President Donald Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom.”
Former East Wing staffers told East Wing Magazine that seeing the offices where they once worked torn down was “jarring,” a “gut punch” and “revolting.” Members of the Nixon administration asked the White House to stop the renovation or at least allow them to provide input on the preservation of artifacts. One said they feared a “time capsule” they had installed near a window would be destroyed.

Historian Alexis Coe told The 19th that “serious work would happen” in the East Wing, “on issues that were significant to the American population.”
From the East Wing, Roosevelt expanded the role of first lady, working to highlight women with intention. Her first news conference, on March 6, 1933, featured 35 reporters, all of them women. During her tenure, she held nearly 350 news conferences, helping to elevate the role of women in national and political life, as well as in journalism.
People have also historically chosen to protest outside the East Wing as a way of making themselves seen and getting the attention of the first lady, including on the issue of civil rights in the 1960s, which Lady Bird Johnson supported.
“Serious work is not going to happen there anymore. This is another instance in which Trump has said one thing — that the East Wing would not be altered — and he’s altering it,” Coe said.

(Photo: Wes Muller/LA Illuminator)A Canadian mining company plans to build a facility in Calcasieu Parish to refine rare earth metals used in a variety of motors and electronics in the consumer, technology and defense industries.
Aclara Resources Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced a $277 million investment to construct the first U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton, according to a Friday news release from Louisiana Economic Development. 
The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits. 
Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications. 
Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews. 
“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”
The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish. 
Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. 
Aclara boasts what it calls a sustainable mining process that uses no explosives, milling or wastewater ponds. The company says it recirculates 95% of the water it uses for mining and plants trees after razing the land. It plans to begin its mining operations in Chile in 2027 and in Brazil in 2028, according to the company’s website.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — The process of converting a state prison in McCook into a state-run, federal immigration detention facility is allowed to proceed for now as a district judge considers a motion seeking a temporary injunction filed by McCook residents and a former state lawmaker.
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng heard arguments Friday on the temporary injunction motion, as well as the state’s subsequent motion to dismiss filed earlier this week. He did not make an immediate ruling on either but indicated he would rule “soon” on the motion to dismiss.
The 24-page lawsuit argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. The case names Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system.

“This case is not about immigration, it’s about our constitutional Republican form of government,” said Nick Grandgenett, attorney for Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs.
Nebraska signed a two-year 183-page contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sept. 30 to convert the camp into an ICE detention facility.
The lead plaintiff, former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor.
The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility.
Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Arguments Friday largely centered around a provision of the state Constitution that reads, “The general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory, and penal institutions shall be vested as determined by the Legislature.”
Each side of the case had different interpretations of the provision. Lincoln Korell, an attorney representing the state, argued the Legislature had already granted this authority to Corrections, granting the state — or in this case the administration — the ability to enter the contract.
Robbie McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, argued that Corrections was granted the power to house incarcerated people within state law. Because the agreement pertains to Nebraska housing immigrant detainees for ICE, he argued that it requires separate legislative approval.

Grandgenett further argued that Pillen and Jeffreys entering the contract violates the Legislature’s authority to appropriate state funds. State senators often refer to the Legislature’s jurisdiction being “the power of the purse.” He cited Nebraska’s unlawful expenditure doctrine, which refers to taxpayers’ ability to sue to prevent the illegal expenditure of public funds.
Korell noted that the federal government plans to reimburse Nebraska on many expenses related to the project. The contract states that ICE plans to pay Nebraska at least $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees — adult males and females — at the camp. It includes a daily bed rate of $269.17 per detainee. In the second year, minimum ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.
The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only males.
Pillen’s office estimated the contract would net Nebraska about $14.25 million per year. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.” Work has already begun to make adjustments to the property. Corrections contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor wire-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month.

Grandgenett countered that it doesn’t matter if the feds will reimburse Nebraska, because the state will still have to make the initial expenditures that he contends will cause “irreparable harm.”
“It’s the ‘unlawful expenditure doctrine,’ it’s not the ‘unlawful expenditure unless you make a profit doctrine,’” Grandgenett said.
Joe McKechnie, another attorney for the state, argued that even if the state backs out of the agreement, there still would be plenty of expenses Nebraska would have to shoulder, including the fencing updates.
“The immigration detainees in Nebraska will still have to be detained somewhere,” McKechnie said.
Korell argued Heng should dismiss the case for several reasons. He said the Red Willow County District Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, because the lawsuit excludes several parties with interest in the project. Korell argued that if the plaintiffs are successful, that would effectively terminate the contract, which would impact both the federal government and Outback Fence.
McEwen said this perspective could lead to a slippery slope in which every associated organization to the project would need to be included in the case, like food vendors and other contracted businesses. He argued the case concerns the state’s authority to enter the contract, so the state should be the primary party.
Korell also argued plaintiffs used broad justifications about their motives for bringing the case. To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”
While Korell acknowledged these are legitimate reasons to file a suit, he argued they are meant to be interpreted narrowly. He said plaintiffs need to show they face an imminent injury as a result of the project, which could apply to federal detainees or state inmates relocated for the project, but not McCook residents.

“Nebraska courts aren’t a stage just for any person to air their grievances against any other person,” Korell said.
In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.
Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”
Heng did not offer a timeline as to when he expects to make his rulings, but indicated he would rule on the state’s motion to dismiss first.

Notably, eight of the 19 districts rated D, F or not rated at all are charter schools. Our state’s national ranking for K–12 achievement has climbed from 50th to 16th, and Mississippi now leads the nation in early literacy gains and fourth-grade reading growth. These results were not achieved through privatization or vouchers. They were  achieved through focus, consistency and intentionality by teachers and administrators across our state.
When a system is continuously improving, research is clear—now is not the time to blow it up. It is the time to double down on what works.
The path forward for Mississippi lies in refining and strengthening our current educational system, not  abandoning it for one that lacks accountability or proven results. 
Accountability should apply to everyone  
Public schools in Mississippi operate under one of the most transparent and rigorous accountability systems in the nation. Every school and district receives an annual letter grade — A through F — based on clear, publicly reported indicators such as student  achievement, academic growth, graduation rates and college and career readiness.
Those results are not hidden in a report or spreadsheet. They are published statewide each year, tied directly to state and federal funding decisions and used to guide support and improvement efforts.
When schools fall short, the state steps in. The Mississippi Department of Education provides targeted assistance, professional development and intervention strategies to help struggling schools improve.
Local school boards are required to discuss results in open meetings, and the public has full access to performance data by school, grade and subgroup. In short, the public knows exactly how their schools are performing and can hold leaders — like me — accountable for results.
Private schools receiving taxpayer-funded vouchers, however, face none of these same expectations. They are not required to administer state assessments aligned with Mississippi’s academic standards, report graduation rates or publish any data showing whether students are actually learning. They are not required to have certified teachers.
There are no annual report cards, no performance frameworks and no transparency measures that allow parents or taxpayers to see results.
That lack of oversight raises a serious question. If public money is funding private education, how are families — or lawmakers — supposed to know whether “school choice” is actually working? Without data, there is no way to compare outcomes or determine whether students receiving vouchers are gaining ground, standing still or falling behind.
If public dollars are going to private institutions, the public deserves to know what they’re getting in return. Accountability should not stop at the schoolhouse door simply because the sign out front doesn’t say “public.”
Transparency is not a punishment. It’s a promise. It’s the reason Mississippi’s public education system has achieved record gains in the last decade.
We turned years of stagnation into a story of improvement precisely because we were willing to measure results, confront reality and act on what the data showed. If accountability has helped strengthen our public schools, shouldn’t it be expected of any school that receives public funds? 
The cost of disruption  
Universal school choice would drain critical resources from public schools – the very institutions that anchor our communities.
When public dollars follow students out the door, the schools left behind still carry the same responsibilities: Teaching every child who walks through their doors, keeping class sizes manageable and providing programs in the arts, athletics and career-technical education. What disappears are the resources to sustain that work.
Unlike public schools, private schools that receive vouchers are not required to serve all children. They can – and often do – set admissions criteria that exclude students with disabilities, English language learners or those with behavioral or academic challenges.
Private schools may decline to provide transportation, limit access for low-income families or charge additional fees beyond the voucher amount. That’s not freedom or fairness; that’s selective access.
Public schools, by contrast, open their doors to every child, every day. They are the great equalizer – places where opportunity is not limited by income, background or ability. Public schools don’t get to choose their students. They simply choose to serve  them all.
In every community, the public school is more than a building. It’s a gathering place, a unifying symbol and a promise that every child deserves a fair start. To weaken that promise by diverting funds to institutions that operate without the same responsibility or transparency is to risk unraveling one of the most essential threads in the fabric of our state. 
A better path forward 
At its core, education is a public good, not a consumer good. It exists not to serve individual preference but to ensure the collective well-being of our communities and the strength of our democracy.
Public education thrives on shared responsibility,  transparency and inclusion – values that cannot be reduced to marketplace competition or transactional choice. 
When we begin to treat education as a commodity to be bought and sold, we risk eroding the foundation of equal opportunity and civic unity that has anchored this nation for more than a century. Public schools are where our children learn not only  academics, but empathy, cooperation and the responsibilities of citizenship. 
Mississippi’s recent success story proves what’s possible when we invest in what works — early literacy, teacher development, career pathways and continuous  improvement.
Rather than expanding programs that siphon resources away from public schools, we should continue building on the practices that have moved Mississippi from the bottom of national rankings to one of the most improved states in the country.
The future of Mississippi’s children depends on the decisions we make today. If we want every child, in every community, to have a fair shot at success, we must protect and strengthen our public schools. Let’s continue to refine what’s working instead of dismantling a system that is finally moving in the right direction. 
Education is not a marketplace — it’s a promise. And that promise belongs to every child in Mississippi.

Attorney General Dave Sunday announced seven people have been charged with violations of the Election Code and Voter Registration Law and related offenses stemming from an investigation that started in Lancaster County last October. Sunday took office in January.
Guillermo Sainz, 33, of Sierra Vista, Arizona, was charged with three counts of soliciting registrations, which is a misdemeanor violation of the Election Code regarding offering financial incentives for achieving registration quotas. Sainz worked as director of a company’s registration drive efforts in Pennsylvania, the Attorney General’s Office said. It did not identify the company in a news release.

Also charged are Amos Clay, Anya McCurdy, Meghan McDevitt, Richard Perez and Samantha Szukiewicz. Each is charged with felony tampering with public records and unsworn falsification, forgery and two crimes under the state’s Elections Code and Voter Registration law, all misdemeanors. Szukiewicz is also charged with identity theft.
Court documents detailing the charges were still being processed Friday afternoon, according to an official at the district court in Lancaster County where the charges were filed.
“We are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,” Sunday said. “Pennsylvanians should have peace of mind that the election process worked in this case.”
Election workers in Lancaster County flagged about 2,500 applications last year that appeared to have the same handwriting and were filled out on the same day. Some of the applications were for previously registered voters and the signatures on the documents did not match those the county had on file, Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said at the time.
Officials in Berks, York and Monroe counties also noticed inconsistencies in voter registration forms submitted shortly before the Nov. 3, 2024, election. While county election offices processed the forms and found some legitimate registrations, a significant number were rejected because the information could not be verified as belonging to real people, the Attorney General’s Office said.

The Attorney General’s Office reviewed several thousand forms and interviewed people across the state and country in collaboration with officials from the Berks, Lancaster, and York counties. It also assisted with a similar prosecution by the Monroe County District Attorney’s Office.
“The Office of Attorney General determined that the crimes were not motivated by efforts to sway any election or voter rolls for any specific party or candidate. Rather, the charged defendants were motivated to maintain employment and income by reaching quotas,” the Attorney General’s Office release said. “The voter registration forms collected by Sainz’s operation included all party affiliations.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0679-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-10-24 14:57:19.695375
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 18:33:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Mimi Torres-García case prompts lawmakers to mull policy change,Ginny Monk and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/new-britain-girl-death-dcf-policy-changes/,Her case sparked debate about changes to the way DCF confirms children’s identities during interviews and whether it has enough resources.,"The case of an 11-year-old found dead earlier this month in a plastic storage container involves circumstances that the state Department of Children and Families has “rarely, if ever,” seen before, the interim commissioner said Thursday.
Those circumstances now have legislators talking about whether the agency has enough resources and considering potential changes to state law regarding the way DCF confirms children’s identities during interviews.
Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García was severely abused and starved. Her mother, aunt and her mother’s boyfriend have all been charged in connection to her death. DCF had a history with the family, and in January of this year responded to a report about maltreatment of Torres-García’s younger sister.
When DCF staff conducted their investigation, they were told that Torres-García was being homeschooled out of state and would return, although the date initially provided by the family to caseworkers for her return changed. DCF staff then had a video call with a child who Karla García, Torres-García’s mother, said was her daughter, DCF interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said. 
But court documents show that Torres-García died in September 2024, months before DCF staff had the video call with the girl who posed as her.
“The circumstances in this case outlined well-orchestrated efforts by adults, one rarely if ever seen before in our Agency, to conceal the whereabouts of a child by being intentionally deceptive and producing a completely different child to pose as the child in question,” Hamilton said in a statement.
Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that state agencies, including the Office of the Child Advocate, are working together with law enforcement to find out what happened.
“We’re doing everything we can, no stone unturned,”  he said. “I’m not sure it was dereliction. I think you had a parent, some family members, that tried to cover up a crime.”
The video call wasn’t standard practice, but the agency made an exception because the child was out of state and wasn’t the one who had reportedly experienced maltreatment, Hamilton said in her statement.
“They made an exception, and we have this terrible outcome,” said Children’s Committee ranking member Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton. “I don’t think that’s acceptable. We put policies and practices in place to keep people safe, and we follow them. Failure to do that is absolutely unacceptable.”
DCF policy is to conduct visits in-person, Hamilton said.
“We don’t have virtual visits with clients,” she said previously at a public meeting.
Asked Thursday about the well-being of the child who was made to pretend to be Torres-García, Lamont said he didn’t know, although it appeared he had been briefed on the details of the case.
“I don’t know the answer to that, except that that kid was looking pretty good in the video,” he said with a chuckle. A spokesperson from his office said the governor has not watched the video.
The agency recently implemented a policy change that requires staff to ask for photo identification of adults involved in investigations, and that policy will be formalized in policy books soon, Hamilton said.
“Through the engagement process with the parents or guardians, we interview all children in the household, relying on parental or guardian identification because children under the age of sixteen do not typically possess photo identification,” Hamilton said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, said she’s considering legislation for next session that would require DCF to maintain photos of all children involved in the system so they can be identified.
She said she’s also considering measures that would prevent anyone convicted of child abuse from moving into a home where children live after they have been released from prison on parole. In the Torres-García case, her aunt, Jackelyn García, had been convicted of risk of injury to a child and been incarcerated for 18 months. 
Jackelyn García appeared to be living with Torres-García’s family and has been charged in connection to her death.
“What are the policy pieces we can put in place to make sure that we are looking at things holistically to see not just immediate fixes, but a bigger picture?” Maher said.
DCF dealt with this case in the face of staff turnover challenges, an issue that exists at child welfare jurisdictions across the country. Online data shows that the agency has about 2,800 full-time employees, a drop from closer to 3,000 during the last gubernatorial administration.
“Social Work is a ‘calling’ and our staff are often immersed in some of the most complex forms of violence, child maltreatment, and family dynamics in our communities as part of their daily job functions and responsibilities,” Hamilton said in her statement. “As such, the work may result in extreme emotional, psychological and physical challenges for our employees.”
DCF has tried to improve turnover rates with internal office support, an Employee Assistance program that offers counseling, an Employee of the Month program, mentoring and training, among other initiatives.
At a recent conference in which DCF employees met to brainstorm strategies for improving challenges at the agency, Hamilton also spoke about the issue of worker turnover.
“We do pay. We do what we can to pay to attract people. The work is hard, no matter what. But we do have to, as a system, figure out ways to retain people. Because we’re putting a lot of effort, training and support in that first year,” Hamilton said. Although she didn’t have the numbers she said “people are deciding to leave after a year, and then you have to sort of start over.” 
At that conference, DCF employees also discussed the severity and complexity of their cases post-COVID pandemic. They said that the caseloads of workers is not the best metric for the amount of work they are doing, because the complexity of cases has risen significantly. 
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy and a former child advocate, said staff turnover has been “a dominant concern,” for DCF over the past few years.
She added that the conversation should be about DCF resources and whether there are enough services for families. Other systems, including Torres-García’s legal representation in her custody case, should be considered, she said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, said staff turnover and caseworker loads is something he’s having conversations about, although he didn’t disclose details of legislative proposals he’s considered.
“I am thinking of a number of things, of how we might be able to better position and enable DCF with more resources and with better oversight to better run their agency,” Paris said.
Paris wants to see more of the facts of the case before he makes decisions about legislative proposals, but there is a “history here with other cases that we can point to in terms of how we need to focus on procedural and policy changes.”
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said she’s also not ready to make decisions or advocate for legislation until she has all the facts, but that she thinks DCF has an “astronomical number” of staff.
“I think until we actually lay eyes on all of those reports, we’re not going to really be able to, I think, make any suggestions or kind of come up with any conclusions of where this all went and what went wrong,” Dauphinais said.
She added that she doesn’t want to see solutions that introduce too much government involvement in people’s lives.
“I don’t think anybody wants big government oversight over themselves merely because some individuals have created some horrific crimes, but we want to make sure that the agencies in place are doing their jobs correctly,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/90-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-24 14:57:19.695375

Pictured, from left, is Nic Few and Christian Kitchens (photo by Jon Gitchoff).“Man, don’t let them put you back in there.” 
Oshoosi Size is living with his older brother, Ogun, after being released from prison.
Ogun wants his little brother to get his life together and stay out of trouble. That’s not easy to do with a criminal record — even if you don’t do anything wrong.
The Brothers Size, running at the St. Louis Repertory Theater, is a funny, beautiful, painful play about young men trying to get by. It feels innovative and urgent, despite being written 20 years ago by Tarell Alvin McCraney, Academy Award-winning writer of Moonlight. It’s set in the Louisiana bayou, but all I could think about was Missouri.
Too little has changed for formerly incarcerated people since the play was written. There was a moment during the first Trump administration when Republicans, Democrats and faith leaders worked together on criminal justice reform. That moment ended without a true reckoning on mass incarceration in this country and its terrible ripple effects. 
Now, we’ve entered a “tough on crime” era where anything and anyone can be criminalized. Still, there are bipartisan, achievable steps that we can take to make things a little bit better at the state level.
Sandra Keely is the founder of 3 Daughters and 1,000 Sons, a St. Louis organization that runs free legal clinics and connects people with low-cost legal services to get their criminal records expunged. Keely also works on criminal justice reform in Missouri more broadly, inspired by her brother’s incarceration.
“When one person is in jail, the whole family is in jail,” she says.
Keely never went to law school, but she’s an expert in Missouri law. 
“Poverty has its benefits,” she told me of her self-acquired legal education. “Because I had poverty, I couldn’t afford an attorney. I looked for any way to glean information.”
Keely can tell you how to navigate the Missouri court system, specifically, how to represent yourself pro se (that is, without a lawyer). She can tell you how to handle a divorce or real estate issue pro se, but her focus is on criminal justice. Her organization is named for the fact that she’s the mother of three daughters, but also considers herself mother to thousands of men in the criminal justice system. She wants them to have a real chance at a new life when they get out.
Having a record of a conviction, or even an arrest that never led to charges, can keep a person  from finding work, housing or accessing food benefits. Those kinds of obstacles increase recidivism. If you can’t take care of yourself or your family, you’re more likely to commit further crimes, especially crimes of poverty.
Jerika White’s brother was convicted of multiple felonies as a teenager because he was in possession of a gun when his friend shoplifted. White is now the criminal justice policy manager at Empower Missouri, where she leads the campaign to pass Clean Slate legislation, which would automate the process for eligible individuals to have their records expunged. 
Clean Slate has had bipartisan bill sponsors and support. But it hasn’t made it across the finish line in the last several legislative sessions. It’s a pretty small ask — the bill doesn’t expand who is eligible for expungement, a group limited to those who have committed particular non-violent and non-sexual offenses, who have completed their sentences and not re-offended for a set number of years. 
It doesn’t help people whose records are on paper, rather than electronic. It doesn’t help people convicted of multiple felonies, though it’s typical to charge multiple felonies for one incident. 
What the bill would do is take what is already a right on paper in Missouri and make it a reality. There are over half a million Missourians who qualify for expungement under our current law, but only an estimated 1% of them succeed in having their records cleared. The petition process is complicated and lawyers are expensive.  
It makes more sense for the state to use the information it already possesses to automatically clear eligible records than to expect half a million people, many of them living in poverty, to hire lawyers in order to have the second chances they are entitled to under the law.
The only objections to the bill have involved concerns about administrability. This is a concern I take seriously given Missouri’s ongoing failure to administer public benefits in accordance with the law. But the bill that will be re-introduced this session allocates funding for technology upgrades and has generous implementation deadlines.
They teach you in criminal law 101 that there are four reasons we incarcerate people: incapacitation, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. We are currently taking people who aren’t dangerous and don’t need to be incapacitated, who have every reason to be deterred by their past excessive punishments, and we are making their rehabilitation impossible. 
The ball and chain that we force formerly incarcerated people who have served their time to carry is ongoing and unjustifiable retribution.
The Brothers Size is not a play about the law. It’s about the bond between siblings. But the plot turns on a brother’s assumption that his former felon brother will not be treated fairly. 
It’s a fair assumption. 
In Missouri, we can take a step towards letting people who have done their time truly have a chance to be free.

(Courtesy of Scott Lopez)With growing energy demands in New Mexico for developments ranging from housing to data centers, a new advocacy group posits nuclear power as a solution.
The New Mexico Nuclear Alliance, a registered trade industry group promoting nuclear power, will make its official debut Friday afternoon before lawmakers at an interim Science, Technology and Telecommunications committee meeting in Las Cruces.
Founder Scott Lopez started the New Mexico Nuclear Alliance in July. A former marine and longtime investor and business consultant, Lopez doesn’t have a background in nuclear power, but says he has “dozens of family members” from his hometown in Española either working or retired from nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Lopez told Source NM he was “driven to start the alliance” after moderating a panel discussion on nuclear power by officials from LANL; Urenco, the uranium processing facility; and Kairos Power, a start-up planning to construct a testing laboratory in Albuquerque, during last May’s two-day New Mexico Energy Policy Symposium.
“We realized there was no trade association, there was not the kind of voice, so to speak, to advocate for work on policy, economic development  for New Mexico’s nuclear industry, which is cradle-to-grave in the life cycle,” Lopez said.
He said the group’s vision is not “big stack Three-Mile Island or or Palo Verde type nuclear reactors,” but smaller reactors that are still in the testing or design process that he hopes will be “commercially viable and available” within a decade.
Lopez said the alliance has no plans to back legislation in the 2026 session. However, he said the group would consider supporting a bill similar to a Colorado law, HB25-1040, signed by Gov. Jared Polis in 2025, which redefines nuclear as a “clean energy resource” because it doesn’t release emissions that drive climate change.
Since the start of the year, the Trump administration has initiated plans to accelerate nuclear power production, and launched proposals to fasttrack new uranium mines in New Mexico, despite roadblocks from states; objections from tribal and environmental groups; and ongoing cleanup for abandoned mines.
Lopez said the New Mexico Nuclear Alliance supports new uranium mining, as long as there’s tribal consultation, but also funding for “funding, monitoring, and long-term reclamation,” from legacy mines. The Nuclear Alliance, he said, has a “moral obligation to acknowledge the legacy,” of uranium mining for nuclear power on New Mexico’s Pueblos and tribes.
“By cleaning up, doing right by our tribal communities that have uranium legacy issues is core to what the Nuclear Alliance believes in and will support,” Lopez said.

State officials say Amanda Nobles, the former administrator of Correctionville Specialty Care, accused the alleged rape victim of paying for sex before the woman was evicted from the home and dropped off at a homeless shelter with no notice and no medical records.
The nursing home employee who the resident accused of rape was the focus of sexual-impropriety complaints at two other Iowa care facilities. He was later convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor in a separate incident.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In July 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing Home Administrators charged Nobles with violating an unspecified state or federal regulation or law related to practice of the profession of nursing home administration. Recently, Nobles and the board agreed to resolve the disciplinary case with a settlement agreement and final order that doesn’t disclose the nature of any of the alleged violations.
The public order indicates only that while Nobles was working as the nursing home administrator at Dunlap Specialty Care from October 2022 to January 2023, and at Correctionville Specialty Care from August 2023 to November 2023, the facilities were cited for unspecified “deficiencies, some of which were attributable” to Nobles.
As part of the settlement agreement, the board has allowed Nobles to keep her license subject to two years of probation. She will also be required to complete 10 hours of educational training on ethics and nursing home administration.
The agreement notes that Nobles “does not admit to any wrongdoing but agrees to enter into this settlement agreement to avoid the cost and uncertainty of a contested case hearing.”
Alleged rape victim evicted from facility
State inspection records and court filings show that in November 2023, the Correctionville home was cited for an incident in which a female resident of the home alleged that a staff member, Martell Guider, sent her a video of himself masturbating and then sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex inside his car in the facility’s parking lot.
Guider was also accused of accepting money from the woman as payment for cigarettes he procured for her.

According to the inspectors’ written reports, the administrator of the home — which would have been Nobles, according to state inspectors and licensing board records — reported that after she saw evidence of the electronic payment from the resident to Guider, she “confronted” the resident and “accused” her of providing sexual favors to the employee in return for cigarettes — an allegation the resident denied.
According to the inspectors, the alleged victim of the sexual assault was “very upset by the allegations,” stating that she “would never do anything so vile.”
After the woman reported the alleged rape, Correctionville Specialty Care evicted the woman from the facility and dropped her off at a homeless shelter with no notice to the shelter and with no medical records, according to state inspectors.
Guider, a state-certified nursing assistant, was fired from the Correctionville home, but state inspectors say the facility’s parent company, Care Initiatives of West Des Moines, continued to provide work for him in other Iowa nursing homes that it operates.
Guider was never criminally charged in the Correctionville case. He was, however, criminally charged for his conduct while working at Kalona’s Pleasantview Home in 2024.
Allegations made at Audubon and Kalona homes
According to police and prosecutors, officials at Pleasantview Home confronted Guider sometime in January 2024 after multiple employees raised concerns that he was being inappropriate with a 17-year-old minor who was present at the home but not a resident.
Police allege that after his supervisors talked to him about the complaints, Guider shared an explicit photo of the minor with his employer. According to the police, Guider had threatened the minor to induce her to send him the photos via the social-messaging platform Snapchat.
Guider was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor by causing the minor to engage in a sex act, sexual exploitation through the use of photographs, possession of material depicting a minor engaged in sex, and first-degree harassment.
A jury convicted Guider of sexual exploitation by causing the minor to engage in a sex act. He was acquitted of the remaining charges and was sentenced to five years of probation.
In April 2023, prior to working at either the Correctionville or Kalona homes, Guider was working at Audubon’s Friendship Home when a female colleague filed a complaint with the state inspections department and police, alleging Guider had been making suggestive remarks to female coworkers, sent them photos of himself masturbating, had recorded video of one worker as she provided care for a resident, and had invited some of his female colleagues out to his car where he kept a bottle of Seagram’s Crown Royal.
Audubon police later acknowledged they didn’t pursue the matter, and the state inspections department acknowledged it rejected the complaint it had received, saying the situation was best addressed by management since it didn’t impact resident care.
Nobles has been an Iowa-licensed nursing home administrator for at least eight years. Some Board of Nursing Home Administrators records indicate she was granted her license in August 2009, while other board records give the date as March 2017.

Greenwood Leflore Hospital, plagued by financial hardship for years, saw a bright spot this spring when it was selected for a new federal payment status. But a dispute with Mississippi Medicaid could jeopardize the public Greenwood hospital’s ability to keep services open if a resolution is not reached, its leader says. 
“Access to services will be reduced for residents of the central Delta region,” Interim CEO Gary Marchand told Mississippi Today. He said no decisions about service changes have been made yet. 
The Mississippi Division of Medicaid informed the hospital in June it is recouping $5.5 million overpaid last year to Greenwood Leflore Hospital in state-directed payments, Marchand said. These amounts beef up low Medicaid reimbursements. The payments were high because they were calculated using old data, which did not take into account the hospital shuttering its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022. 
The amount is not insignificant. The hospital’s total operating expenses were $74.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year, according to an audit performed that year. 
Mississippi Medicaid has withheld $2 million so far this year and will continue recovering payments at a rate of $900,000 a quarter beginning in December, Marchand wrote in an Oct. 20 memo sent to hospital employees and board members. 
“Supplemental payments withheld to date along with the scheduled quarterly Recoupments will place a significant strain on hospital operations,” Marchand warned. 
Additionally, the hospital’s Medicaid tax assessments should have been lower to reflect the reduced service levels, which could have offset about half of the total recoupment, he added.
Greenwood Leflore Hospital proposed several options for repayment to the Division of Medicaid that would buy it time to first begin receiving higher payments for Medicare patients, said the memo. The anticipated larger payments are the result of the hospital’s acceptance to the federal Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program, which allows selected hospitals to be reimbursed based on their actual costs for inpatient care instead of a fixed amount. The higher payments are expected to begin by the end of the year and retroactively reimburse services provided since May 1. 
Next month, the hospital will begin providing skilled nursing care for people recovering after hospital stays, but will not begin receiving the higher payments for these services until late 2026. 
The Division of Medicaid advised the hospital in September that it did not agree with the solutions proposed by the hospital, Marchand said in the memo. On Oct. 9, the hospital appealed the decision and requested an administrative hearing on the matter, which has not yet been scheduled. 
The Division of Medicaid did not respond to a request for comment. 
Greenwood Leflore is one of 30 hospitals overpaid a total of $48 million during the state’s 2024 fiscal year, Marchand said.
Greenwood Mayor Kendrick Cox said he has been working with state and federal lawmakers to resolve the dispute. 
“We desperately need our hospital,” he said. “… There’s a lot of people in our community that aren’t financially able to transport themselves or their relatives to other towns or states for health care services.”  
The state-directed payments helped to stabilize Greenwood Leflore’s finances after it was forced to close valued services. But now, the closure of those services could put others at risk, and the new payment model hasn’t yet provided the relief it’s expected to. 
This is just one piece of what Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, called the “brutal mix of issues” that rural hospitals, which often have low patient volumes and high overhead costs, face when trying to break even.
“These are different environments than some of our larger, urban facilities,” he said.  
Rural hospitals across the U.S. are struggling. Over half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closure or have experienced losses on services, according to a recent report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform.  
Greenwood Leflore Hospital serves approximately 300,000 patients in the Mississippi Delta, a region of the state with limited access to medical care, according to its website. The 35-bed hospital operates a physician-staffed emergency room and offers general, vascular and outpatient orthopedic surgery, cancer care and a full suite of diagnostic services. 
The hospital has faced a litany of financial challenges over the past several years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the hospital was losing $7 to 9 million a year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The pandemic only worsened the hospital’s precarious financial condition. To keep its doors open, the hospital shut down departments and clinics, went up for lease multiple times, drew down millions of dollars in credit, applied for grants from the state Legislature, and pursued a more lucrative hospital designation. In 2023, the hospital suspended the use of 173 beds to control costs, according to an audit. 
Marchand, who will step down at the end of the year, repeatedly warned local leaders and state lawmakers that the hospital was on the verge of closure. 
To become more financially secure, the facility vied in 2023 to be designated a critical access hospital. These facilities are reimbursed by Medicare at a rate of 101%, theoretically allowing for a 1% profit. But its initial application was denied because critical access hospitals must be located 35 miles from the nearest hospital, and South Sunflower County Hospital in Indianola is closer, at 28 miles away. 
Greenwood Leflore was one of three hospitals in the state chosen for the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program in April. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson called the designation a “meaningful victory” in a statement.

“For far too long, rural hospitals have operated at a disadvantage, being underfunded, understaffed, and overburdened,” he wrote. “This program is a step toward leveling the playing field.” 
The program’s payment model can help stabilize rural hospitals, but it only increases reimbursements for inpatient care — even though many hospitals are seeing higher outpatient volumes, said Slabach.
And the reimbursement challenges rural hospitals face are worsened by workforce shortages, since rural hospitals often have to offer higher pay to attract providers — money they don’t have due to low reimbursement rates.
“It’s a vicious circle,” Slabach said. 
State-directed payments like those recouped from Greenwood Leflore Hospital, which were championed by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, have been a vital source of cash for Mississippi’s struggling rural hospitals, especially in a state that has gone a decade without expanding Medicaid.
But those payments are set to be reduced over time beginning in 2028 as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July. 
Mississippi is expected to receive at least $500 million over the next five years as a part of a major federal investment meant to offset the cuts’ impact on funding for rural health care. States must submit applications for the funding to the federal government by Nov. 5. 
The funding aims to strengthen access to health care by investing in lasting improvements to preventive medicine, collaboration between health care facilities, workforce development and innovations in care and technology.
“It could well be a lifeline for a lot of hospitals that are struggling,” said Harold Miller, the director of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
But the money is a one-time, lump sum of money, and there is no telling how states will choose to spend it or if it will go to struggling rural hospitals, he said.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Louisiana political leaders are preparing to use around $150 million monthly in state funding to help continue food assistance benefits while the federal government shutdown in Washington D.C. continues, Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said Friday. 

“I mean, it’s a choice between using money that we have or people going hungry,” Henry said in an interview. “That’s why we have the fund balances that we have.” 

Gov. Jeff Landry issued an executive order Friday helping the state to cover the costs of food assistance for most, but not all, of the people enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for a short period of time. Legislators also plan to approve an “urgent request” that will allow state money to be released for the program next week. 

Landry’s order is more restrictive than what Henry said lawmakers are willing to support. It only extends benefits to children, elderly and disabled people – but not other adults in the program – for a short period of time, from Nov. 1-4.  

The legislators want to preserve SNAP benefits for everyone who is already enrolled in the program for multiple months if necessary, according to the Senate President. 
In Louisiana, 793,000 people receive SNAP benefits that help them purchase food every month. Landry’s executive order only covers 565,000 of those people. 

Henry said it’s not clear yet whether the state will be able to find enough money in the short term to avoid a break in benefits for everyone who receives SNAP assistance, but that is the goal of the legislative leaders.
A priority is to ensure seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in the program – and receive their benefits on the first of the month before others – see no delay, he said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Louisiana will be paying for the food assistance to continue, even if the federal government doesn’t reimburse the state for its missed months of service. Henry said it could require the state to dip into its savings accounts, and he added Republicans and Democrats have agreed they are willing to do so. 

“We are sending a clear message that the people of Louisiana are the priority,” said Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus, agreeing with Henry. 

The House will vote on the urgent request Friday and the Senate will take it up on Wednesday, Henry said.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the disbarment Friday of a former Dodge County Attorney who was convicted of misusing his authority, three drunken offenses and found to have stalked the boyfriend of his estranged wife.
Oliver Glass, who resigned as Dodge County Attorney in 2021 after 10 years in office, had argued that the permanent loss of his license to practice law was excessive. Glass admitted that he had violated his oath of office and rules as a practicing attorney but sought a suspension of his license and the opportunity to practice law eventually.
But the Supreme Court, in its ruling, upheld the recommendation of the Counsel for Discipline that Glass lose his license.
The court pointed out that lawyers who are in public office are held to a higher standard than attorneys in private practice and that Glass had a third drunken driving offense in July 2024 while on probation for misusing his office.
His case generated several stories in the Omaha World-Herald, and his legal and drinking problems were detailed in the court’s order on Friday.
In 2018, his wife filed for a legal separation. Glass, upon learning that she was dating another man in 2020, looked up the boyfriend’s criminal record in a national database that is supposed to be used only for official law enforcement purposes.
Glass enlisted other attorneys in his office and local law enforcement personnel to also look up the boyfriend’s record. Glass also began surveilling the homes of the boyfriend and his estranged wife and sending threatening social media messages to the boyfriend.
In 2021, Glass resigned from office after a second DUI arrest, and his law license was suspended — a suspension that remained in effect into 2025. In addition, he was indicted by federal prosecutors for cyberstalking the ex-wife’s boyfriend.
He struck a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in federal court, which resulted in a 9 month prison term as well as supervised release. Prosecutors noted that the “weaponization of law enforcement and criminal investigations for personal benefit” by Glass had undermined “respect for the law.”
The Supreme Court, in a 13-page opinion, said the case generated negative publicity for the practice of law and “endangered public confidence in the legal profession and the justice system.”
The court agreed with a referee’s conclusion that there was a need to deter other attorneys from similar conduct and that a permanent disbarment was warranted.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 17:13:36+00:00,CT Mirror,State prosecutors investigating Bridgeport city councilman again,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/bridgeport-absentee-ballots-alfredo-castillo/,State officials are investigating a claim that Bridgeport city councilman Alfredo Castillo improperly collected absentee ballots this month.,"State officials are once again investigating Bridgeport city councilman Alfredo Castillo for allegedly collecting absentee ballots from public housing facilities ahead of the city’s general election next month. 
The State Elections Enforcement Commission voted this week to refer two recent complaints about Castillo to state prosecutors for potential criminal charges.
The complaints were filed by Jazmin Cooper, who is the daughter of Bridgeport city councilwoman Eneida Martinez, and they accused Castillo and three other political operatives of “manipulating voters” and illegally taking possession of absentee ballots, which is a felony in Connecticut. 
Cooper, who is deeply involved in Bridgeport’s politics, accused Castillo of taking possession of a voter’s absentee ballot at the Crescent Crossings housing complex, and she alleged that she personally witnessed Castillo stuff several absentee ballots into the front pocket of his hooded sweatshirt at the Harborview Towers, another public housing facility, on Oct. 11.
“I personally watched and recorded Alfredo stuff ballots in his sweater,” Cooper wrote. “He then disposed of them then came back at night to finish his job of [harvesting] ballots from voters.”
“He was going to units and sending them down to their mailbox to retrieve their ballots, had them sign and he did the rest,” Cooper wrote. 
Cooper also accused Castillo, who previously worked for Park City Communities, Bridgeport’s public housing authority, of using an old badge in order to gain access to the public housing facilities and its residents. 
“Alfredo Castillo has been using his housing authority HUD badge from years ago … and using it to impersonate a HUD worker,” one complaint said.
Cooper provided state officials with videos and photographs of Castillo outside the public housing facilities with a sweatshirt on, but the images don’t show Castillo handling ballots.
Castillo, who is already facing more than 30 criminal charges involving abuse of the state’s absentee ballot system during Bridgeport’s 2019 and 2023 elections, declined through his attorney to comment on the latest complaints.
Meanwhile, some of the other political operatives whom Cooper accused of assisting Castillo denied that they ever interacted with voters at the Crescent Crossings and Harborview Towers.
Tony Barr, who is the chairman of Bridgeport’s New Movement Party, said he did go to Harborview Towers, but he said it was to meet up with a friend.
And Wilfredo Martinez, the chairman of Bridgeport’s Independent Party, who is running for a city council seat, said he had never even been to the Crescent Crossings property.
“If they want to waste their time filing SEEC complaints, they can,” Martinez said. 
Ismael Sanchez, the fourth political operative named in the complaint, could not be reached for comment.
The new election complaints highlight the combative nature of Bridgeport’s municipal politics, even during off-year election years when there isn’t a citywide race for mayor.
This year’s general election in Bridgeport features several races for city council as well as a referendum on whether the city should change its charter to eliminate the local sheriff offices and allow the mayor to appoint the town and city clerk.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A heavy hitter in municipal financing has been tapped to help close the sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital.
The Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp., the quasi-public agency issuing the debt on behalf of buyer The Centurion Foundation, brought on Bank of America this week to co-manage the bond sale, according to Christopher Hunter, an agency spokesperson. The update was first reported by WPRI-TV 12.
Centurion, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, has struggled to lure investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to buy the pair of safety-net urban hospitals. Already, Rhode Island Attorney Peter Neronha, who reviewed the transaction under the state’s Hospital Conversations Act, has eased up on the conditions imposed on the deal four times to make it easier for Centurion to finalize its purchase. 
As the nation’s largest underwriter of municipal bonds, Bank of America was brought on to assist Barclay’s, the existing bond underwriter, to market the bonds to inventors, Hunter told the Rhode Island Current in a text message Thursday night. And, now the bond will move from a limited public offering to private placement, a move that further limits the investor pool but avoids more stringent federal registration and regulation requirements.
“A private placement will allow additional flexibility in marketing and selling the bonds to a group of highly specialized investors,” Hunter said.
Bank of America was one of eight companies that responded to the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp’s request for proposals seeking manager and co-manager for Centurion’s bond financing, according to Oct. 16, 2024 meeting minutes. Barclays, another respondent, was chosen as the senior manager for the bond issue at the same meeting, while an option for a co-manager was deferred, with the agency’s executive director empowered to make a decision. 
Hunter said Friday that identities of the other companies that submitted proposals could not be shared without a formal public records request. Rhode Island Current submitted the records request Friday morning.
Executive Director Dylan Zelazo told the board at its meeting on Thursday that he had brought on Bank of America to serve as co-senior managing underwriter for the bonds. There was no discussion of the decision, Hunter said. A recording of the meeting was not immediately available.
A spokesperson for Bank of America’s Global Markets segment, which oversees municipal banking and investments, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment.
The bonds were previously scheduled to close by Oct. 31, after multiple delays and changes to the terms of the transaction. Now, that deadline has been pushed back, although a new date has not been set, Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s Rhode Island subsidiary, said in an email Friday morning.
“Centurion’s commitment to complete the sale has not changed,” Brown said.
Nor have the underlying financial and economic factors that are making it difficult to sell the bonds in the first place.
S&P Global Ratings Agency noted “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s bonds in a March 25 ratings assessment, giving the bonds a BB- rating which denotes relatively high-risk for a non-investment grade bond. The rating was affirmed by S&P in August.
The unfavorable credit assessment largely reflects the status of the hospitals’ current owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. The LA-based hospital chain operator’s mismanagement of its hospitals is well-documented, largely attributed to former majority stakeholder Leonard Green, a private equity that drained the accounts of health care facilities nationwide to pay out investors and executives, according to a U.S. Senate Budget Committee report in January. 
Roger Williams and Fatima remain on the brink, posting a $60 million operating loss for fiscal 2023 with projections for multimillion-dollar losses in fiscal 2024, alongside staffing and equipment shortages and safety problems posed by overdue infrastructure repairs. 
And the bleak financial forecast doesn’t account for federal spending cuts, which are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks.
Yet proponents of the sale insist Centurion is the only hope for keeping the critical health care services from closing — an outcome that would add even more strain to the state’s fragile health care landscape.
The two hospitals in Providence and North Providence, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide, and employ 2,700 people.
“The Attorney General understands that Centurion continues to work to close the deal, but believes that it must happen very soon to ensure that the plan endorsed by the bankruptcy court is not upended,” Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an emailed response Friday.
The return to nonprofit status under Centurion could let hospitals recoup donations given to a charitable foundation formerly tied to the facilities. Earlier this month, CharterCARE Health asked the similarly named, but distinct, Chartercare Foundation for a “return” of donations that were intended to support the hospitals. The two entities were initially linked, but separated in 2014 when Prospect bought the hospitals, shifting them from nonprofits to for-profit entities no longer able to accept tax-exempt charitable foundations. 
Paula Iacono, the executive director for Chartercare Foundation, said previously that the foundation’s board of directors would consider the request at an unscheduled time. Iacono did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

Connecticut relies entirely on imported natural gas because the state has no natural gas reserves or production. 
Connecticut’s electric power sector alone used a record amount of natural gas in 2023, accounting for nearly 60% of total state generation.
Nearly all natural gas consumed in Connecticut comes from out-of-state sources, primarily the Appalachian region, including Pennsylvania, as well as the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and the Mid-Continent region. The gas enters the state through three main interstate pipeline systems: Algonquin, Iroquois, and Tennessee, with almost all supplies passing through New York before reaching Connecticut. 
Local utilities, including Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas, and Eversource, distribute the fuel to homes, businesses, and power plants via over 60 city gate stations. The state also lacks underground storage, relying on nearby states to meet peak winter demand, making imported natural gas critical for Connecticut’s energy needs.

Gretchen Whitmer in the Michigan Court of Claims to argue for the unconstitutionality of a so-called “Pregnancy Exclusion” in state law that determines a person’s right to choose their end-of-life care. 
The lawsuit specifically concerns the Michigan Estates and Protected Individuals Code, which dictates the process for designating a patient advocate, who can determine a person’s medical care if they are not able to do so themselves. However, pregnancy creates an exception to this. 
“A patient advocate cannot make a medical treatment decision under [state law] to withhold or withdraw treatment from a pregnant patient that would result in the pregnant patient’s death,” the statute reads. 
Filed on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the statute is a violation of due process rights and of equal protection for pregnant people, as well as freedom of speech rights. 
The lawsuit, filed by Compassion Legal: The End-of-Life Justice Center at Compassion & Choices; If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice; Perkins Coie LLP; and Mogill & Lemanski, PLLC, also argues that this goes against Michigan’s constitutional protections for reproductive freedom, which includes “the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy.”
“Denying individuals the right to refuse treatment because they are pregnant is fundamentally at odds with the Michigan Constitution,” said Jess Pezley, senior staff attorney at Compassion Legal, in a press release. 
Stacey LaRouche, a press secretary for Whitmer, wrote to the Advance in response to the suit, “Governor Whitmer has been a champion for reproductive freedom, and led the fight to protect and expand our rights following the repeal of Roe v. Wade, when other states did nothing. We cannot comment on pending litigation, but will be following this closely.”
Dr. Viktoria Koskenoja, an Emergency Medicine Physician in Skandia, Mich., and her husband, Sam Holcomb, are both plaintiffs in the case. Koskenoja designated Holcomb as her patient advocate, should she ever not be capable of making her own medical decisions — and included directions around potential pregnancy in her guidance to him. 
“I made the decision to include them anyway because I felt so strongly that my ability to control my own medical care shouldn’t depend on my pregnancy status,” she said in the press release, despite her lawyer encouraging her not to. 
“When I agreed to become my wife’s patient advocate, I made a commitment to speak for her if she could not speak for herself, and honor her most personal decisions,” Holcomb added.
The lawsuit has been assigned to Michigan Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel, who earlier this year struck down Michigan’s mandatory 24-hour waiting period for receiving abortions.

That hearing is set to start Nov. 4.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to those charges, which accuse him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Detention challengedAbrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation cast a spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. Abrego Garcia has stated he is willing to be deported to Costa Rica, which has agreed to accept the longtime Maryland man as a refugee. Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution. The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa —  Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis found little evidence the Trump administration has made any effort to remove Abrego Garcia either to the southern African nation of Eswatini or Costa Rica. At that hearing, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys told Xinis they have not received an answer from the federal government as to why officials won’t remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica. Detained in PennsylvaniaXinis is currently mulling whether or not to order the release of Abrego Garcia, who is detained at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania. Any indefinite stay would likely be unconstitutional, per a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.In March, Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, where he detailed his experience of psychological and physical torture.",,,,2025-10-24 12:17:05.335891

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-24 15:49:26+00:00,Mississippi Today,School choice debate: Should private schools have to meet state standards if they take public money?,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/24/school-choice-debate-should-private-schools-have-to-meet-state-standards-if-they-take-public-money/,A popular argument among school-choice opponents is that voucher programs would allow private schools in Mississippi to accept tax dollars without being held to the same standards as public schools.,"The latest meeting of the House committee studying school choice opened with a bold statement: Private schools could be convinced to support “school choice” and take public dollars — as long as there are no strings attached. 
The hours-long hearing Thursday marked the third meeting for a group of representatives tasked with studying school choice. This refers to a number of policies that provide families more options, in and outside of the public schools system, including using public tax dollars for private schools. State legislative leaders, including House Speaker Jason White, have said expanding school choice will be a top issue in the coming legislative session.

The first speaker, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, said repeatedly at the meeting that private schools would not make their students take state assessments, nor would they change their faith-based curriculum or their ability to turn some students away, even if the schools were to take state money through school-choice programs. 
It’s a popular argument among school-choice opponents — that voucher programs would allow private schools to accept tax dollars without being held to the same standards as public schools. But Donahoe did little to rebut it, instead doubling down on his stance.  
When Rep. Greg Holloway, a Democrat from Hazlehurst, questioned his logic, Donohoe replied, “I don’t think we have to compromise anything. I think our schools do a good job.” 
READ MORE: Lawmakers want to expand ‘school choice’ in Mississippi. Here’s what it looks like in neighboring states
Many lawmakers were curious about accountability standards for private schools. Donahoe said that, mostly, private schools are held accountable by parents who pay tuition, typically between $7,200 and $7,500 a year. 
Other representatives were less skeptical about private-school accountability.
“I don’t want to force our Christian schools to teach secular curriculum,” said Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville and co-chair of the select committee, after the meeting. ”I don’t want the state’s involvement to infringe on that in any way.”
Owen and Donahoe suggested that private schools serve many low-income students, but data says otherwise. In 2016, just 8% of private school students lived in poor households, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Donahoe predicted that if school choice laws are passed, private schools wouldn’t get an influx of students, calling it a “false narrative” perpetuated by opponents of the choice policies.  
It’s true that in other states, a majority of school-choice vouchers went to children who were already enrolled in private school, and school-choice programs don’t necessarily make private schools more accessible for low-income students or students with disabilities. 
Next, officials from the Mississippi High School Athletics and Activities Association told lawmakers that expanded school-choice policies would “completely upset” the competitive balance of high school sports and activities. 
“There’s no doubt in my mind we’re going to have movement based on academic needs, but I promise that the vast majority of our movement will be because of athletics,” said Chad Harrison, president of the association. 
He encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing MHSAA to maintain its eligibility rules for students. That means if a student living in one district transfers into another district, they wouldn’t immediately be eligible to play sports. 
Owen said the association’s concerns were addressed in a bill that failed last session, and they’d likely be able to find a compromise this year. 
Mary Werner, a Mississippi Board of Education member, and Sam Duell from yes. every kid., a pro-school choice advocacy organization funded by the Koch brothers, concluded the meeting. 
Werner, who said she wasn’t speaking to the committee on behalf of the board, suggested establishing a lottery would be the most equitable school-choice solution. 
Duell presented a number of polls and surveys that showed parent satisfaction is higher when they get to make choices about their child’s education.
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, a Republican from Starkville, said the select committee on school choice would likely meet again once or twice before the legislative session begins in January.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23165817/Education-Freedom-Select-Committee-1.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:59:39.338975

Kansas officials have refused to turn over the data because of concerns it would be a privacy violation. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A California judge said states suing the federal government over demands for food program data are likely to win their claims and ruled program funding must continue while the case progresses. 
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Families Secretary Laura Howard have been criticized and sued by state Republican leaders for refusing to turn over Supplemental and Nutrition Assistance Program data, potentially causing the USDA to withhold $10 million in administrative costs. The state has appealed that decision.
Although Kansas didn’t join the national lawsuit, state leaders are watching the outcome, as it may support their reasons for refusing to yield to USDA demands. 
A spokeswoman for the governor’s office said it wouldn’t comment about ongoing litigation.  
In a 25-page order filed last week, U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney considered the arguments of 21 states and the District of Columbia that have signed onto the lawsuit. 
The national case was filed in the Northern District of California in July, outlining why states believe the federal request for personal data of SNAP recipients and applicants violates privacy rules. 
Plaintiff states are likely to establish that they are not required by SNAP Act provisions to provide data and “consequently, have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that USDA, in demanding such data, acted in a manner contrary to law,” Chesney wrote.
To determine her ruling on the injunction, Chesney considered multiple factors, including whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed based on case merits and whether they are likely to suffer irreparable harm.  
Howard told Kansas Reflector the state is concerned that turning over private data before the California lawsuit is settled could put the state at risk. 
“I honestly believe that if I were to release that data, then the courts find in favor of the states, then I’m putting the state at liability for releasing the personal information of more than 700,000 Kansans,” she said. 
At least 27 Republican-led states have turned over the data requested, according to NPR, while most the states resisting the USDA demands are led by Democrats.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Laura-Howard-20250820_135927-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:59:39.338975

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic recently charged licensee Ryan Bowman with violating the provisions of the Iowa law dealing with chiropractors’ health care agreements with patients.
The charges state that Bowman “specifically” violated Chapter 135N.1(2) of the Code of Iowa, which outlines more than a dozen different requirements for such agreements. The board has not publicly disclosed which of those requirements it feels Bowman failed to meet.

In its final order sanctioning Bowman, the board also says its “investigation revealed concerns about proper licensure” of Bowman’s staff, but the order does not identify those concerns or the staff.
To resolve the case, Bowman and the board have agreed to a settlement that requires Bowman to comply with the law, complete six hours of educational training on documentation, and, within three months, provide a copy of his chiropractic assistant’s certification.
According to state records, the board action stems from a patient complaint that was received in May 2024.
Bowman did not respond to calls to his clinic Thursday.

Susan Collins, joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders at a Labor Day rally in Portland, Maine on Sept. 1, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)A second Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Maine dropped out of the race to endorse Gov. Janet Mills — but this time because of controversial past remarks from popular political newcomer Graham Platner. 
Daira Smith-Rodriguez, a union member and U.S. Air Force civilian contracting officer, announced Friday that she ended her bid. 
“As a survivor of military sexual assault, I cannot, in good conscience, indicate support or remain silent if there is even a possibility that someone who questions the reality of this crisis could be elevated to the United States Senate,” Smith-Rodriguez wrote in a statement on her website.
In Reddit posts from 2013, Platner downplayed the challenges service members face in reporting sexual assault and suggested people wouldn’t get raped if they weren’t inebriated around people they didn’t feel comfortable with, as the Washington Post first reported.
In one post, Platner wrote, “In today’s current climate, when every whisper of a misplaced hand brings down a feature length film, anyone who actually thinks the military is purposefully covering up rape to save the career of some god damn [captain], is clearly both an idiot and junior enough in rank or life experience to think it matters.”
Platner has disavowed the comments, telling The Post, “I don’t want people to judge me off the dumbest thing I said on the internet 12 years ago.”
Unearthed Reddit comments present first stumble in Platner’s rise

But given these past remarks, Smith-Rodriguez said that Platner’s candidacy poses “too great a risk to those who still need a voice to fight for them” and for that reason she’ll be backing Mills, who she said has a record of “courage, conviction, and an unrelenting drive to deliver results for all Mainers.” 
Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, also suspended his campaign shortly after Mills entered the race earlier this month and subsequently endorsed her.
With the June 2026 primary still months away, it’s to be seen whether Mainers agree, though the first public polling on the Senate race shows apparent continued support for Platner over Mills. 
The survey captured responses while some of Platner’s past comments were being made public, but more controversies have surfaced since, including his now-covered Nazi-linked tattoo. 
Smith-Rodriguez’s exit from the race comes days after another Democratic Senate candidate Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide, called for Platner to drop out because of revelations about his past. 
In an interview with Maine Morning Star on Friday, Wood — the only gay candidate in the Senate race — doubled down on that call in light of additional comments reported by The Advocate on Wednesday that revealed Platner had a pattern of homophobic language and rhetoric that mocked or demeaned LGBTQ+ people in more recent Reddit posts, between 2016 and 2021. 
“Today I find that stuff abhorrent,” Platner told The Advocate. “And I am sorry that I ever used it.”
Wood said he finds how recent and prolonged these comments were to be alarming and questions how voters can trust that Platner is telling the truth today. 
Wood also worries about such remarks giving license to use homophobic language or symbols that indicate violence, which he said “is something that Donald Trump has really eroded for our country.” In Wood’s view, the worst thing the Democratic Party can do “in the opposition to Donald Trump is somehow give permission to looking lightly on what I believe are both offensive and threatening symbols and words.”
Where Smith-Rodriguez and Wood diverge is on whether a crowded primary will be beneficial as Democrats try to unseat long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
“It has become clear that Republicans are eager to see a crowded Democratic primary that divides our voices and strengthens theirs,” Smith-Rodriguez wrote Friday in her statement ending her candidacy. “I will not allow that to happen.”
Wood, who is staying in the race, said he consistently hears from Mainers at town halls that they want a primary process that affords them the opportunity to weigh in on who the best Democratic candidate is to put up against Collins. 
“Keep in mind that we have ranked-choice voting,” Wood added, which will allow Mainers to rank candidates in order of preference rather than choosing just one. “So Daira’s comments about exiting the race, I view it less of a problem because of how ranked-choice plays out.”

The governorship and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]Early in-person voting in New Jersey’s gubernatorial and Assembly elections begins Saturday.
New Jersey’s 21 counties will stand up 173 polling stations where voters can cast machine ballots ahead of Election Day. They are open between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., or 6 p.m. on Sundays.
The state’s early-voting period runs through Nov. 2. Voters can cast ballots at any early polling station in their home county.
New Jersey’s leading gubernatorial candidates, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R), are set to be busy this weekend.
Ciattarelli is holding a bevy of early voting rallies in North Jersey, including one in Clifton where he will be joined by Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González Colón. He is also hosting a tele-rally Friday night with President Donald Trump.
Sherrill is doing much the same, though with a focus on turnout in Camden and Middlesex counties. She will get a boost from some other prominent Democratic officials. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will stump for her at a rally in Monroe Saturday, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly will join her at a Blackwood rally later that day.
All 80 Assembly seats are also on the ballot this year.
See a list of early voting centers
Nearly 1.2 million residents cast early in-person ballots in last year’s general election, smashing turnout records and pulling past mail-voting turnout that had, until then, accounted for an overwhelming share of New Jersey’s pre-Election Day voting.
New Jersey law requires the state to reimburse counties for early voting expenses for up to five, seven, or 10 early polling sites, depending on a county’s number of registered voters, and counties are required to set up at least three, five, or seven sites, depending on their size.
Three counties — Hudson, Essex, and Union — have opted to erect more early polling stations than will be reimbursed by the state this year. Essex and Union counties will each have 11 early polling stations, while Hudson will have 34.
The 173 early polling stations set a new record for the state. Last year, counties had a total of 168 early voting sites.

The national movement is aimed at safely disposing of medicines that, in the wrong hands, could be dangerous. In April, during the last campaign, Kentucky collected 9,843 pounds of unused prescription drugs, according to Gov. Andy Beshear’s office. 
“Safely disposing of prescription drugs means we can create safe spaces for those in recovery,” Van Ingram, the executive director of the Office of Drug Control Policy, said in a statement. “Only together can we keep reducing overdose deaths and support treatment resources, and National Prescription Drug Take Back Day can be the first step for so many. If you or a loved one need help now, know there are resources out there for you to get help today.”
People who cannot make it to a drop-off location Saturday can do so year-round at Kentucky’s 200 permanent drug disposal locations in 87 counties. 
“One life lost to a drug overdose is one too many, and we have to do everything in our power to keep our loved ones safe and get them into recovery,” Beshear said in a statement. “National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is just one way we can make sure drugs are disposed of properly and prevent drug abuse, and I encourage every single Kentuckian with out-of-date or unused prescription drugs to take part.”

‘Use caution, no matter what’ 
Putting drug paraphernalia and nonprescription drugs in the hands of researchers can also reveal public health risks, a recent announcement showed.  
New testing of discarded syringes in Fayette County revealed substances that warrant community caution, the University of Kentucky’s Harm Reduction Hub and Lexington recovery organization Voices of Hope announced this month. 
Jimmy Chadwell, the president of Voices of Hope, said these substances aren’t new to Kentucky but they are new to Fayette County. And while the discovery is not necessarily an emergency, there are always risks involved when people are in active-use addiction, he said. 
“I think that people should always use caution, no matter what,” Chadwell said. 
The University of Kentucky’s Harm Reduction Hub recently started testing syringes from various communities, Chadwell said, to see how many different chemicals are in them. Any concerning results are then shared with the county where those syringes came from, he said. 
Chadwell did not have the specific location the recent batch — the largest tested yet — came from, but did say they were all from people who inject drugs in Fayette County. He also did not know how many syringes were tested. 
The substances found in a large batch of recently-tested used syringes from Fayette County include carfentanil, xylazine, medetomidine and BTMPS (a plasticizer) — which are linked to overdoses, severe wounds and medical complications, according to Voices of Hope. 
According to the organization: 

Carfentanil is an extremely potent fentanyl analog that may not always be detected by fentanyl test strips, greatly increasing overdose risk. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, carfentanil is “10,000 times more potent than morphine.” 
Xylazine is a veterinary sedative associated with severe skin wounds and tissue damage.
Medetomidine is a veterinary tranquilizer similar to xylazine, linked to rapid-onset
withdrawal symptoms requiring medical care.
BTMPS is a plasticizer used in the manufacture of plastics, which in animal studies has been associated with heart and lung damage and sudden death.

Kentuckians should take a few precautions, Chadwell said, to keep themselves and others safe. They include:

Never use alone. 
Always have Narcan available, which is available for free at a variety of places across Kentucky. 
Learn how to provide rescue breathing. 
Several organizations, including Voices of Hope, also provide free fentanyl test strips. Voices of Hope, located at 644 North Broadway in Lexington, also has  xylazine test strips and is working to get medetomidine test strips, Chadwell said.  

Chadwell compared Narcan to a “fire extinguisher.” 
“We don’t have a fire extinguisher in our office in hopes that a fire breaks out, but we have one just in case it breaks out,” he said. “It doesn’t mean I’m going to go start a fire and then put it out if I have a fire extinguisher. Same concept with Narcan. Even if you’re someone that’s never used drugs, you don’t even know anyone that used drugs, you can be an innocent bystander and see someone overdosing and have that and be able to respond.” 
Anyone needing recovery support in the Lexington area can reach out to Voices of Hope, Chadwell said. Call 859-303-7671, email info@voicesofhopelex.org, visit 644 N. Broadway or go to the website at www.voicesofhopelex.org. 
“We want to get the education out there,” Chadwell said. “It’s not necessarily that it’s so much more dangerous than it was a few weeks ago. It’s just another reminder there are new substances — and new substances we haven’t detected yet can also come around. If they do, we’ll be sure to let the public know.”

(Screenshot: FDA)A UNC researcher says the United States has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to informing consumers about the potential health risks of products they’re buying. 
Depictions of smoking-related health problems, including images of rotting teeth and tumors, are printed on cigarette packs sold in Canada. And inside, explicit health warnings are printed on each cigarette. 
Food product labels in most Latin American countries are on the front of packages and say whether they are high in salt, sugar or saturated fat. 
The U.S. is behind other countries in requiring easy to understand nutrition and warning labels that draw consumers’ attention, said Marissa Hall, a UNC-Chapel Hill behavioral scientist. 
“Warning labels are a surprisingly powerful tool for changing behavior when they are well-designed,” Hall said Thursday. Labels with icons or graphics are the most effective, she said. 
Hall gave a talk about useful labels on alcohol, tobacco and food as one of the recipients of a campus award recognizing achievements of junior faculty. 
As it happens, the United States is in the midst of a long process of updating its rules for tobacco labels to include graphic images and health warnings on packages and cartons of cigarettes. Tobacco companies have sued to stop the federal Food and Drug Administration rule, and litigation is ongoing. 
Studies have found that graphic cigarette package warnings help people quit smoking, she said. Other studies have found that graphic tobacco labels could avert thousands of deaths in the US over time. 
The FDA has also proposed a rule that would require packaged foods to have nutrition labels printed on the front, with information whether salt, sugar and saturated fat content is low, medium or high. 
Labels are important because they deliver information to consumers right when they need it, Hall said. It’s also important to get the labeling right, because weak labels are hard to change. 
Hall and a colleague created UNC Mini Mart, a research space that looks like a convenience store. One UNC Mini Mart study found parents were less likely to purchase sugary drinks for their children when the bottles had pictorial warnings about heart damage and type-2 diabetes.
Marissa Hall, behavioral scientist at UNC Chapel Hill, Oct. 23, 2025 (Photo: Screenshot)
Hall also said the U.S.’s required warning label on alcohol hasn’t changed since 1989, leaving plenty of opportunities for upgrades. 
Alcohol warning labels don’t follow best practices, she said. They’re on the back or side of the package, they’re long, hard to read messages with no images or icons. 
In a recent study that’s under review, researchers found that fewer than one-third of people who drink alcohol said they read the warning in the previous three months, Hall said. Only 4% were able to remember all five topics in the warning. 
Researchers are in the middle of a study where people bring their own alcohol containers to the study office to have more prominent labels attached to the front. People in the control group will have a barcode attached. 
“Ultimately, this will provide some of the strongest evidence of whether or not these new evidence-based warning labels would reduce drinking,” she said. 
In an interview, Hall said it’s a step forward for the FDA to require nutrition labels on the front of packaged foods, but the label design is not ideal. 
There’s evidence that people struggle to interpret numbers, she said. The proposed labeling would not include icons, images, or anything that conveys a warning. 
“It’s a missed opportunity to signal something in a different way,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-23-at-10.19.38-PM-1024x251.png,,,2025-10-24 11:22:53.346796

Changes to the program, made under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, take effect Nov. 1. Signed into law in July, the act cuts $168 billion of federal funding for SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, over the next decade. 
A recent report from DataHaven found that thousands of Connecticut residents will entirely lose coverage or see major monthly reductions in SNAP benefits.
[SNAP benefits poised to stop Nov. 1 despite CT hopes to continue]
Overall, Connecticut residents will receive $11 million to $15 million less in food assistance each month.
In Connecticut, Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport will be hit the hardest, with thousands of SNAP recipients in each city losing at least $25 a month in benefits (both the Urban Institute and DataHaven used this threshold to focus only on families receiving substantial benefits).
Hartford is projected to receive between $1.2 million and $1.6 million less in SNAP benefits each month. New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport could see between $900,000 and $1.2 to $1.3 million less a month.
About 11% of Connecticut residents live below the federal poverty line but account for 41% of all SNAP recipients, according to DataHaven.
Before the new rules, adults without disabilities or without young dependents had to either work 80 hours a month or meet an exemption in order to receive SNAP benefits. The bill expands work requirements and removes numerous exemptions including ones for veterans, people aged 55 to 64, young adults 18 to 25 who aged out of foster care, homeless people and parents of children 14 to 17.
Additionally, noncitizen lawful immigrant groups such as asylum seekers and refugees will no longer qualify for SNAP benefits.
According to the Urban Institute, evidence shows that work requirements decrease SNAP benefits but don’t increase work or wages.
“People in every corner of our state are being crushed by the cost of living, and as this data shows, federal SNAP changes are only going to make that worse,” Meghan Holden, the director of marketing and communications for The Connecticut Project Action Fund said in an Oct. 20 DataHaven media advisory. “Right now, 58,000 Connecticut households are at risk of losing an average of $194 per month in SNAP benefits. That money is the difference between a child going to bed with an empty belly or full, between a veteran eating one meal a day or three, between hunger and survival.”
[Which CT social services could the government shutdown affect?]
Changes to the program also include stricter cost-of-living adjustments to the Thrifty Food Plan, which determines the cost of a nutritious and balanced meal. The plan serves as the basis for the maximum amount of money put into SNAP, but under the changes, reevaluation for the costs of a meal will be less frequent and cost-neutral, or will only take into account inflation.
Historically, SNAP benefits have not fully covered a “modestly-priced meal” as determined by the TFP, according to data from the Urban Institute. The DataHaven report found that major cost disparities exist between modestly-priced meals and the maximum SNAP benefits currently distributed in Connecticut, especially in the Western Connecticut Planning Region. 
If the federal shutdown continues into next month, SNAP benefits will not be sent out.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.32.13-PM-1024x775.png,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The first legal challenge to North Carolina’s new congressional district lines came quickly. 
One day after the legislature approved a plan to change the 1st Congressional District from purple to red, voters have already told federal judges they want to contest it. 
The 1st District is already part of an unresolved lawsuit over racial gerrymandering. Some of the voters who brought that suit have asked the court to add the plan for the new district to it. 
The new district lines adopted this week dismantle a bloc of Black voters that has helped send a Black Democrat to Congress since 1992. 
North Carolina Republicans who redrew the lines this week said they were answering a call from President Donald Trump to increase GOP membership in the US House in next year’s election. Republicans have a thin majority in the House and could face losing it in the midterm election. 
The redrawn map would change the state’s congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and four Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. The Triangle and Charlotte would have the remaining Democratic districts. 
Republicans maintained they did not use racial data in redrawing the 1st District, but the amended complaint filed Thursday in the ongoing lawsuit said the new district violates the federal Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. 
The district as it was drawn for last year’s election is part of a federal lawsuit covering congressional and state Senate districts. It’s this lawsuit the voters want to update with a challenge to the new district. 
A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case this summer but has not issued a ruling. 
On Wednesday, the judges ordered lawyers to file briefs by Monday addressing what the new district lines mean for the existing case. 
Republican legislative leaders did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new challenge.
The 1st District has played an outsized role in the state’s civil rights history, the amended court complaint says. The district has elected a Black representative since 1992, when Eva Clayton became the first Black candidate since 1898 to win a U.S. House seat from North Carolina. US Rep. Don Davis narrowly won reelection to a second term in 2024. 
The new district boundaries dilute Black voting power in both the 1st District and the 3rd District, the complaint says, making it unlikely that Black residents will be able to elect the candidate of their choice in either of them. 
“Whatever the General Assembly’s partisan aims, they have—once again—chosen to target Black neighborhoods and communities to achieve them,” the complaint says. 
Also on Thursday, lawyers with the nonprofit group Forward Justice said they plan to sue over the new district, but they have not yet filed that suit.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4810-scaled-e1761277055148-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Getty Images)Georgia’s SNAP administrators say they would need more than $60 million from state coffers to maintain their level of staffing after next year’s federal cuts to the program that more than one in 10 Georgians use for groceries.
The news from the agency that oversees the food stamp program comes after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp ordered state agencies not to ask for more money for their budgets. It also illustrates the difficulty that state agencies are facing with disruptions in federal funding.
The funding need was flagged in a form that the Department of Human Services sent to the governor’s budget office. The agency also informed its board of the funding need in September.


Shutdown means no aid in Georgia
SNAP recipients face a threat closer than next year: Georgia won’t send out November SNAP benefits unless the federal government reopens. Asked about contingency plans, Kemp’s office blamed minority-party Democrats for the federal shutdown. Georgia SNAP administrators say they have asked the state’s payment vendor for a plan on how quickly they can issue benefits once the shutdown ends.


Yet in compliance with Kemp’s budget instructions, the DHS did not make a formal request for more money in its full, formal budget request to the governor’s office.
Agency spokesperson Ellen Brown told The Current in an e-mail that “We continue to work closely with (The Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget) to determine any needs that may fall outside the parameters of the overall budget instructions.”
The governor’s office did not respond to written questions about whether he will consider the funding boost needed for the SNAP program, or his considerations as his office prepares spending plans. “The budget development process is still ongoing and our full recommendation will be released at a later time,” a spokesman wrote.
Kemp’s spending recommendations are expected in early January and his staff are already working on spending plans that will cover Oct. 1, 2026, when SNAP cuts passed in the Republican federal spending and tax law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts go into effect.
Georgia Budget and Policy Institute graphic
The cuts will decrease funding for state staff salaries who administer the food stamp programs from 75% to half. The amount necessary to fill that gap is about $62 million per year, according to early projections by DHS.
The new federal budget guidelines have rewritten multiple rules and procedures in the SNAP program. States must implement work requirement rules by Nov. 1 for working-age able-bodied people without dependents. Georgia also must pay a greater share of the salaries for staff working to upgrade the software system which determines eligibility for residents in the state. New rules mean that the federal government may withhold some federal funding from states that make too many payment errors in their SNAP programs.
Sen. Ben Watson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Savannah state Senator Ben Watson, a Republican, will oversee the discussions about the SNAP program as the chair of the budgeting subcommittee that oversees the Georgia Department of Human Services.
In an interview with The Current GA, Watson said it’s a long time until the legislative session starts and the situation is fluid in Washington, D.C.
He said the federal government may yet look at things like the definition of the federal poverty level or at tax credits for low-income households.
Watson said the state will look at whether Georgia’s SNAP program might be “tightened up.”
“So will Georgia be a leader in this and see if we can make some exciting change? We’ll see,” Watson said.
All Democrats in Congress and a few Republicans voted against the federal tax and spending law passed last summer. Georgia’s delegation split on party lines.
The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, notes that small towns and rural areas such as McIntosh County, tend to have higher SNAP utilization than the state average, and that their residents have the most to lose if Georgia decreases funding or changes eligibility to make it harder to get into the program.
States are still trying to assess all the impacts of the federal funding cuts, and are awaiting federal guidance from Washington, D.C. about how the changes will affect social safety net programs and state administration of those programs.
Much of any upheaval in the budget cuts will be faced by the new Georgia governor who will be elected next November. Kemp, who is limited to two terms in office, will be stepping down in January 2027.
Brown, the DHS spokeswoman, said that her agency remains committed to the best customer service for Georgians in need of such aid.
“We’re always focused on cutting down application and renewal processing times for the average SNAP recipient through better customer service and technology,” Brown wrote.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Relax. It’s just a “public education campaign.” 
That’s how some construction-related unions innocently describe how they’ll spend the million dollars they say they’ve raised to help pass the film tax credit bill state lawmakers are poised to consider in a special legislative session.
The unions’ money isn’t meant to be spent on next year’s election campaigns, Vince Saavedra with the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions recently told the Nevada Independent.
That must be reassuring to state legislators who might be on a ballot next year. They’re free to vote their conscience without fear of deep-pocketed special interests air- and cyber-bombing attack ads on them.
Unless of course the unions change their mind.
During the regular legislative session earlier this year, by the slimmest of margins, the state Assembly approved granting $1.4 billion in tax credits to the film industry. The movie and video corporations in turn would sell the credits at a discount to taxpaying Nevada companies, which in turn would get a tax break as a result of buying the credits, all of which would deprive the state of $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent on legitimate public expenses like schools and health care and public safety.
However, the state Senate failed to pass the measure, perhaps only because it ran out of time. 
The film tax credit won’t be on a special session agenda unless Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is sure it has enough votes to pass.
That means Lombardo, along with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, need to know which way all the legislators will vote before Lombardo can even call the special session.
Hence the urgency of unions bragging about a million-dollar war chest. 
Which they say won’t spend on next year’s election campaigns. 
But they could change their mind.
Maybe they already did.
The federal government shutdown casts uncertainty on a lot of things, and the timing of a legislative special session is one of them. But if rumblings within the Nevada political-media-industrial complex are on the mark, and hold, the special session would be in mid-November, which is coming up fast. Lombardo and legislative leaders need head counts sooner rather than later.
Meanwhile, another leader of the coalition of construction industry unions pushing the plan, Tommy White with Laborers Local 872, told the Associated Press the group’s million dollars would be spent on TV and digital ads and mailers.
And yet has anybody seen any evidence — million-dollar evidence, to be specific — of a “public education campaign” from the unions in support of the movie studio giveaway bill?
Perhaps a skeptic, or a state legislator, can be forgiven for suspecting the million bucks isn’t for public education, but being brandished as a threat to spend heavily against noncompliant legislators next year.
Diversifying with the stars
Along with “because we said so” and “or else,” the film tax credit’s evangelizers insist Nevada politicians should hand out public money to movie studios because doing so will somehow magically transform Southern Nevada’s economy and prosperity will rain down on everyone.
The unions’ argument starts with the claim that the film tax credits will mean 19,000 construction jobs.
That estimate is from an analysis commissioned by the movie studios that stand to receive the $1.4 billion in public handouts and that, ably guided by Howard Hughes Holdings, have been leading about half of Nevada’s state-level politicians around by the nose for at least the last three years.
Yet even that project-friendly analysis estimates a much more modest 12,643 “direct” construction jobs, “or 1,580 jobs per year.”
It also estimates about 9,300 direct non-construction jobs “at stabilization,” less than 6,000 of which would be employed by “motion picture and video industries.”
The Las Vegas area workforce is currently about 1,140,000 strong. If a Nevada economic development plan attracted 6,000 highly trained scientific and technical research and development professionals and about 10,000 additional scientific and technical support jobs centered around a complex of research laboratories packed with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of sophisticated equipment, that might diversify the Las Vegas metro area’s economy a little. 
Another 6,000 people in the entertainment industry, eh, not so much. 
And in a workforce the size of Southern Nevada’s, “1,580 jobs per year” in impermanant construction work isn’t economic diversification. It’s another day that ends in y.
Beyond film and construction work, the bulk of the rest of the employment associated with the tax credits would be in retail, hotels, food service, and office services. In other words, more of the same.
And that’s from a report paid for by the film studios who are trying to make the project look good.
The state’s publicly funded economic development agencies charged with diversifying the economy may want to shop around. For $1.4 billion, we can probably do better.
The deciders
To reiterate, the Assembly already passed the studio handout bill and could be expected to do so again. 
So if there is enough resistance to make Lombardo stop pretending a film tax credits scheme warrants a special legislative session, the state Senate is where it’s at. And, to reiterate, the state Senate has never voted on it.
There are 21 Nevada state senators. Eleven of their seats are up next year: 

SD2: Edgar Flores, D
SD8: Marilyn Dondero Loop, D
SD9: Melanie Schieble, D
SD10: Fabian Donate, D
SD12: Julie Pazina, D
SD13: Skip Daly, D
SD14: Ira Hansen, R
SD16: Lisa Krasner, R
SD 17: Robin Titus, R
SD20: Jeff Stone, R
SD21: James Ohrenschall, D

Some of these people have announced they’re seeking reelection, some haven’t. But these are the people most likely to be the targets of the construction unions’ “public education campaign.”
One of them, Robin Titus, is the leader of state Senate Republicans. She also declared earlier this week that she’s a hard no on the studio bill. (This thing has always been a Democratic scheme.)
And one additional Democratic state senator will be on the ballot next year, in the primary and, she hopes, the general election. Cannizzaro, the Senate majority leader, is running for attorney general. She’s also recently declared full-throated support for the film tax credit scheme.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will hold a press conference Friday afternoon to “discuss ICE operations and update on the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities,” according to a media advisory that has circulated on social media.
Protests are expected in the Twin Cities on Friday, organized by groups that oppose the agenda of President Donald Trump.
Noem was the governor of South Dakota until Trump appointed her as the head of the Department of Homeland Security, where she is the face of Trump’s campaign to deport immigrants by the millions. (Longtime Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski, however, has been described as the “shadow secretary” by DHS staff, NY Mag reports.)
Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.
On Trump’s orders, DHS has sent hundreds of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into American cities, where they have been accused of detaining people without due process, including at least 170 citizens. 
The media advisory provides no details of the contents of Noem’s “update.” But it comes amid the DHS’s push to send crews of ICE agents into blue cities — in some cases accompanied by the National Guard — and reports that ICE is in talks with private prison company CoreCivic to reopen a defunct Appleton prison as a 1,600-bed immigration detention center.
Protests are expected outside the federal Whipple Building Friday afternoon.

That high-court ruling is back in the spotlight after the arrests on Thursday of more than 30 people, including an NBA player and coach, in two cases alleging sprawling criminal schemes to rake in millions by rigging sports bets and poker games involving Mafia families.
What did the Supreme Court decide?
The court’s ruling struck down a 1992 federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion that the way Congress went about the gambling ban, barring states from authorizing sports betting, violated the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment, which protects the power of states.
“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Alito wrote. The court’s “job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”
The trouble with the law, Alito explained, was that Congress did not make betting on sports a federal crime. Instead, it prohibited states from authorizing legalized gambling, improperly infringing on their authority. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan joined Alito’s opinion.
Dissenting justices said the court should have acted more narrowly
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that even if the part of the law regulating the states’ behavior should be struck down, the rest of it should have survived. In particular, Ginsburg wrote that a separate provision that applied to private parties and betting schemes should have been left in place.
Writing for Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, Ginsburg said that when a portion of a law violates the Constitution, the court “ordinarily engages in a salvage rather than a demolition operation,” preserving what it can. She said that instead of using a “scalpel to trim the statute” her colleagues used “an axe.” Breyer agreed with the majority that part of the law must be struck down but said that should not have doomed the rest of the law.
But Alito, in his majority opinion, wrote that Congress did not contemplate treating the two provisions separately.
Opponents of gambling warned about corruption
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a former college and NBA star, was a sponsor of the law that he said was needed to protect against “the dangers of sports betting.”
All four major U.S. professional sports leagues and the NCAA had urged the court to uphold the federal law, saying a gambling expansion would hurt the integrity of their games. They also said that with legal sports betting in the United States, they’d have to spend a lot more money monitoring betting patterns and investigating suspicious activity.
The Trump administration also called for the law to be upheld.
Alito acknowledged in his majority opinion “the legalization of sports gambling is a controversial subject,” in part for its potential to “corrupt professional and college sports.”
He included references to the “Black Sox Scandal,” the fixing of the 1919 World Series by members of the Chicago White Sox, and the point-shaving scandal of the early 1950s that rocked college basketball.
But ultimately, he wrote, Congress couldn’t require states to keep sports gambling prohibitions in place.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25135471977857-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-10-24 13:02:05.368922

(Nathaniel Herz/KYUK and Northern Journal)A note from Northern Journal publisher and KYUK collaborator Nathaniel Herz:
Here’s a second piece from Jeron Joseph, a resident of the Western Alaska village of Kwigillingok who was forced to evacuate after a remnant typhoon flooded his village and destroyed some 35% of its buildings. The storm caused significant damage in more than a dozen villages in the region, and this week, President Donald Trump approved a federal disaster declaration in response.
In his first piece, Jeron, 30, whose Yup’ik name is Anguterayak, recounted his harrowing departure from his home amid rising floodwaters, and his evacuation from Kwigillingok by military helicopter to the Western Alaska regional hub town of Bethel. 
In this new account, he describes his flight from Bethel to Anchorage in a military transport plane, reuniting with his friends, family, and dog, and the early stages of settling into an environment that feels deeply foreign even if it’s within the same state. 
A few facts about Jeron that are worth keeping in mind as you try to grasp the new reality for him and hundreds of other evacuees: He rarely left Kwigillingok, known as Kwig — just for things like medical appointments and getting his state-issued identification renewed. All of those trips were to Bethel; the only other place in Alaska that he’s been is a town in the southeast part of the state, where his aunt brought him to visit a relative as a teenager. And he’s never had a driver’s license, never having needed one in Kwig. 
A night in Bethel
To begin with: I have been hearing many things about the first article, and I and many people from my community are so overwhelmed by the support, the love, and the messages — the well-wishes of strength and welfare that are being sent our way. We couldn’t be happier for those messages.
To begin where I left off: After we were dropped off by the helicopter in Bethel, we were hosted for the night there by one of my aunt’s nieces. I had a humorous exchange with her niece, where she almost tripped on one of my bags — I said to her, ‘It would be funny if, after all this, you were the one who got hurt.’
We spent a lot of the night catching up. We talked about the things we wished we would have brought with us, including sentimental items. The following morning, we were taken back to the hangar where we’d initially landed, so that we could take the morning flight to Anchorage. When we got there, we had some exchanges with friends and family, and it felt like this was the first time we were truly away from home. Up to that point, it just felt like we were passing by. That moment in the hangar where we saw a lot of our community members truly felt like going away.
Getting on the transport plane
They began boarding us onto that big C-17. None of us in the village had ever seen very large planes like that, and we were enthralled by the breadth of the plane.
Walking towards the loading bay on the tarmac, I would describe it as my own version of crossing the River Styx. As much as I wanted to, I didn’t look back at the hangar. I didn’t look back at the hangar because I knew I was going to start crying. My thought was that this is going to be the first day of the rest of our lives.

They began loading us onto the plane. A few elders sat in chairs along the walls, but the rest of us, they sat us down on the floor, row by row, no seats, no cushions. We all had to sit down as they strapped very long individual straps to each row of passengers that were supposed to act as seatbelts, but I’m fairly certain are for securing cargo.
We took off, and everyone who wasn’t in the chairs during that ascent, a lot of us had to hold on to that strap because we were sliding back, feeling like we were going to fall. There were exclamations of surprise among the passengers.
I don’t know if it was because of the exhaustion following what happened, but during the pressure changes, I had to do some mental gymnastics and really try to get a hold of my focus and my breathing so I wouldn’t pass out, because I was very close on a number of times during that flight.
My brother was also on the flight — I had texted him a message asking him to maintain eye contact with me so that my focus would have an anchor point, to keep me from passing out. Maybe two-thirds of the way into the flight, I had to break out a classic Barbra Streisand movie, the 60’s Technicolor gem “Funny Girl,” on my phone, because I have memories of watching that as a young adult. I couldn’t hear it because of the flight, but I was able to recite along in my mind because I listened to and watched it so much. That was able to calm me down.
Landing in Anchorage
I had gotten maybe 15 minutes into the movie when we began descending, and I could feel the pressure changes. All over again, I had to re-strategize my breathing. When we landed, I felt another moment of relief, and I embraced my aunt. There was applause among the passengers, cheering the landing. I was glad that that experience was over. My aunt described as being ‘crammed together like sardines.’

At the military base where we landed, they lined everyone from the plane up to get into a shuttle so that we could go back to the shelter at the Egan Center. I started seeing sights that I hadn’t seen since I was a teenager.
Growing up in the flat, watery plain of the Kuskokwim Delta all my life, I had forgotten about how imposing the urban structures and the trees are — because the sky at home is totally open. Maybe folks here think that the sky is pretty open already in some places. But at home, it always felt like a planetarium without an edge. I remember winter nights where I would stargaze and I could see the entire sky, horizon to horizon, and just lie down there admiring the beauty.
Trees are beautiful. Mountains are beautiful. The city skyline is beautiful. I love admiring it all, but I just miss the beauty I used to see.
Being here inland, now, of course, I don’t dislike it. But it just feels like I’m an ant at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and I have imposing structures all around me: trees, buildings, and mountains, all appearing to look down on me, and that certainly takes adjusting.

After landing, I’ve been experiencing the feeling of a whole new world where convenience is king. With our subsistence lifestyle, the relationship that we have with our resources is that they’ve always been rare and precious, and very tasty.
I don’t mean to disparage, but it feels like, here, everything’s so disposable. And I notice a mental complex where you can get everything at the snap of a finger. It creates this sort of detachment with resources, and it boggles me to see people wasting food and water, because that would actually be seen as a petrifying offense in the villages. That’s something that I might have to adjust to. Everybody is so nice and accommodating, but it’s still an adjustment.
Another thing that bewilders me, being before these palaces of convenience, is that, despite all that people have, they still plan for more. My assumption when I thought about this was, ‘Maybe there’s a brand of competitiveness here that makes people feel this way.’ Who could’ve put that feeling there? And why?
I’d like to say that when we were in our village, it felt like that was the entire world. That kind of insularity, though it may seem ignorant to some, is something that led to another feeling. It felt like we already had the world. That feeling created a neighborliness that is nigh unmatchable.
Reuniting with friends and family
At the Egan Center, where we were dropped off, we sat in the dining area and came across several of our friends and family who had also decided to come to Anchorage. I hadn’t realized this about other people’s faces until then, but it turns out that they can act as an anchor and a port for our emotions and feelings of home. Seeing those faces certainly eased the feeling of a whole new world.
We were talking amongst ourselves. We were talking about how we all missed our home, and a lot of us had gasped and ran up to other people we knew, being so grateful for each others’ safety. One of the ones that affected me the most, though, was seeing my own mom, who had been outside the village when the storm hit.

On the helicopter ride to Bethel, she had FaceTimed me and my family members, and we had all cried then. Thinking of the first time we’d be seeing each other in a new world, while saying goodbye to the place most precious to us that was in view of the helicopter window. How we wanted our feet to touch that ground one last time. When she saw us at the Egan Center, I was overwhelmed with another wave of tears.
The structures may be gone. Our home might have been declared unlivable. But I have the greatest assurance now that the people and the voices are still here. Those people and those voices that we have been through so much with, and that will go through so much more — through strangeness, through a lack of familiarity, and having to navigate a whole new concrete jungle. We’re still here.
After spending so much time talking and reuniting, my aunt and I were met by a relative who’d come to pick us up. We waited for our luggage. Then we were told it might not get there today. My aunt and I sighed, and then the relative took us to his home where we’d be staying, and he showed us around.
Getting settled
A number of things struck me as odd. The first was probably fences. I go back to how open everything feels in the tundra. Having to grasp property lines and stuff like that — of course, we want to be respectful, but it’s just still another new thing for us to adjust to.
We had the nicest time being able to settle ourselves in that relative’s home, but it was still hard. We could have been given the most comfortable parachute in the world, but it still wouldn’t be enough to alleviate our grief.
I had another moment of my own grief when I went out onto the deck and started crying again, because everything inside the house reminded me in some way of my home. That moment was actually catalyzed by seeing a towel rack that those relatives had brought back from the village. I hadn’t seen that towel rack since I was a child.
My aunt came out to the deck, and she had to console me for five minutes. I said to her, ‘Everything inside reminds me of home.’ And she said, ‘You’re crying. I know you’re hurting. But this is a whole new world for us, and you have to say goodbye and thank you to those times. We can’t get them back, but we’ll be able to make new ones when we can.’

I got inside to the room where they set me up. I didn’t have a change of clothes, other than some sweats that we had taken from the clothing drive at the Egan Center. Putting those clothes on made me realize how so many of us are so close to losing the things we’ve become accustomed to — the roof over your head, the clothes you wear, the food and water that are given to you. Being in that room and having no stuff gave me a whole new appreciation for the things that I used to enjoy in my little cave of a room at home.
The next day, or the day after that, we got our luggage, and we felt like we had gotten pieces of ourselves back. I know I mentioned my computer before — I got that, too. I set it up, I turned it on, and I was relieved to see that it still works. When I saw that my sheet music was still playable, that brought another whole new wave of relief, because I didn’t want to lose all of those years’ worth of work.
Finding friends and relatives
Someone I spoke to about the kinds of things I took from home — they thought it was interesting that I’d bring a dog and a computer. I told them, ‘I wanted to pack the village, but the luggage fee would’ve been disastrous.’
And I really wanted to. How I wanted to. But the more time we spent flying, the less we expected to see familiar faces, or familiar voices, in the place where we landed. Fellow Yup’iks who speak our language, Know our humor.
But my aunt and I were pleasantly surprised across these days of adjustment — meetings happened at the most unexpected times. You’re doing something mundane or habitual while out doing errands when out of the blue, a face from home or from neighboring villages surprises us. I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve said or heard: ‘Aaah! Oh my gosh, haven’t seen you! My name’s…’ And they’d tell us their Yup’ik names and how we’re related to them or their friends.
These exchanges validate what we’re feeling, what we miss. If you can’t picture what it feels like, imagine you’re in the most foreign, alien, nowherest nowhere you can think of, out of the States. Then you take a wrong turn, and there’s that Starbucks in the middle of nowhere. That’s how I would describe it.
A blanket for my soul
One specific meeting I experienced was just like this, though it wasn’t a surprise. My childhood best friend moved out of our village when we were in middle school. I texted him that I was in town, though I wished it was under better circumstances. He’d said something like, ‘Oh my gosh, where!!??’ I told him, and he said he was coming as soon as he could. I waited. I waited. I kept asking where he was. He told me to hold my pantaloons. He’s coming.
I saw a newspaper dispenser on the way to meet him. The image on the newspaper was of a helicopter. You can imagine what I was thinking then, and what I was feeling. I wished he was here. I wished it was now. I didn’t want to have to cry before I cried meeting him.
We met in an indoor space, and I saw his back where he was seated in a waiting area. My heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth and meet him before the rest of my body. I sprinted up to him. He heard me, he turned around, and I embraced him. He hung on to me. I smiled so much I could feel it in my ears. Years and years of anticipation dropped when we hugged in that waiting area. He whispered a little friendly joke in my ear, ‘Your shoes were squishing.’ I chuckled, and I cried tears of joy.
For the eight or so hours after we met, we literally didn’t stop talking — about my experience, our boyhood memories, and our inside jokes with our immediate friend group. He took me to his place and he started making salmon soup. Wild caught. Here was a whole new world before me, and I was freaking out over Yup’ik soup. Homestyle, for us. Having that bowl of salmon soup was like a blanket for my soul, made from the feeling of home. I relished each spoonful, slowly, not knowing when I’d have it again.

Picking up the dog
Going back to the day when we evacuated from Kwig on the chopper — I’m still raw thinking about this. We were told that the last kennel plane was full, and that my dog, my Jack Russell terrier, had to go on the next one. The thing was, the next kennel plane was scheduled for the day after we left.
You might be able to imagine the hole in my heart that that development bore into me. Nearly in tears, I walked up to the reception area at the school that served as the village shelter and asked who I could entrust my dog to. I was pointed to an overseer who we knew we could depend on. I was given every guarantee that my dog would be okay, but be that as it may, I still wasn’t certain in my heart that she would come.
When it came time to take our bags and ourselves to the fourwheeler and its trailer to head to the helicopter, my heart sank. I knew what else I was going to leave behind, but to leave my dog, even temporarily? I felt guilt, shame, and sadness. That she couldn’t understand we’d get her back.
The fourwheeler started rolling toward the village airstrip, and she started whining. I started crying. I cried all the way there. When we got to the airstrip, my brother had to embrace me as I cried loudly into his ear. Every turn brought back memories of the village, my family, my friends, and my dog. And losing my dog from my sight as she disappeared further from the horizon just rendered me into pieces.
Fast forward to the evening of the reunion with my friend, we were informed that our dog made it to a cargo depot. When I heard, I felt like a little boy who’s going to see his dog for the first time in weeks or months.
I could not sit still for the entire drive over. I kept talking to my aunt about some of the things my dog used to do, and also some of the things that we’d have to do, like getting nail clippers and a brush for her. And of course, she’s going to have to be housebroken in a whole new way, and mind her manners.

There was a little confusion at the cargo depot. We spent probably 10 or 15 minutes knocking on all the doors, and we were about to leave when we got a text saying we should bang harder. But before we could bang on the gate again, it opened and we saw our dog, Maundy. I named her after a dog who had died, as it is Yup’ik tradition to name a baby after someone who has recently passed. Though Maundy’s namesake, my mother’s dog, had passed before I could remember.
I walked up to her. I was so happy. I was flooded with memories of her, and how much of a little fussy brat she is sometimes. But I still love her. And this time, when she whined when she came back to us, I felt lifted up onto cloud nine.
As we’d gotten out of the storm and were settling in at our relative’s place, it had felt like we were on a merry-go-round for days. Once we had our luggage and our dog, and got to see all the familiar faces, it finally felt like we were able to sit down and just do nothing if we wanted to — which is also a precious thing.
We have a roof, we have our things. We have the things that I now believe we ought to be grateful for, like food and water. And I know I will never not be appreciative of our next meal ever again.
An emotional church service
Some days after we settled in, we had a number of logistical things that we had to do back at the relief center. One of the things that they organized there was a church service that included Yup’ik singers who used to sing in the affected villages.
I was able to get through the opening and the prayer okay. But when they got to the Yup’ik singers and the Yup’ik songs, I was reminded of my grandmother, Lena, whose Yup’ik name was Kayungiar. She used to take me to our Protestant Moravian church at home, where they had open singing.
The church was in the south part of town, which experienced the worst flooding — I don’t know what happened to it, and in some ways that feels worse. I wish I could know now, so that I could at least have some closure for that special place.
I had managed to bring a little Bible that my mom gave me in 2010. Having that additional connection to home, combined with the singing, brought me to tears again.
Some of the members of the congregation came up to me. They wrapped their arms around my shoulders, and they started saying prayers for me. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I actually had to get out of the service for a little bit, so that I could get my emotional equilibrium back.
There was a member of the Red Cross who asked me if I was okay. I explained my feelings to her. And she said, ‘I know it’s hard. You have so much you miss. But I know you can find some friendly faces here, so that you can make new church memories.’

Another person, in a blue vest, checked up on me as I went to go get some water; she told me she’s from an Episcopalian family on the East Coast, and couldn’t imagine how she’d feel if her own childhood church had been affected. It gave me great comfort to know that there were people who could sympathize with how I was feeling.
I said to the lady from the East Coast that my home is gone, the places I love are gone. But when I look at that church service, I know that the people and the voices are still here. And as far as I know, they will always be here, even if there’d be only one person left.
That is the sort of thing that I choose to think about when I’m in this alien world. For everyone reading, you could be that one person that I talk about. You could be the one to carry our traditions in your heart. You could be the shelter of our way of life. And as long as we have the people, as long as we have our language, I know that that lifestyle and that knowledge will never drift away. Typhoon or not.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A new online statewide directory has been launched to showcase and connect Alaska Native artists across disciplines.
The Alaska Native Arts Directory is the work of the nonprofit Alaska Native Arts Foundation. Listing is free. The directory went live last week, timing that coincided with the Alaska Federation of Natives annual convention in Anchorage.
As of Monday, about 200 artists were listed, most of them with photos and biographical information. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation said it is seeking to expand that number to more than 1,000 by next year.
The Anchorage-based foundation said it also has a goal of holding a first-ever Alaska Native Arts Economic Summit next year, bringing together artists, policymakers and other partners to work on building the Indigenous creative economy.
There are other artists’ directories in Alaska, some of them with a focus on Indigenous artists. One, the Collective49 Marketplace, enables member artists to promote and sell their work online. And there are numerous local artists directories, such as those in Ketchikan and Homer.
The Alaska Natives Art Directory, however, is intended to be more comprehensive. Along with being statewide, the directory includes writers, musicians and other performing artists along with those who create carvings, paintings and other physical works of art. It includes contemporary art forms as well as traditional Indigenous arts.
“The Alaska Native Arts Directory celebrates the full spectrum of Alaska Native creativity, visual and written arts, performance, design, and traditional practices, reflecting the diversity and vitality of Alaska’s Indigenous cultures,” Gail Schubert, chair of the Alaska Native Arts Foundation, said in a statement.
Launch of the Alaska Native Arts Directory represents a renaissance of sorts for the Alaska Native Arts Foundation.
The foundation was created in 2002 and for several years operated an ecommerce site and a gallery in Anchorage. But it shut down those operatioons in 2016 after losing state funding and encountering other financial problems.
The directory project and other new activities now have a variety of funding sources, according to the foundation’s statement. The effort is backed by grants and other support from organizations that include the Rasmuson Foundation, the U.S. Small Business Administration, the office of U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the Alaska State Council on the Arts and the Municipality of Anchorage, among others, according to the statement.

(Photo courtesy Indiana State Fair Commission)Cindy Hoye, who has led the Indiana State Fair Commission since 2004, will step down in 2026 after a nearly 40-year career with the organization.
In a Thursday announcement, the commission praised Hoye’s “visionary service” and credited her with re-shaping the fairgrounds and state fair “into what (they) are today.”
“(Hoye’s) remarkable tenure leaves behind a legacy of excellence, innovation and unwavering dedication,” the commission said in a social media release. “Thank you, Cindy, for 40 incredible years of leadership and impact!”
Hoye, who became executive director in 2004 after serving 16 years as the commission’s marketing director, said serving as executive director was “an absolute honor and incredible privilege.” 
“With the State Fair’s roots deeply planted in its mission, this place will always hold a special significance for me and most importantly for Hoosiers across the state,” she said in a statement. “I am immensely proud to have worked alongside one of the greatest teams of people you’ll ever encounter. Their sense of pride, purpose, and relentless pursuit of excellence is truly remarkable.”
Hoye added that the State Fairgrounds are “in capable hands, guided by a clear and strategic roadmap for continued success.”
Her tenure is marked by a number of major initiatives and projects. 
Hoye oversaw renovation of the Corteva Coliseum and construction of the Indiana Farm Bureau Fall Creek Pavilion, as well as expansions of 4-H programming, She additionally helped attract high-profile track-and-field events — including the NCAA Division II National Championships, Big Ten Championships and the Hoosier State Relays — to Indianapolis and the fairgrounds campus.
Gov. Mike Braun described Hoye’s tenure as “remarkable” and said she “elevated” the commission.
“Her unwavering commitment to the State of Indiana, to her staff, and to leaving the Fair and Fairgrounds better than she found it, has set a standard of excellence that will continue to guide us for years to come,” the governor said in a statement.
The commission has initiated a search for Hoye’s successor, and she will assist in the transition ahead of her official retirement in March, agency officials said.

Some members of the Parole Working Group established by Gov. Mike Kehoe wanted to require more than the current system, which starts at 15% of a sentence for the lowest-level offenders and peaks at 85% for the most violent. Others urged a system with a standard that would lower the population of Missouri’s prisons — currently about 24,000 — with releases tied to personal growth.
Without agreement, the report highlights that it makes no recommendation on the question, Trevor Foley, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, said in an interview with The Independent.
“I wanted the governor to understand that this was a big debate and that the working group did not land on consensus here,” Foley said. “Ultimately, (Board of Probation and Parole Chairman Tony Helfrecht) and I determined that any policy to get more people in prison or fewer people in prison wasn’t really the scope of the order.”
The group’s final report lays out how some practices, listed in a departmental policy book, will become formal department rules, and how other rules will be revised or reorganized. It also recommends changes to medical parole and sets a higher bar for decisions to revoke probation and return a person to custody.
It was silent on whether parole policies fixed in state law should be changed because members decided that was outside the scope of their study.

“Prior to doing this, the board could unilaterally alter those guidelines at any time they want,” Foley said of the policies being moved into formal rules. “Now, by moving them into rules, those become an open-forum, public policy debate of what should the minimum percentages be for eligibility or the maximums, or how should it apply to different offenses.”
Critics, both inside and outside the working group, weren’t impressed with the report’s conclusions. 
Newton County Prosecutor Will Lynch said he pushed for a rule requiring every person sentenced to state prison to remain in custody for at least 50% of their term.
“The recommendations and outcomes don’t necessarily fix what I believe is wrong with parole in Missouri,” Lynch said.
Amy Malinowski, Missouri director of the MacArthur Justice Center, said the working group ducked the toughest questions.
“They’re just announcing things that are either already the case or that they’re already required to do,” she said. “And we are supposed to take that as reform.”
Kehoe’s office released the working group’s report on Oct. 3. Both Foley and Helfrecht told The Independent that they believe the final report met the governor’s goal of “promoting consistent and equitable decision-making for parole decisions” and his directive to do so by revising agency rules to provide “clarity, transparency, and accountability for the parole process.”
The new rules must be published in the Missouri Register, which opens a period for public comment and requires legislative review before taking effect. The proposed rules are being reviewed by Kehoe’s office, Foley and Helfrecht said, and will be published when the governor approves them.
Much of the five-page report focuses on how some practices, listed in a departmental policy book, will become formal department rules, and how other rules will be revised or reorganized.
“Prior to doing this, the board could unilaterally alter those guidelines at any time they want,” Foley said. “Now, by moving them into rules, those become an open-forum, public policy debate of what should the minimum percentages be for eligibility or the maximums, or how should it apply to different offenses.”
 Parole eligibility

To determine exactly how much time any person sentenced to a term in a Missouri state prison will serve depends on a number of factors — the level of the offense, whether it is considered a violent crime or dangerous felony, the person’s criminal history and how long they were held before conviction.
Missouri has five levels of felony. Under department rules, non-violent offenders in those classes must serve 15% of their sentence, or just over 12 months of a maximum 7-year term for a Class D felony. 
By statute, the minimum for the same sentence, if the person is being incarcerated for a second time, is 40%, or almost three years. And if it is the fourth time being sent to prison, the minimum is 80%, or five and one-half years.
Foley called Missouri’s criminal sentencing laws “phenomenally complicated” and noted they are “frequently litigated.” 
Some issues aren’t related to how the rules apply but how credit for time served on a sentence is awarded.
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

The department is currently in court over how a records officer calculated that a man with a 23-year sentence must be in custody for 41 years. Deandre Pointer of Kansas City was convicted of first degree murder, second degree murder and two counts of armed criminal action in 2005, receiving consecutive life sentences. 
His sentence was vacated and he was resentenced to 23 years in 2023, but he was given credit for time served only on one of the new terms because his previous sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. Instead of being eligible for release in 2024, he must wait until 2044.
Foley said he could not directly comment because of the litigation, but he defended the work of the records officers and said it complied with the law.
But even simple sentences can be handed down without certainty for any party. During an interview this summer with The Independent, Boone County Circuit Judge Brouck Jacobs, who represented the judiciary in the working group, said he was seeking ways to make sentencing clearer to defendants and crime victims.
“They think somebody’s got seven years for breaking into their home, a burglary,” Jacobs said, “and then I think they’re shocked and chagrined when the person’s out in a year-and-a-half.”
Foley said he thinks the changes will help, but that any significant revision of how sentencing and parole interplay is up to state lawmakers. Determining the parole eligibility date for is a “math problem” where all the variables aren’t known until the person being incarcerated is received by the department, Foley said.
“The goal would be, at the day of sentencing in the courtroom, does every stakeholder understand the implications of that sentence?” Foley said. “Because right now, they don’t.”
 Detailed recommendations

The report isn’t all just reference to revisions to match current practices and reorganization of sections in the Code of State Regulations.
An incarcerated person in a parole hearing will have the ability to bring two representatives of their choice to provide information about rehabilitation efforts or barriers to release.
“That might not sound like a huge deal, but it’s a tough decision for some of these folks to make, who they’re going to have there to represent them,” Helfrecht said. “They can bring up such things as a solid home plan, where they are going to live, their employer and family support. Now they can even have representation.”
Amy Malinowski, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Missouri office (photo submitted).
Malinowski, however, doesn’t share Helfrecht enthusiasm about that change.
It is “the only sort of substantive change that I saw” related to Kehoe’s stated goals, she said.
“But that’s it,” Malinowski said. “You know, they worked all summer, and this is it.”
Some of the other detailed recommendations would:

Streamline the parole process by foregoing formal hearings for some low-level offenders, who often arrive eligible for parole because of time served in a county jail.
Remove the requirement that a prisoner paroled for medical reasons have a treatment plan in place before being released.
Require allegations of a parole violation such as a new crime to be proven before the Parole Board holds a revocation hearing, and for the board to “only consider revocation when a preponderance of evidence is found regarding new law violations or technical violations associated with community risk.”

The changes to the requirements for medical parole will align the policy with the statute, which does not require a treatment plan as a condition for release, Foley said. Medical parole can be considered for individuals who have a terminal disease, require long-term nursing care or have a health issue that would be made worse by continued incarceration.
While the availability of care will no longer be a factor in the decision, Foley said the situation of the person being considered for parole will be a concern.
The prison population is aging — almost 25% of offenders are older than 50 — and every prison has a nursing unit. Finding a nursing home willing to accept someone released from prison is difficult, Foley said.
“I do think we likely would be concerned about putting forth a medical parole packet to the board when that individual had no place to go,” Foley said. “We’re not interested in people dying homeless on the street.”
One change not reflected in the report is a revised form that will summarize the findings of the three-member parole hearing panel. 
On the current form, when parole is denied, often the only reason provided is that “release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the present offense…”
The new form shows how the panel evaluated the offense, whether it was violent or sexual in nature and whether drugs were involved. Drug and alcohol history also spills into the person’s time in custody, and whether they have completed substance abuse treatment.
Four categories cover the person’s time in prison and on supervised release previously and with evaluations for conduct violations, program participation and whether the person had new offenses while incarcerated.
The final category is a catch-all for any reason not previously considered, including whether there is community opposition or the person has a stable post-release plan.
Working group member Courtney Everett, coordinator of the St. Louis University Prison Education Program, said in an interview this summer that the form needed revisions to provide more detail.
In an email about the final report, Everett said he was pleased at the openness of others in the 15-member working group, dominated by law enforcement and corrections officials, to consider his recommendations.
“A violent crime will always be violent, so denying a person parole because of the seriousness of their crime is punishing them for issues beyond their control and the opposite of what is best for public safety,” Everett said. “I did bring this up and the group agreed that this is an issue, however I don’t see this mentioned explicitly in the report.”
Helfrecht defended the current form but agreed more information would help document board decisions.
“Whenever we make a decision,” he said, “we make a decision for our offenders, but we also make it for the safety of our communities and our victims.” 
 Hurried process?

In the Jan. 13 executive order establishing the working group, Kehoe set Oct. 1 as the deadline for delivering a report. The panel held one public hearing on June 13 and completed the report on Sept. 18.
But not every member of the working group left the final meeting with the understanding that the report was final. In an email five days before Kehoe released it, Everett said he was expecting a final meeting to go over the report prior to it being delivered.
Secret meetings of parole study group may violate Missouri Sunshine Law

And after it was released, Everett said he had not seen the final version prior to its delivery and noted the cover letter was dated Sept. 19.
“We should have had an opportunity to see the final language before it was submitted to the governor to ensure we were all in agreement,” Everett said. “I don’t know if there would have been any revisions or further discussion, but I think one final round of eyes on the document would have been productive.”
Foley and Helfrecht said they tried to make it clear that the Sept. 18 meeting would be the last.
At the public hearing in June, 14 people signed up to give comments but only three actually spoke, including Malinowski. All other meetings were held in private. While the working group accepted written comments, it took no other public testimony.
“I would have loved for victims of crime to have the opportunity to come in and say, ‘here’s how the current system affected me,’” Lynch said.
Everett also said more public hearings would have helped the working group.
“I feel that everyone tried their best but we could have benefited from more interaction with the people most impacted by our decisions,” he said. “We could have benefited from more than one public hearing and having a research professional in the group would have been an asset.”
The working group did not have to hold any public hearings, Foley and Helfrecht said, because Kehoe directed the working group to include representation of a variety of perspectives.
But they said the lack of feedback at the public hearing, which was scheduled for up to three hours, was a surprise.
“I’ll be honest, we were stunned,” Foley said.
“I wish that meeting would have been longer,” Helfrecht said. “I wish we would have had more speakers.”
A more robust report that met the governor’s goals was possible, Malinowski said. The parole board doesn’t need legislative action to open its hearings to the public, give offenders their case files or change how decisions are stated.
“There is a lot they could have done if they had taken ownership of this opportunity,” she said. “I think they could have done more with the time they had.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Algoa-Correctional-Center-04022025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 10:00:53.054680

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)TOPEKA — While Kansas remains one of the last states in the nation without legalized medical or recreational marijuana, THC-infused drinks have evaded scrutiny from officials.
The question of the legality of the drinks came up Thursday at a meeting of a joint legislative committee on security.
Robert Stuart, executive officer for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, explained to lawmakers that while marijuana is illegal in Kansas, THC-infused beverages are considered hemp products and allowed under the 2018 federal Farm Bill, which legalized cannabis plants containing no more than 0.3% of a plant’s weight in tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Products created using hemp are commonly advertised as Delta 9 items, and they can have a weaker effect than marijuana because of their lower THC content.
Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican from Leavenworth, asked Stuart: “Should we be outlawing it?”
Yes, Stuart said, and he wagered the KBI’s position would be the same.
“If it’s intoxicating, it’s damaging,” he said.
THC drinks are restricted to adults over the age of 21, same as alcoholic beverages.
“You hear all sorts of social arguments and all sorts of different ways of thinking about it,” Stuart said, “but it would be much clearer for any of those distributors, any of those dealers, for any member of the public, to say, OK, this is what’s clearly illegal and clearly what’s not.”
Blurred lines make it difficult for retailers to comply with state laws, for consumers to know the products they purchase are safe and for law enforcement to conduct criminal investigations, Stuart said.
Kansas City, Missouri-based brewer Boulevard Brewing Company announced this month a THC-infused version of its signature Quirk seltzer, which will be called “Berry Jane.” It will be available in two dosages. One containing 5 mg THC and another containing 10 mg, differentiated by a darker can. They are expected to be sold in Kansas and Missouri next month.
The KBI celebrated a major crackdown on THC products earlier this month, raiding 10 storefronts in six cities across the state. KBI director Tony Mattivi said the products were harming Kansas children.
The Kansas House passed a bill legalizing marijuana in 2021, and a special committee crafted recommendations for the Legislature last year, but Republicans have blocked the legislation from progressing.

It’s here and it’s happening. The recent revelations about Republicans “joking” about an affinity for Nazism should wake us up to the reality of the moment. When President Donald Trump says immigrants have “bad genes” and are “poisoning the blood of our country,” he has raised the specter of eugenics that thrived in our country and of course in Germany during the 1930s.  There’s a direct line from this thinking to the Holocaust.
We need look no further than Minnesota for insight into this ugly history. During the early 20th century, Minnesota and many other states passed eugenics laws to support so-called racial purification. Laws in 31 states allowed the sterilization of mentally disabled and “feeble-minded” people, epileptics and more. Minnesota passed a sterilization law in 1925, and more than 2,000 people — mostly women — were sterilized. In California around 20,000 were sterilized from 1917 to 1952.
Through the 1930s, American scientists at the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Lab in New York promoted eugenics and maintained a Eugenics Record Office. David Starr Jordan, who wrote early major works on the fishes of North America and was president of Stanford University, was a white supremacist and supported forced sterilization programs aimed at poor Black, Indigenous and Hispanic women as well as the mentally disabled. 
We know that Charles Lindbergh, the Minnesotan famous for his solo flight across the Atlantic, was a eugenicist and talked of preserving the inheritance of European blood and guarding against its dilution by foreign races. He praised Hitler. Margaret Sanger, who was the first president of Planned Parenthood, was a eugenicist.
The Minnesota Eugenics Society was founded in 1923 by Charles F. Dight, who served as president until his death in 1938. He actively promoted reproduction of the “fit” and race betterment (the State Fair held “fit family” contests). 
During the 1930s, Dight communicated with Hitler, praising him for his plan to “stamp out mental inferiority among the German people” and “advance the eugenics movement.” If carried out effectively, Dight wrote, “it will make him the leader of the greatest national movement for human betterment the world has ever seen.” 
Our country has had a history of restricting immigrants, e.g. the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act that limited immigrants from eastern and southern Europe and Japan. 
Trump castigates immigrants as criminals and insane, even though immigrants have lower crime rates than that of American citizens. 
How could the President release 1,500 convicted insurrectionists yet push to deport immigrants? He’s likely a true believer in the nonsensical race science that was predominant a century ago.  
Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde, who spent a quarter century in Minnesota, told Trump at the now famous prayer service early this year, “The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings; who labor in poultry plants and meatpacking plants; who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals — they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation. But the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good neighbors.”
Aren’t we all the immigrants or the descendants of immigrants? And don’t we all have defects? 
Let us not forget: We are called to protect the vulnerable, to treat everyone as equals, to “do unto others as we would have them do unto us.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/08-05-Lindbergh-in-Cottonwood-County-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-24 09:02:46.544809

San Francisco has avoided an aggressive immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump — for now. 
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, Bay Area officials and residents remain on alert after Trump called off his plans on Thursday for a “surge” of federal immigration enforcement in San Francisco. The move comes a day after the president sent about 100 federal agents to Coast Guard Island in nearby Alameda, prompting state and city leaders to denounce the potential deployment of federal troops in San Francisco. 
In a social media post, Trump cited discussions with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and calls with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as reasons why he canceled the show-of-force. (After receiving public backlash, Benioff — who does not primarily live in San Francisco — walked back comments he made earlier this month supporting the deployment of the National Guard to the city).
Trump’s post ended with the phrase, “Stay tuned!”
On Thursday morning, protestors gathered at the entrance to the Alameda military base, where federal agents used a flash-bang grenade and pepper powder to disperse the crowd, according to KQED. At least two arrests were made.
Meanwhile, Lurie said that San Francisco “remains prepared for any scenario.” In Oakland — where Trump previously floated sending federal troops — its Mayor Barbara Lee said the city stands “ready to support our residents through every legal and appropriate means available.”
And Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the office is continuing to monitor the region “as the days progress.”

Crofts-Pelayo, in an emailed statement: “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason — and heard what we have been saying from the beginning. The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we’ve done.”

Speaking of Trump and Newsom:

Vetoing bills: Newsom spiked more than 100 pieces of legislation this session, citing Trump and “hostile” federal policies in several of his veto messages. Read more from CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow. 


Planned Parenthood funding: Newsom on Thursday said the state will invest more than $140 million to assist California’s remaining Planned Parenthood clinics. Earlier this year the Trump administration banned the clinics, which is the state’s largest abortion provider, from receiving federal Medicaid payments. About 80% of Medi-Cal patients use Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care, cancer screenings and primary care check ups. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.

Marines’ misfire

California congressmembers are calling for an investigation as more details emerge about the Marine artillery mishap over Interstate 5 on Saturday, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
In a planned demonstration involving firing 60 rounds of artillery at San Diego County’s Camp Pendleton, an apparent misfire ended up scattering shrapnel over the coastal freeway. The shrapnel struck a California Highway Patrol motorcycle and an empty patrol vehicle. The demonstration was in celebration of the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary, which was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
Public safety officials and former members of the military said the demonstration’s location was unusual, and that live-fire training typically takes place on designated ranges within the base.
U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, a Democrat who represents the district that includes Camp Pendleton, sent a letter to Hegseth demanding answers to questions about the incident, including who decided to shoot live artillery over the freeway. Twenty-six other California congressmembers and the state’s two senators also signed the letter.

Levin, to CalMatters: “I’m led to believe the decision-making did not put public safety first.”

Clamping down on police data

Los Angeles County leaders are calling on their sheriff to limit license plate reader data sharing after CalMatters found that some law enforcement agencies were illegally sharing the data with federal immigration agencies, write Phoebe Huss of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network and Khari Johnson.
The county’s board of supervisors submitted the motion in September, requesting that the sheriff’s department not use license plate data it collects for non-criminal immigration enforcement. They also called for the department to conduct privacy training for deputies and delete plate sightings after 60 days, unless the plates are flagged on criminal lists.
The request cited a June CalMatters report, which found that a dozen Southern California police and sheriff’s departments shared such data with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection — despite a 2015 state law banning California law enforcement agencies from sharing license plate reader data with federal entities.
CalMatters did not find that the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department shared data with ICE or the Border Patrol, but some L.A.-area agencies did. The sheriff’s department says it “welcomes” the request and will review its policies.

Nearly 80% of voters are concerned with affording health care, according to the latest poll by the California Wellness Foundation. Close to 40% of Californians surveyed also said they know someone whose mental health has worsened due to immigration raids under the current administration. Read more about the poll’s findings from CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Which CT social services could the government shutdown affect?,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/ct-social-services-government-shutdown/,Connecticut would feel the effects of a continued shutdown on federally funded programs around nutrition assistance and child care.,"November is a critical month in the federal government shutdown if it drags on for at least a couple of more weeks — and Connecticut would feel the effects across a few federally funded programs, namely around nutrition assistance and child care.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, would temporarily come to a halt starting Nov. 1 in Connecticut and other states. And two local Head Start centers face an imminent funding lapse in federal dollars next month, though at least one confirmed it plans to keep operating through November.
As the shutdown enters its fourth week, the federal workforce has largely felt the brunt of the government’s closure, with furloughed and essential employees starting to miss paychecks. But the pain of a shutdown will be felt more broadly if it stretches into the next month and imperils social services predominantly for lower-income households.
On top of that, open enrollment for health plans on the state’s insurance exchange, Access Health CT, begins on Nov. 1. Enrollees face possible premium hikes in 2026 if federal subsidies aren’t renewed before then. The expiration of those subsidies and their future are at the heart of the shutdown fight in Congress.
Of the federal programs that could face significant disruptions or cuts in the coming month, SNAP would take the biggest hit, unless the Trump administration can find a way to keep it going. Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal joined other colleagues in a letter urging the USDA to use its contingency fund to pay out November benefits for SNAP.
But other benefits supported by federal dollars remain more in limbo or largely unaffected in the near term. The state said it has enough resources to keep the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program afloat for at least another month.
For Head Start, two programs in Connecticut won’t receive new federal grants expected on Nov. 1 if a shutdown persists. The state is looking for ways to temporarily support them, though exact plans haven’t been finalized.
The culmination of these funding cliffs on Nov. 1 could be a pressure point to jumpstart talks, but meaningful negotiations between the two parties have yet to come to fruition. The shutdown is currently the second longest in U.S. history.
More than three weeks into the shutdown, there has been little to no movement on reopening the government. Democrats are still pressing for extending the expiring health care subsidies in order to secure their votes, while Republicans say the issue should be dealt with separately and shouldn’t be attached to a funding bill.
The Senate has taken a dozen votes on the Republicans’ bill to fund the government through Nov. 21, but enough Democrats have opposed that bill to block it from advancing, including both of Connecticut’s U.S. senators. Meanwhile, the House has been out of session since late September since passing the short-term funding bill, referred to as a continuing resolution.
That standstill in Congress has officials and advocates in the state awaiting some of the toughest cuts so far. And while Connecticut will not feel the full force of shutdown disruptions next month, the state will inevitably face additional funding issues in a long-term scenario.
“As we stare down the barrel of this Nov. 1 date, to me, the fact that the House isn’t even in session tells me that here at the food bank, we have to be prepared for no SNAP on Nov. 1,” Jason Jakubowski, Connecticut Foodshare president and CEO, said.
Nutrition assistance
If SNAP pauses on Nov. 1, about 360,000 beneficiaries in Connecticut will not receive their monthly benefits for November and won’t be able to use their existing balances until a shutdown ends.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture sent states a recent memo warning “there will be insufficient funds to pay full November … benefits.” The federal guidance directs states to effectively shut down the Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards. Benefits are loaded onto those cards, which are used by beneficiaries to help purchase groceries.
The lack of access to benefits, however, would be temporary. Recipients won’t lose any benefits currently stored on their EBT cards, according to guidance from the state Department of Social Services. But because of the uncertainty around the government reopening, DSS is recommending people spend the balances on their cards by Oct. 31. 
By November, the EBT cards are expected to shut off. Once the shutdown ends, recipients will regain access to the benefits that remain on their cards.
Connecticut distributes about $75 million per month in federal SNAP benefits, with many households receiving about $190. The federal government covers the costs of SNAP benefits, while it splits the administrative expenses evenly with the state, though that funding structure is subject to change in the future due to reforms in President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
Officials are looking into possible state interventions, but their options are limited. Connecticut was able to temporarily fund another federal nutrition program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. WIC serves about 52,000 people in the state, including women who are nursing or pregnant as well as young children. The expectation is that the state will get reimbursed by the federal government once a shutdown ends.
There are also talks among state officials and legislative leaders about beefing up emergency aid to food pantries and banks. If SNAP funding dries up next month, that will put increasing pressure on local food pantries to fill the need.
Connecticut Foodshare has been in daily talks with state officials about how the state might step in with nutrition assistance at risk. The group works with more than 600 food pantries across the state as well as 110 mobile sites.
With Nov. 1 approaching, Jakubowski said the focus is on the existing network of pantries and ensuring they have enough food to meet the increased demand. But if the shutdown goes beyond that, he said, they’ll need to seriously consider setting up emergency food distribution sites for the month of December — similar to what they did during the pandemic.
Advocates see cuts to food aid not only having a direct effect on families and other beneficiaries but also a larger economic impact on the stores and retailers that accept SNAP. Connecticut has about 2,500 SNAP retailers, with those dollars making up 5% to 15% of their business.
And they worry about how other shutdown-related cuts could have a ripple effect.
“Those don’t directly affect us, but there’s absolutely an indirect effect of those things,” Jakubowski said about cuts to heating aid and other federal programs. “There is definitely a residual effect. That’s less money they have to spend on groceries.”
Head Start centers
More Head Start centers — early childhood services that serve low-income children from birth to age 5 — could also feel the financial pinch of the shutdown heading into November. And that could cause disruptions in the coming weeks across the country.
These programs get federal grants on different timelines. Only half a dozen have been operating without federal funding this month. But an additional 134 programs will face a similar outcome in November in an ongoing shutdown, including two in Connecticut, according to the National Head Start Association.
In Connecticut, two centers won’t get access to federal resources when their grant cycle starts on Nov. 1 in the event of an ongoing shutdown: EdAdvance, a Regional Educational Service Center that serves western Connecticut, and Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County in Stamford. Between those centers, they have a combined 395 slots that serve children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
Connecticut’s Office of Early Childhood is working to fund these programs temporarily for one month, though the plans haven’t been finalized, according to Maggie Adair, the communications and legislative program manager for the OEC.
EdAdvance was supposed to get its five-year federal grant starting on Nov. 1. But to help with an expected funding lapse, it will get some of its allotted state funding for the year early, executive director Jonathan Costa said. That will help EdAdvance stay open through November, though he noted they will need to evaluate things if the government remains closed heading into December. 
As of this week, all Head Start centers across the country remained open amid the shutdown. But one program in Florida is poised to closed down on Monday, according to National Head Start Association deputy director Tommy Sheridan.
During the 2013 shutdown, Connecticut was one of half a dozen states that saw closures of Head Start centers, including one in Bridgeport.
Winter heating assistance
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, also faces funding issues next month. But Connecticut will be in the clear, at least in the short term.
DSS administers LIHEAP grants to largely fund the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, which provides subsidies to low-income households to help with their heating bills during the winter months.
The Connecticut Energy Assistance Program has more than $7 million in funds that were unspent from the past winter. The state anticipates that funding to last them midway or through the end of November, and it indicated they are looking into other options if the shutdown dips into December.
“The state of Connecticut has about $7 million in carryforward funds to assist eligible households with their home heating costs. We anticipate funding will last through mid-to-late November and are working on making sure families continue to receive the help they need to stay warm this winter and are evaluating options if the Federal Budget impasse continues past November,” DSS spokesperson Christine Stuart said in a statement.
Demand is expected to grow this winter, with the Lamont administration projecting more than 100,375 households needing heating assistance.
Other states are seeing a more immediate effect on their LIHEAP funding. Pennsylvania announced this week it’s delaying the opening of its energy assistance program by a month because of the budget impasse in Washington.
Open enrollment for Obamacare plans
Funding disruptions caused by the shutdown are happening at the same time that households are receiving notices about how much more they could pay for health plans next year if premium subsidies expire.
About 150,000 Connecticut residents purchase coverage through Access Health CT, and about 90% of those benefit from a federal subsidy.
Even without that tax credit, enrollees in Connecticut will still have access to some financial support, but residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for health insurance, according to Access Health CT. 
Connecticut could see some of the highest premium increases in the country if the enhanced premium subsidies go away, particularly for enrollees over the age of 60, according to a report from KFF.
Open enrollment for 2026 plans runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 for those who want their plans to begin in January. For those who want to enroll in a plan that starts in February, residents have until Jan. 15.
As people weigh their options, officials in the state recommend holding off on immediately enrolling to see if Congress resolves the shutdown and the impasse over the Affordable Care Act subsidies. 
“If you could, wait a little bit longer,” Access Health CT CEO James Michel said Tuesday. “Instead of enrolling on Nov. 1, give it more time, because I know there’s conversations going on right now to try to get the subsidies resolved.”

While the need for rooftop solar is not going away, federal tax incentives are, which is why it's important for state and local governments to step up, Josh Tulkin writes. (Photo by Joe DelNero /National Renewable Energy Laboratory)This past summer, Maryland experienced record-breaking energy use and record-high electricity bills due to record-breaking heat. As we enter the fall and will soon face colder weather, it is critical that Maryland continues to seek ways to lower energy costs for Marylanders and connect more energy to our grid.
Installing rooftop solar and battery storage brings energy independence to residents looking to lower their energy bills and move away from reliance solely on the grid. Unfortunately, Congress has ended tax credits designed to encourage energy conservation and incentivize people to install solar and battery storage in their homes.
It is now incumbent on local and state governments to take all steps in their power to promote adoption of conservation and solar. While local governments can’t replace federal tax credits or control tariffs, they can still have a huge impact. They can cut red tape, offer their own incentives, speed up permitting and drive down the soft costs.
High upfront costs are among the top reasons Americans who want to put solar on their roofs and batteries in their garages haven’t done so yet. One of the ways we make things cheaper is by cutting down costs in the process. Thankfully, Maryland has already been working to make solar more affordable and passed the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, which, among many cost-cutting provisions, requires local jurisdictions to adopt more effective permitting technology.

Enter SolarAPP+, which stands for Solar Automated Permit Processing (plus other clean energy technologies). In 2021, I was proud when Montgomery County started piloting the ‘SolarAPP+’ Platform to instantly approve solar permits for residents. Montgomery County has shared that residential rooftop solar projects that go through SolarAPP+ have been passing their inspections at a 30% higher rate than those submitted through the traditional route.
We cheered when lawmakers passed the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, which added funding to support the requirement for Maryland jurisdictions to use solar permitting software to automate the process for residential rooftop solar and home energy storage installations. In 2025, we conducted outreach, hosted educational webinars with guests from the Maryland Energy Administration and SolarAPP+, and engaged with dozens of volunteer leaders across the state to inform them about this game-changing software.
And there’s been some good news in 2025: We were thrilled to hear that, in June, Prince George’s and Worcester counties were awarded the Maryland Energy Administration’s first SolarAPP Implementation Grant. In July, MEA relaunched a fiscal ’26 Maryland SolarAPP+ Implementation Grant Program, setting the stage for additional jurisdictions to onboard, train and support adding this automated tool to their tool belts.
We have heard that Kent County, Salisbury and Rockville launched their SolarAPP+ portals and that Prince George’s, Wicomico, and Worcester counties are all going through the onboarding process as I write this.
As we head into another high-energy-use season and with federal solar tax credits disappearing soon, it is essential that SolarAPP+ get launched in time for residents to take advantage of it. This crunch season is critically important, and far too many jurisdictions are lagging behind.
We have been supportive of adopting this technology as it aligns with our values of making clean energy accessible to more people. SolarAPP+ was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and building safety officials and is now run by an independent nonprofit foundation, with additional support from Maryland Energy Administration grants.
We call on jurisdictions to move swiftly to adopt SolarAPP+, apply for the implementation grant from MEA, and ultimately comply with the law. Making rooftop solar easier for Marylanders is one thing we can all agree on.
Will this solve all of the problems with solar? No – but it is something we can do now, even as federal opportunities dry up. Now is not the time for backsliding; it’s the time to add clean, affordable sunshine into the mix for as many rooftops as are ready for it.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/53515164850_6f123440fb_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 09:02:46.544809
,California,2025-10-24 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom cited 3 main reasons in his vetoes this year. Trump was one,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/gavin-newsom-vetoes-2025/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 bills this year, citing fiscal restraint — and Donald Trump.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 bills this year, citing fiscal restraint — and Donald Trump.


Sen. Anna Caballero is one of California’s most influential lawmakers, since she is in charge of a committee that decides in secret to kill hundreds of bills each year, often at the behest of the governor’s administration.
But even though Caballero is the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and regularly works with the governor’s team, Gov. Gavin Newsom still vetoed seven of her bills this year, the most of any lawmaker.
“I do tough bills,” Caballero, a Democrat who represents the Merced area, told CalMatters. “So sometimes I get lucky, and other times, it’s disappointing. And, you know, you learn to live with it.”
Her vetoed bills include one that aimed to reduce emissions at state ports, another that sought to add oversight for metal shredding facilities and one that sought to train police to investigate foreign governments that target immigrant communities.
In his veto messages, Newsom described those bills as unnecessary since state agencies were already doing similar work. That’s one of the more common themes in Newsom’s 123 vetoes from this legislative session that he finished signing earlier this month. He used the word “duplicative” 16 times, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. 
The analysis highlights how Newsom uses his veto pen to assert authority over a Legislature his fellow Democrats control while rejecting bills he deems too costly, redundant or politically risky.  Newsom cited fiscal implications dozens of times in his veto messages, reflecting the challenges of a tough budget year. This year’s vetoes also gave him a chance to throw some shade at Newsom’s biggest enemy: President Donald Trump. 
Newsom mentioned Trump by name three times in his vetoes, and he cited Trump’s “hostile economic policies” in almost a quarter of his veto messages, 28 times. 
“With significant fiscal pressures and the federal government’s hostile economic policies, it is vital that we remain disciplined when considering bills with significant fiscal implications that are not included in the budget, such as this measure,” Newsom wrote, in vetoing Caballero’s bill that sought to exempt hydrogen fuel from sales taxes.
He used a nearly identical line to veto three other Caballero bills, including a measure to provide tax credits for medical equipment, a bill that would have provided grants for carbon dioxide removal and another that sought to incentivize biomass power plants. 
The vetoes represented just a small percentage of what Newsom’s did with the 917 bills that were sent to his desk this year. He vetoed just 13.4% of them, a slightly lower rate than previous years, according to Chris Micheli, an adjunct professor at McGeorge School of Law and a veteran lobbyist who keeps detailed statistics on the Legislature. 
It certainly wasn’t all vetoes for Caballero. Newsom also signed 10 of her bills into law. 
Zombie bills return for a second veto
There was another theme in Newsom’s vetoes: Spiking bills he’d previously vetoed.
He did that six times.
As CalMatters reported, even if a bill gets vetoed one year, lawmakers often bring the legislation back again — often with wording identical to the previous version. 
Previously vetoed measures are especially likely to be resurrected if well-funded lobbying groups that donate heavily to politicians are pushing for a new law. 
That was the case with two bills Newsom axed for the second time this year.
One was a union-backed bill by Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo that sought to make it easier for farmworkers to win workers’ compensation claims against employers for heat-related illnesses. The other was a previously vetoed measure by Democratic Assemblymember Esmerlda Soria of Merced that sought to allow community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees in nursing. Nurses unions, hospitals and community colleges supported the bill.
Newsom noted those bills were “nearly identical” to measures he previously killed, and he cited the same reasons. 
Newsom again spiked a bill that would require counties to create multidisciplinary behavioral health teams, a proposal to force insurers to pay for menopause treatment, a reparations bill and a measure to fund a study on women veterans’ mental health.
First-year lawmaker Democratic Assemblymember John Harabedian, representing the Pasadena area, had five vetoes this year, the second most in the Legislature. They were mostly related to health insurance and the fallout from last winter’s devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County.

Newsom vetoed his bill that would have required insurers to pay for up to 12 mental health visits for people living where there has been a recent wildfire. Another would have created a state-led disaster housing task force in Los Angeles County. The governor also vetoed a measure that sought to speed up patients getting the care their doctors recommended.
“Big, transformative policies often take multiple attempts, and I’m proud to keep pushing forward to serve my constituents,” Harabedian said in an emailed statement. 
Newsom signed four of Harabedian’s bills. 
None of Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra’s bills were vetoed this year  — for the first time in the San Jose lawmaker’s nine-year legislative career. He had 12 signed into law.
That included a bill aiming to prevent foreign labor contractors from exploiting their workers that was similar to a measure Newsom vetoed before. Kalra said he narrowed the bill to cover only farmworkers to address Newsom’s concerns. 
“You have to be persistent,” he said. “Sometimes it takes three, four or five times, or in the case of the foreign labor contractor bill, seven years.”

How other lawmakers avoid vetoes
Other lawmakers also got a lot of their bills past Newsom’s veto pen. 
Democratic Santa Ana Sen. Tom Umberg had Newsom sign 16 of his bills, the most behind San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, who had 21. As the Senate Budget Committee chair,  Wiener is the lead author of mandatory budget bills that skew his totals. 
Umberg’s bills include one prohibiting streaming providers such as Netflix from playing overly loud advertisements; another to prohibit Elon Musk and others from hosting lotteries to gin up partisan voter registration, one intended to stop puppy mills and an audit of the state’s troubled bar exam.
Umberg, a former federal prosecutor and attorney nearing the end of his term, said his success is due in part to him serving in the Legislature off and on since the 1990s. He’s served under four different governors, so he said he knows what they’re looking for.
“I hope that my years of experience provide some benefit and some expertise in legislating and how to work a bill through the process and how to get a bill signed,” he said.
Newsom vetoed one of Umberg’s bills this year, a measure that would have added new price-gouging protections and penalties in disaster zones. Newsom didn’t like that the bill also would have allowed the Legislature to override a governor’s authority on disaster declarations. 
Republicans are vastly outnumbered in the Legislature and not as many of their bills even reach the governor’s desk, so it stands out that Assemblymember Josh Hoover, a Republican representing the Folsom area, had the most bills signed among GOP lawmakers, with nine. Hoover is out of the country this week and wasn’t available for an interview, his spokesperson said. 
Republican Assemblymember Laurie Davies had seven of her bills signed, the third-most among Republicans.

Davies’ bills weren’t particularly controversial and didn’t involve partisan politics. They included a measure that requires schools to provide educational materials to prevent drownings. Another requires the state to tell those who file complaints about a drug and alcohol treatment center the outcome of their complaint. Another of her proposals prohibits selling equipment to modify electric bicycles so they no longer classify as an e-bike. 
Davies, who represents a competitive swing district in the Oceanside area, said she wants her bills to solve problems, not take partisan hits that almost certainly won’t get signed into law under a Democratic administration.
“We don’t run bills for social media clicks or cable news invites,” she said.Newsom did veto one of her bills this year, a measure that sought to make battery storage plants beef up their fire safety plans. Davies opposes a proposed battery storage facility in her district.
Newsom’s veto message used one of his favorite words: “Duplicative.”
“This bill is largely duplicative of existing requirements and mandates a new procedural requirement that risks delaying critical clean energy projects,” he wrote.

Others touch on current crises. And the Legislature’s action or inaction is often a factor.","During the first full week of most months from September through May, the Supreme Judicial Court is open for arguments. Between a handful of first degree murder appeals, the seven justices consider some cases that have slowly wound their way up from the lower courts, plus a few that present important questions of constitutional law that call for clarity from the state’s high court before sending them back down for trial or judgement. 
In November, the justices will wrestle with some disputes that are years or decades in the making. Others touch on current crises. And the Legislature’s action or inaction is often a factor.  
Here’s a preview of four cases that could have wide-ranging effects, set for oral arguments before the SJC next month.  

Charter school public records fight – November 3 
A years-long legal dispute between Attorney General Andrea Campbell and the high-performing but controversial Mystic Valley Regional Charter School is hitting the high court. The Malden-based charter received at least 10 public records requests between January and November 2022 from the Malden News Network, Commonwealth Transparency, and mayoral candidate Lissette Alvarado. 
They requested information including corporate statements, contracts, ledgers, lease records, conflict of interest disclosures filed by board members, payments made to employees or professional services, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Mystic Valley rebuffed each request, claiming that “as a Commonwealth charter school, it does not fall under the category of entities handling public documents” and is not subject to the state public records law. 
After the Supervisor of Records issued multiple orders for the school to comply with the record requests, Campbell’s office filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court in July 2023. The Superior Court sided with the AG’s office, declaring the school to be a government entity subject to the public records law. Mystic Valley appealed, arguing that the suit fundamentally misunderstood the nature of charter schools.  
Mystic Valley has faced controversy before, including criticism over a dress code policy banning hair extensions that disproportionately affected Black students, which led to passage of state legislation declaring such practices discriminatory. 
In this case, the school argues that charters are more like business entities, granted “significant independence” without strong enough ties to the state to make them government entities subject to public records laws.  
“The Legislature intended for charter school (sic) to chart their own course, with the freedom to experiment and test out new ways of teaching children,” the school wrote in its brief to the high court. “With these goals in mind, it is logical to treat charter schools more like private, independent organizations than governmental entities. 
But the AG’s office says the school “can only exist and operate” if the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education allows it and continues to renew its charter, as it did in 2023, and clearly performs the “government function” of educating the Commonwealth’s young people as a public school. 
Whistleblower retaliation suit drags on – November 3 
Thomas Galvin’s wrongful termination lawsuit against Roxbury Community College is now before the SJC, more than a decade after the former security chief was fired. 
Galvin served as the college’s director of facilities and public safety from 2007 until his August 2012 termination. In a lawsuit filed in Middlesex Superior Court, he claimed he was fired as retaliation for exposing the college’s failure to report sexual assault allegations as required under the federal Clery Act. He is the brother of Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin.  
In 2010, Galvin received a letter from a student alleging she had been sexually violated by two former professors and had previously reported the incidents to college administrators. When Galvin pressed college officials about whether the complaints had been properly reported under the Clery Act, he alleges Vice President of Administration and Finance Alane Shanks told him there was nothing to report and accused him of trying to get her in trouble. 
Galvin reported what he believed to be the college’s Clery Act failures to state auditors and federal authorities in 2011. The college fired him the next year, citing security and performance concerns raised in an internal audit, including issues with Galvin’s Clery Act reporting.  
The Superior Court, considering Gavin’s claim that he was protected by the state’s whistleblower statute, rejected the college’s argument that Galvin had to prove he acted in good faith and agreed with Galvin that he engaged in protected activity. The high court will hear arguments on whether the lower court correctly found that Galvin was a whistleblower under state law. 
If lawmakers won’t raise attorney wages, can the courts? – November 5 
The bar advocate work stoppage will finally reach the full Supreme Judicial Court, which is being asked to consider whether it has the constitutional authority to raise court-appointed attorney pay rates. 
Most bar advocates, private attorneys who handle roughly 80 percent of indigent criminal defense cases in Massachusetts, stopped work in Suffolk and Middlesex county courts in June 2025, demanding higher hourly rates. Bar advocates in Massachusetts make $65 an hour, while advocates in other New England states make more than $100 an hour. The work stoppage overwhelmed the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state’s major public defender organization. 
The Committee for Public Counsel Services is arguing that the Legislature, which rolled out a deal in late July that would raise the hourly wages $10 per year over the next two years, is shirking its responsibility to make sure that people without means still have access to counsel. Since July, more than 180 people in custody for more than a week without counsel and over 800 without representation for 45 days have been released or had charges dismissed because of the lag in finding attorneys to defend them.  
A lower court judge ordered that attorneys for five defendants be paid $100 an hour, and CPCS was able to find representation for those defendants at that rate. The question before the high court, now, is whether judges have the authority to raise rates to make sure that courts function correctly. Justice Dalila Wendlandt denied a request to raise bar advocate wages on July 3, and the matter now makes it up to the full court.
“Once again, indigent criminal defendants find themselves in an unacceptable and constitutionally intolerable position – without counsel” because of low compensation set by lawmakers, CPCS notes in its brief. The Suffolk County district attorney’s office argues that allowing judges to overrule that statutory wage, however, takes the “serious constitutional failure” and “turns it into a moral demand for judicial intervention, impermissibly blurring the line between enforcing constitutional rights and assuming the powers of the Legislature.” 
$1 billion tobacco verdict under review – November 5 
Philip Morris wants a new trial for a case that involves the largest ever jury award in the history of Massachusetts – in which a Middlesex County Superior Court jury handed down $8 million in compensatory damages and $1 billion in punitive damages – for the 2017 lung cancer death of Barbara Fontaine. 
After three-weeks of proceedings in late 2022, the jury found Philip Morris liable for Fontaine’s death at 60 years old, after 40 years of smoking Phillip Morris cigarettes. But the tobacco company argues among other things that the scale of punitive damages, which the judge reduced to just over $56 million, was constitutionally excessive and demonstrated that the jury was motivated by passion and prejudice. 
“The award is unprecedented from just about any perspective,” Philip Morris argues in its court filing. Focusing on this case, it added, “there was no justification for an award 125 times the $8 million compensatory award.” If an award is so exaggerated that it indicates a jury could be acting from a place of bias or prejudice, just reducing the amount is not enough to make the proceedings fair, the company asserts. 
Fontaine’s estate argues that the trial court judge concluded the award came after the highly educated jury listened attentively to weeks of testimony and asked thoughtful questions. It also argues that the verdict considered what it would take to deter such behavior given the company’s enormous wealth. Philip Morris’s “generational campaign to deceive and create fatally addicted addicts out of Americans worked,” the filing notes. “Preventing similar future conduct would save millions of lives.” 
Other massive punitive awards were reduced but did not lead to a new trial, like a $3 billion award in a 2005 California suit against Philip Morris, which was reduced to $50 million, the estate adds. 
Along with whether the company is entitled to a new trial, the court will consider whether trial judges generally should impose safeguards to avoid excessive damages, and whether the jury should have been told about federal law stating that cigarette labeling is considerate adequate to warn consumers about the risks of smoking.

But with more financial troubles looming, lawmakers say there’s more work to be done to protect reproductive health services.","In summary
An injection of public funding means the nonprofit organization can keep primary care clinics operating. But with more financial troubles looming, lawmakers say there’s more work to be done to protect reproductive health services. 


After months of financial strain, Planned Parenthood will get a $140 million lifeline to offset losses it sustained after Congress in July cut funding for the health system, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.
The money will help Planned Parenthood keep 109 California clinics open. In a statement, Newsom said the move reflects the state’s continued commitment to abortion and reproductive health care.
“Trump’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers,” Newsom said.
Lawmakers will also take up the issue in January when the Legislature reconvenes.
The news comes a week after the nonprofit organization announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Five other clinics also closed in July in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, all in response to federal defunding.
Planned Parenthood needs roughly $27 million monthly to operate all of its local facilities, according to Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, the organization’s statewide advocacy group.
“We’re incredibly grateful that we’ve found a way to get some funding out to our Planned Parenthood health centers so they can remain operating and continue services,” Hicks said. 
California is the fourth state, following Washington, Colorado and New Mexico, to pledge public funds to keep Planned Parenthood afloat. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering similar moves.
Republicans have lambasted and targeted Planned Parenthood for decades over contraceptive and abortion services. A 1977 law banned federal funding for abortions, but this summer President Donald Trump took additional steps to cut down the nation’s largest abortion provider.
His sweeping tax and budget bill prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid dollars for any kinds of services, including mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.
According to Planned Parenthood, abortions account for less than 10% of its services, while other reproductive health services make up the bulk of medical care provided.
Federal funding losses have forced Planned Parenthood to close clinics across the country, where half of all patients rely on Medicaid. In California, where 80% of Planned Parenthood patients have Medicaid – known as Medi-Cal in the state – the losses are even greater.
“There was definitely an outsized impact on California,” Hicks said.
Primary care closures ripple across the state
Democratic lawmakers, Newsom and Planned Parenthood have spent most of the year searching for a funding solution that protects reproductive health access without cash from federal coffers. But, faced with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, solutions have been slow to appear and challenging to maintain.
“We’ll fight like hell to maintain access to care in the coming months and years,” said Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat who leads the Legislative Women’s Caucus,
Even with the state’s pledge to protect sexual and reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood clinics face growing uncertainty driven by federal grant freezes, lawsuits and even some proposed state cuts.
Last week, Planned Parenthood in Orange and San Bernardino counties announced facilities would close primary care services on Dec. 13. The group, which runs nine health centers, added primary care more than a decade ago to serve low-income patients unable to find appointments elsewhere. 
Dr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, said the federal actions are “destroying our primary care program.” She said she worries patients with urgent mental health needs or chronic conditions won’t be able to quickly find another provider. Many communities in the region have too few doctors, according to state data.
Roughly 13,000 patients will lose access to care and Planned Parenthood will lay off 77 staff.
“It’s inhumane to take away people’s health care,” Jacobson said. “Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.”
Aguiar-Curry called the loss of primary care “unacceptable and dangerous.” 
Seeking stability as ‘financial cliff’ still looms
Farther north, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte — which runs 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada — closed five health centers in July shortly after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood’s funding.
Mar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization has been working to maintain its financial stability. The closures helped preserve services at the organization’s other clinics until the end of the year, but Adams warned that it could hit a “financial cliff” in January. 
“We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,” Adams said. “What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.”
Other Planned Parenthood groups in the state are exploring ways to cut costs and boost revenue while keeping clinics open for patients.
Dr. Neda Ashtari, a former Planned Parenthood and Medi-Cal patient, emphasized the importance of ensuring more than 1 million patients continue to have access to cancer screenings and other reproductive health services. When Ashtari was a teenager, her mother died of breast cancer after missing routine scans that could have detected the cancer earlier, she said.
“It really crystallizes that this preventative care is the difference between life or death,” Ashtari said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last summer, on his way to the Rich County rodeo, Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz stopped at a gas station in Evanston, Wyoming. Taking the out-of-state route allowed him to do two things — to buy a couple of lottery tickets, which are banned in Utah, and fill up his gas tank while saving 26 cents per gallon.
The gas price disparity across state lines had been on his mind before then, he said in a social media post in August, where he hinted at a legislative proposal to help find a relief. 
“A big reason is that Utah refineries produce up to 220,000 barrels a day, but about 75,000 of those are shipped out of state to meet demand elsewhere in the West—pushing our prices higher here at home,” Schultz wrote then. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A few months have passed since that post, and more details about the plan Schultz has worked on alongside Rep. Cal Roberts, R-Draper, and Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Highland, have emerged. It has to do with a longstanding tax practice for fuel exported out of state.
Currently, Utah has a $0.385 tax rate per gallon for motor fuel sold at gas pumps in the state, but has an exemption for fuel exported out of state.
A draft bill is still in the works, Roberts said, and may be introduced during the 2026 legislative session to, essentially, reassess the state’s gas tax structure.
“The idea would be, we’re going to remove that tax exemption, that special tax break that they get for (the) product that leaves the state, and we’re going to tax all fuel the same,” Roberts said. “And then by doing that, we’re going to be able to lower the gas tax for Utahns at the pump.”
How so? 
By also lowering that $0.385 tax rate that Utahns pay for fuel.
Removing the tax exemption would have an impact on Utah refineries’ ability to export their product out of state, Roberts said. “But you’re going to create enough revenue where you can drop the gas tax for Utahns in the state. And I think we’re looking at dropping the gas tax 25% to 50%.” 
That would translate to a price reduction of 10 to 20 cents per gallon, he added.
Since the bill language isn’t yet public, the Utah Petroleum Association didn’t have much to say about its position; however, Rikki Hrenko-Browning, president of the group, said in a prepared statement that “altering the state’s gas tax and other related taxes will have significant financial implications for the state of Utah. Until we have bill language that clearly lays out what the legislature wants to do, we won’t speculate on what the exact nature of those impacts will be.”
The association remains committed to conversations with lawmakers to share potential impacts on any proposals they may pursue, she added.
Regional pricing
According to the American Automobile Association, as of Thursday, the average gas price in Utah was $3.31 a gallon, over the $3.07 national average. 
In neighboring Wyoming, that’s normally cheaper with an average of $2.97 per gallon reported Thursday. Meanwhile, Colorado saw a $2.93 average. However, other surrounding states had higher gas prices on the same day. Idaho reported an average of $3.42 a gallon; Nevada had $3.80 and Arizona, $3.36. 
Roberts pointed to rural bordering counties, like San Juan in southeastern Utah, which had a $3.49 average per gallon on Thursday, while Montezuma in southwestern Colorado reported an average of $2.95.



Let us know what you think...


 


He argued that while Utah produces more gas than it consumes, prices aren’t competitive because of regional market influences. 
As other Western states like California move away from fossil fuels, leading refineries to shut down, Utah’s oil production grew 13% to 65.1 million barrels in 2024, the highest annual production on record, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
“When supply goes down, or supply is not as much, what happens to price? Price goes up,” Roberts said. “And those higher prices in Nevada, California, Washington, Oregon, they’ve had a vacuum effect, where they’ve sucked barrels out of our state, because our refineries are chasing the higher margins of these other states, and it’s increasing our prices.”
Industry pushback 
An anonymous petition is circulating online opposing the proposal, arguing that “there’s no proof this would actually lower prices for Utah drivers—but it would create new costs and red tape for the energy producers who power our state.”
The refining industry, the petition says, is already dealing with global instability, market pressures and other regulatory burdens. “The last thing we need is more government interference in an industry that keeps Utah running,” petitioners wrote. 
Schultz responded to that request with an eye-rolling emoji, saying the legislative proposal would shift the tax burden off Utahns and onto oil refiners.
“These are some of the largest companies in Utah, and the world, and they’ve fought for decades to avoid paying their fair share, all while Utah families face some of the highest gas prices in the country,” Schultz wrote in a post.
Roberts is on the same page.
While he’s happy the refineries are doing well and help keep prices relatively low, he believes they get a lot of tax breaks that are paid by Utahns.
“We think it’s fair to Utahns to re-examine those tax breaks and those tax exemptions that these guys are enjoying,” Roberts said, “and then using some of that to lower the gas tax at the pump for Utahns.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) on Thursday called lawmakers back to Richmond for a special session Monday afternoon, setting off speculation that Democrats are preparing to act on redistricting plans just days before voters elect a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 members of the House of Delegates.
In a letter to legislators, Scott cited constitutional provisions and joint resolutions authorizing the General Assembly to reconvene the 2024 Special Session I “to consider matters properly before the ongoing session and any related business laid before the body.”
The House will meet at 4 p.m. Monday in the Capitol chamber, he wrote, adding that the clerk’s office will soon provide logistical details.
“My office has spoken with Senate leadership and has been assured that a similar communication … will be made by the Senate Clerk’s Office to Senate members,” Scott wrote.
He did not explain why the legislature is being recalled, and neither he nor Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) responded to inquiries from The Mercury on Thursday.
Redistricting speculation
Several Democrats and legislative staffers told Virginia Scope that part of the session’s focus will be redistricting — a move that could reopen debate over how Virginia’s 11 congressional boundaries are drawn. Six of these are currently held by Democrats, and sources told the outlet that Democrats in Washington believe a new map could yield at least two additional Democratic-leaning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Maryland senator introduces bill to redraw congressional districts in response to Texas

Virginia voters in 2020 approved a constitutional amendment creating an independent redistricting commission of lawmakers and citizens, but the panel deadlocked in late 2021, leaving the Virginia Supreme Court to draw the current maps.
With Democrats now holding narrow control of both legislative chambers, some strategists have discussed using their majorities to revisit that framework.
Options under discussion include breaking up heavily Democratic districts to make them more competitive while reshaping Republican-leaning areas to favor Democratic candidates.
Timing is key — under Virginia’s amendment process, a constitutional change must be approved twice by the General Assembly with a House election in between before being placed on the ballot for voter approval or rejection.
According to Virginia Scope, Democratic leaders are considering an initial vote before the Nov. 4 election, followed by a second vote during the 2026 session, potentially allowing a referendum next spring and new maps no sooner than April — two months before congressional primaries.
Still, many Democratic lawmakers remain uneasy about the plan. Senate Democrats held a caucus meeting Wednesday night, and several members told the outlet they had been “kept out of the loop” about the special-session agenda.
National backdrop
Across the country, redistricting battles are intensifying as both parties look to lock in advantages ahead of the 2026 midterms.
Earlier on Thursday, the New York Times reported that Virginia’s Democratic leaders are considering “joining a growing number of states” seeking to counter what they call partisan gerrymandering efforts encouraged by the administration of President Donald Trump.
“We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” Surovell told the Times, suggesting Democrats view their move as a corrective to Republican-led redistricting maneuvers in states such as Texas, Florida and North Carolina.
Those states have recently pushed new maps designed to cement GOP control after a series of federal court rulings loosened constraints on mid-decade remapping. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana, another sign of how important the issue is to legislators and voters nationwide.

In August, Sen. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth) hinted publicly that Virginia could soon act. Sharing a post by former President Barack Obama on X, formerly Twitter, that praised California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approach to mid-decade redistricting, Lucas wrote: “Every state in the nation should follow suit. Stay tuned for Virginia …”
Political fallout
Republicans swiftly accused Democrats of scheming to rewrite the rules ahead of a pivotal statewide election.
Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, in a video on X characterized Scott’s move a sign of Democratic desperation.
“Desperate Democrats are pulling a pathetic, political stunt,” Peake said, accusing the majority of “doing anything they can to take attention away from their horrible candidates.”
He added that “the General Assembly hopes they can do something with this ruse about redistricting,” but urged voters not to “fall for it.”
The campaign of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, blamed Democratic contender Abigail Spanberger for supporting the idea of dissolving the independent commission.
“In a stunning display of arrogance, Abigail Spanberger wants to overrule the will of Virginia voters in favor of a cynical power grab,” campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement Thursday.
“She came out in favor of abolishing Virginia’s Independent Redistricting Commission and wants to hand control back to the politicians in Richmond so they can guarantee their own reelection. … It’s never been about the voters or what’s best for Virginia. It’s always been about what’s best for Abigail Spanberger,” the statement said.
Civil rights groups vow challenge to North Carolina’s new congressional maps

In an interview with WJLA in late August, however, Spanberger said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
And Democrats countered that they’re simply responding to an escalating nationwide power struggle over fair representation.
In a statement Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Courtney Rice said “House Republicans know they are poised to lose the majority because the public is souring on their failed agenda.”
She accused Republicans of “rigging the midterms by ramming through new, unpopular, gerrymandered maps across the country.” Rice added that Virginia’s move to reconvene and “preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” praising state Democrats for “standing up against Republican attempts to weaken the power, and vote, of the people.”
What comes next
With the state legislature reconvening Monday afternoon, both chambers are expected to gavel in briefly before potentially taking up redistricting-related measures later in the week.
Procedural resolutions adopted earlier this year would allow lawmakers to address “matters properly before the ongoing special session,” giving Scott wide latitude to add topics to the agenda.
Any move to alter Virginia’s redistricting process would likely trigger intense legal scrutiny and political backlash — especially given the proximity to Election Day. But Democratic strategists across the country argue that Republican-led states have already rewritten maps to their advantage.

,California,2025-10-24 12:04:00+00:00,CalMatters,Should billionaires pay more? California unions want voters to decide,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/billionaire-tax-initiative/,Labor and health care groups are collecting signatures to put a measure that would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of about 200 billionaires in California.,"In summary
Labor and health care groups are collecting signatures to put a measure that would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of about 200 billionaires in California. 


For years, Gov. Gavin Newsom has staunchly opposed increasing taxes on wealthy Californians even when the issue repeatedly reared its head during recent tough budget years. But faced with deep federal cuts to social services programs, labor and health care groups are asking voters to circumvent the governor – to tax a very small number of people.
Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West and St. John’s Community Health in Los Angeles want voters statewide to approve a “billionaires tax” to help prop up the state’s health care and education systems. 
The proposed ballot initiative would levy a one-time, 5% tax on the approximately 200 billionaires in the state, generating roughly $100 billion in revenue, according to proponents. 
Going to the ballot is a common move for advocacy groups frustrated with Sacramento politics, which, while dominated by Democrats, can still be factious. Dave Regan, president of SEIU-UHW, said at a news conference the ballot initiative is the “only solution anyone can see.” 
“We are facing literally a collapse of our health care system here in California and elsewhere,” Regan said. “This will help us keep health care facilities open. It will stabilize premiums and coverage for all Californians, protect health care jobs, and also improve public education.”
The proposed initiative would tax the 2025 net worth of billionaires residing in California, allowing them to pay off the obligation over five years. The revenue would go into a special fund with 90% reserved for health care spending and 10% reserved for K-12 education spending.
It needs 874,641 signatures to be placed before voters on the 2026 ballot, a number that the groups are confident they can reach. Getting voters to ultimately approve the tax, however, could be a hard sell.
While California has taxed the income of millionaires, lawmakers have never successfully passed a wealth tax. Instead of targeting earnings, the state would levy such a tax on the net worth of an individual, everything from investments to property value and even other assets, like jewelry and paintings. 
The governor is a big reason why. Newsom has never supported a wealth tax, at times angrily rejecting conservative efforts to link him with one as “shameful.” He quashed the most recent legislative effort last year. 
Democratic lawmakers this year had considered raising revenue to help support the state’s social services programs, which receive billions in federal funds annually, but pivoted to focus on Newsom’s Proposition 50 redistricting fight.
Regan said there are no plans to cut a deal with state lawmakers and pull the initiative from the ballot.
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax reform and budget bill — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — is projected to cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over a decade. California is estimated to lose roughly $30 billion in federal Medicaid funds annually as a result. The state’s Medicaid agency estimates 3.4 million people will lose coverage as a result of federal eligibility changes.
The bulk of cuts won’t take effect until 2027. But states, including California, are already taking steps to shrink their health insurance programs for low-income and disabled individuals. 
California lawmakers facing a $12 billion deficit earlier this year made cuts to the state’s insurance program for immigrants without legal status, including a partial enrollment freeze that starts Jan. 1. They also reinstituted the Medi-Cal asset test, which limits how much enrollees can have in property value and savings.
Susan Shelley, vice president of communications with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said most Californians will probably assume that the tax will not affect them, but establishing a wealth tax in the state could create a troubling precedent. 
“We tax income at a very high level, but we don’t tax wealth and assets,” Shelley said. Nearly half of the state’s personal income tax revenue comes from just 1% of the state’s earners. Over time, she added, a wealth tax “could come all the way down to the middle class and they say you have too much equity in your house and we’re taking it.” 
Shelley also said the proposed initiative would incentivize billionaires to leave the state, creating a “huge hole in the state budget” that would hurt the economy in the long term. 
Proponents of the measure disagreed with that characterization of the proposal. They said that it would not levy taxes on the middle class nor would it affect businesses because it targets the net worth of ultrawealthy individuals. 
Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at UC Berkeley and supporter of the proposal, said the tax is structured to prevent billionaires from avoiding the bill simply by leaving the state.
It would tax their wealth established in 2025, and any billionaires who moved to the state in 2026 would not be subject to the levy.
“California billionaires are not going to be able to avoid the tax by moving their assets outside of California,” Saez said.

,California,2025-10-24 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s gerrymander and generational rift could shake up its Democratic hierarchy,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-gerrymander-democratic-hierarchy/,"If Prop 50 succeeds, Democrats' votes will be spread more thinly to five more congressional districts at the same time younger candidates challenge senior-age incumbents.","Democratic politicians throughout California — those already in office and those who want in — assume that voters will rearrange the state’s 52 congressional districts next month and create new career opportunities.
The assumption is well grounded. A recent CBS News poll found 62% of the state’s likely voters, driven by disdain for President Donald Trump, will enact Proposition 50, a plan to shift five more congressional seats to Democrats even though they already have 43.
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander would offset pro-Republican redistricting schemes in Texas and other states that Trump seeks to retain, or perhaps expand, the GOP’s paper-thin majority in the House next year.
With Prop. 50 seemingly a slam-dunk, current Democratic congressional members and wannabes are trying to sort out who will run for what — no small feat. To create the new seats, the Democrats’ political cartographers have to spread the party’s 10.4 million voters more thinly, reducing its margins in districts it already holds.
California also is not immune to the Democrats’ generational conflict, in the wake of their loss to Trump last year after an aged and obviously impaired President Joe Biden dropped out.
Politico declares that “fully half of the state’s older House Democrats are set to face same-party challengers next year…”
The most interesting example is in San Francisco, where 85-year-old Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who has held her congressional seat for nearly 40 years, has already drawn two primary opponents even though she hasn’t announced whether she’ll run again.
First in was 39-year-old Saikat Chakrabarti, a former campaign aide and staffer to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, typifying the young progressives who have chafed at their party’s geriatric leadership.
His candidacy forced the issue for state Sen. Scott Wiener, who at 55 is no spring chicken. He has been waiting patiently for years for Pelosi to retire.  Wiener declared his candidacy this week, telling the New York Times, “The world changes. I made a decision that it makes sense for me to get into the race now because I’m passionate about San Francisco having the best possible representation.”
Pelosi won’t announce her intentions until after Prop. 50 is decided. But if she does retire, she likely wants to choose her successor — which is how she got her congressional seat in 1987.
San Francisco politics have a long history of control by a few powerful factions, most prominently one created in the 1950s by Willie Brown, brothers Phillip and John Burton and George Moscone.
The Burtons both served in Congress. John Burton was a long-time legislative leader and Moscone, then the city’s mayor, was assassinated in 1978.
Brown, now 91 and the only one of them still alive, wields massive influence in the city, after being the longest-tenured Assembly speaker and winning two terms as mayor. He was instrumental in the careers of  Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Pelosi, born into a powerful political family in Baltimore, continued the family business in 1963 after marrying Paul Pelosi, scion of an influential San Francisco family, and moving to his city.
She integrated into the Brown-Burton-Moscone organization. When Phillip Burton died in 1983, his widow, Sala, took over his congressional seat and then, before dying in 1987, designated Pelosi as her successor.
San Francisco media have speculated that if Pelosi steps down, she might favor Connie Chan, a city supervisor, as her successor, noting that Chan was the only local official to speak alongside Pelosi at a recent Prop. 50 rally.

Nevada is 1 of 24 states that doesn’t dedicate funding in its state budget for after-school or summer programs, meaning organizations rely on precarious federal funding and finite philanthropic dollars. 
Children’s advocacy groups and after school networks, which see the benefits of after-school programs such as increasing literacy rates and reducing chronic absenteeism, have often discussed internally how state funding would make after-school programs available to more Nevada children.
“We could impact thousands of more students with appropriated money through the state Legislature,” said Jodi Manzella, the executive director of Southern Nevada based After-School All-Stars Las Vegas.
Nevada is routinely at or near the bottom of lists gauging education outcomes and achievement, while also seeing a surge in chronic absenteeism and other conditions which hinder student performance.
After-school programs in the state, as well as across the country, have shown to fill the gaps and increase literacy rates or math scores through tutoring and other educational programing, said Kendra Gipson with Nevada Afterschool Network Youth 
”Youth who attend after-school programs are more likely to graduate high school,” Gipson said. “Youth that attend after school programs don’t struggle with absenteeism, like their peers.”
Manzella said there have been schools that saw 30% chronic absenteeism before After-School All-Stars began offering programs that have seen rates cut in half. 
The principals at those schools say they “can directly tie some of that result to the students that are in All- Stars.”
”They come to school every day because they want to be there” for the program, Manzella said. “Testing scores will increase for the kids that are in All-Stars because they get 300 additional contact hours with educators throughout the year.”
These programs also become a “lifeline” for students who might not have access to other extracurricular activities or tutoring programs, and also decrease involvement in the justice system, said Annette Dawson Owens with the Children’s Advocacy Alliance of Nevada.
“The return on investment has shown that it’s much easier to invest in students on the front end than to do some of those costly expenses on the back end,” Dawson Owens said. 
Child care in the state is also among the most expensive, which can hinder working parents.  More, and free, after school programs “means that those parents can also go to work,” Gipson said. 
Afterschool Alliance released its “America After 3 p.m.” report this month that found 29.6 million families want afterschool programs but just 7 million children are enrolled.
Roughly 65,000 children in Nevada are in after-school programs, but nearly 229,000 would participate in programs if available, according to the report. 
In a survey of 415 households in Nevada asking what barriers prevented them from after school programs, nearly half said there wasn’t a program in their community, 60% said programs are too expensive, and 60% said they lacked a safe way to get to and from programs. 
Though After-School All-Stars, one of the many programs in the state, has expanded to 21 schools in Southern Nevada and serves about 2,000 students every day, it’s obviously far from enough, Manzella said.
“We know that there are many more students out there that need support,” Manzella said. “We have waiting lists for students that would like to participate with us, and our barrier is funding.”
The Schwarzenegger of it all
President Donald Trump announced over the summer his administration would withhold $6 billion in funding nationwide for after-school and summer programs, worrying many Nevada organizations that provide resources. Nevada was at risk of losing about $60 million.  
“If those dollars were zeroed out, like they said they were going to be, then programs would have closed,” said Gipson, adding an estimated 11,000 students across the state “would not have been able to attend a program because of those dollars.”
After bipartisan backlash against Trump withholding the money, the administration changed course and released the funding.
The federal funding for the next fiscal cycle isn’t expected to change, Gipson said.
“We are always trying to advocate for an increase because of the students that are still waiting to enroll” in these after-school programs,” she added. 
After-school programs, whether administered by nonprofits or through city-run programs, rely on federal funding and philanthropic dollars to survive in Nevada. The current funding sources not only mean thousands of children can’t access these programs, but funding streams for those programs that are accessible are unstable. 
Federal grant dollars are competitive and usually organizations are competing for the same pot of money, Gipson said. 
Like many other states, Nevada used funds provided by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enacted during the Biden administration to expand and enhance existing programs. But those dollars only provided short-term assistance. 
“Many nonprofits, and not just ours, are feeling the effects of that covid funding going away.” Manzella said.
With tourism revenue down and the state experiencing economic uncertainty, “corporations here in Nevada, when their earnings are down and their revenue is down, they’re not able to give as much in turn,” she said
Afterschool Alliance found that “state-level funding for afterschool and summer learning programs has increased twenty fold since 2000, with 26 states now collectively providing more than $5 billion in funding for local programs.”
While there have been policy discussions within organizations that comprise an after school network, Gipson was unsure what larger policy discussions are happening with state lawmakers about providing a dedicated funding as is found in half the other states in the country. 
Manzella and Gipson pointed to states like California, which passed a ballot initiative in 2002 to fund after-school programs. The reason it was successful was because former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger championed the efforts, they said. 
“We need a champion or two in this state that realizes the impact of after school, wants every child to have the opportunity to do that, and starts looking at legislation to get a state item in our budget,” Gipson said. 
Neither Gipson nor Manzella knew of any estimate of the cost reducing the number of students waiting. 
At the After-School All-Stars, for example, it cost around $140,000 “to run a school for the full year for approximately 120 kids,” Manzella said. 
But not all after school programs are equal or offer the same types of programming, so costs will vary.
“Even starting off small would give the opportunity to more students that are on waiting lists,” Manzella said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6SzRhrow-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 08:16:31.953455

(Photos courtesy of candidates; graphic by Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Voters in Cullman County will go to the polls Tuesday to elect a new representative in the House District 12 special election.
Voters in the district, which covers part of Cullman County, will choose between GOP nominee Cindy Myrex and Democratic nominee Matt Glover. The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
The district is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. Multiple messages seeking comment from Myrex were left in the last week.
The candidates
Myrex, 58, campaigned on listening to constituents, improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth. Voters told Myrex they were concerned about a new state law that would allow the city of Cullman, a wet city, to annex land from Cullman County, a dry county, for a “community development project” to serve alcohol.

The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which cannot begin going through the lawmaking process until the Legislature returns in January. 
Glover, 41, said in an interview Friday that he is prioritizing eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. 
The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Glover said that expanding Medicaid has become a bigger priority for him since President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law in July. 
“Expanding Medicaid to try to offset the cuts that are coming from the federal bill to try to keep as many rural hospitals open as possible, and try to help with the independent doctors offices and pharmacies,” Glover said. 

Campaign finances

According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised over $157,000 and spent almost $153,000. Since Myrex was selected as the GOP nominee in August, she’s raised over $57,000. Over 62% of those funds have come from political action committees (PACs). During the primary, most of Myrex’s funds came from businesses and individuals.
According to campaign finance records, Glover has raised about $4,000 and spent about $3,500. Glover has gotten 180 donations, most of which are less than $20, from across the country.

How to vote

District 12 voters can choose between Myrex and Glover on Oct. 28. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. The winner will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives.

Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Frank Prezzato, 69, of St. Clair Shores was sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty in September to one count of voting absentee and in person, previously acknowledging that he acted recklessly in voting twice during the same election. 
“Voting twice undermines our democratic process,” Nessel said in a previous statement. “My office will continue to prosecute those who violate our voting laws to ensure Michigan voters have confidence in the integrity of our elections.”
According to the Department of Attorney General, Prezatto appeared in person to vote on Election Day after having previously submitted a ballot for the same election. He was among seven people charged in the St. Clair Shores’ double-voting case, although five others had their cases dismissed, four of which are being appealed by the AG’s office.
A seventh person, Stacey Kramer, 56, was bound over to circuit court where a trial is set for Feb. 3, 2026.
If Prezatto meets the terms of his probation, all charges will be dismissed with prejudice at the end of his probationary period. 
A delayed sentence review for Prezatto is scheduled for April 15, 2026, in the 16th Circuit Court in Macomb County.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The statue honoring Baron Johann Dekalb is looking a little different lately.
The 139-year old bronze statue on the south side of the State House grounds is missing the blade of Dekalb’s sword. Instead of looking like he’s leading troops into battle, the Revolutionary War hero, clasping just the sword handle, looks a bit like an old man shaking his fist at the sky.
Fear not.
The removal is part of regular conservation efforts rather than theft or vandalism of the monument.
“The statue was conserved in June of this year, and during that process, it was determined that the replacement sword blade on the statue needed to be removed due to condition issues,” Chris Kintzel, director of the Maryland Commission on Artistic Property, said in an email.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The statute receives conservation funding from the Maryland Military Monument Commission, and we work in conjunction with the Maryland Historical Trust/Maryland Department of Planning to arrange for its treatment, which is typically every two-three years,” Kintzel’s email said. “We are currently working with our partners to coordinate the installation of one of the replacement blades.”
Dekalb – or De Kalb as it is spelled on the monument and various reputable historical records — was a French general who fought with the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.
He served with Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge and was second in command under Horatio Gates in the Carolina campaign. Dekalb led troops from Maryland and Delaware during the battle of Camden in South Carolina. He was wounded multiple times during that battle and died days later as a result.
Ephraim Keyser, a Marylander considered to be a prominent sculptor in his time, was hired to create the monument. The Dekalb monument is considered a “significant example” of Keyser’s work, according to Maryland Historical Trust records.
The monument, dedicated in August 1886, cost 10,000 (more than $300,000 in 2025). Congress paid for the granite and bronze memorial, according to the Maryland Historical Trust.
The sword blade itself is removable. The one that was removed this summer during conservation work was not the original, Kintzel said.
The original blade was vandalized twice in 1990, according to the Maryland Historical Trust. Kintzel added that the blade was stolen that year.
That same year, five replacement blades made of fiberglass were made, according to Kintzel.

Launched by President Joe Biden’s administration in 2023, Welcome Corps allowed people in the United States to sponsor refugees.
“When it opened, all the Burmese, they were so excited,” she said. 
The group put money in a bank account for the expected refugee. Then in January, the program abruptly shut down. “We’re just waiting. That’s all we can do now,” Hlamyo said. 
Welcome Corps is just one facet of refugee resettlement in America that President Donald Trump changed dramatically when he began his second term Jan. 20. As part of a larger withdrawal from international humanitarian aid, Trump signed an executive order halting the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The State Department also ended funding to local resettlement nonprofits, though a lawsuit later restored some of that money. 
Across the country, nonprofits have closed their refugee resettlement programs or are looking for new funding sources, with many waiting to see if the pipeline will reopen. 
Following the federal Refugee Act of 1980, the U.S. built a formidable bureaucracy to resettle people who face persecution abroad. Federal agencies vet applicants, many of whom live in refugee camps scattered across the globe. Once approved, a network of nonprofits uses federal funds to help newly arrived refugees get on their feet. 
Trump’s re-election last year reflects a growing animosity among Western countries toward globalization. The president has denounced international institutions like the United Nations, which partners with the U.S. and other countries to resettle refugees. 
This year’s federal budget bill made refugees without a green card ineligible for benefits including the federal food assistance program. It also affected their eligibility for full Medicaid benefits and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Bonnie Gay of Princeton Alliance Church in New Jersey has seen the impact of refugees whose arrivals have been blocked.
 “Every story is one of trauma and loss,” said Gay, who leads the church’s Alliance for Refugees. “They come seeking safety and a fresh start where they can put down roots in a place of welcome and peace.”
 No money for the American Dream

Some nonprofits ended their refugee resettlement programs entirely. 
Connecticut’s flagship resettlement agency, Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, lost $4 million in federal funding. As a result, the agency closed offices in Hartford and New Haven.
War drove a University of Connecticut student to flee from Baghdad, Iraq with her family. IRIS supplied the refugee family with food, a studio apartment and legal counsel upon their arrival. 
The second-year student, who requested anonymity, said she fears ongoing deportations, but feels supported in her new hometown of New Haven and within the community she built at the University of Connecticut. A university sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, held a donation drive for IRIS in late September. 
“I am grateful for the education and opportunities America has given me,” she said.
Some organizations diversified their income streams to continue offering services to refugees years after their arrival. 
Trump’s executive order contends the U.S. can’t absorb large numbers of immigrants — particularly refugees — “in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.”
Hillary Baez, the refugee services assistant program manager of Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas saw the changes coming. “Our organization basically took that as an initiative to try and find other sources of funding to ask for more donations from our donors,” she said. 
The organization opened a thrift store and has plans to open three more “as just another way for us to keep ourselves running,” Baez said. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, one of 10 national organizations that partnered with the federal government to distribute resettlement funds, announced in April it would end its partnership. Two Catholic Charities affiliates — Northeast Kansas and Central and Northern Missouri — were among those that ended their local refugee resettlement programs. 
When Catholic Charities of Central and Northern Missouri in Jefferson City dissolved its refugee services in March, three of its employees moved to City of Refuge in nearby Columbia.  
Refugees that the organization helped were directed to City of Refuge and Della Lamb Community Services, another nonprofit, in Kansas City. 
Visitors touring City of Refuge on a recent morning saw civics classes where refugees prepared for the citizenship test with questions like: If the president and vice president are unable to serve, who takes over? Touring guests knew the answer (the speaker of the House) but couldn’t recall the current speaker’s name. 
“Mike Johnson,” a man seated in the class said under his breath. 
Cing Cing Hlamyo weighs ginger roots for a customer on Sept. 30 at Shwe Market International Foods in Columbia (photo by Annie George).
City of Refuge has continued to provide citizenship classes even as the Trump administration cut federal funding for similar services to other organizations. Up to $500,000 in federal funding for the nonprofit will expire in October 2026, and it’s not clear what federal funding will be available after. Because of that, the City of Refuge is looking to diversify its financial support.
Hlyamo is one example of what those who have benefited from City of Refuge have accomplished.
By many accounts, Hlamyo, one of more than 3.6 million refugees who entered the U.S. in the last 50 years, achieved the American dream. 
She was five months pregnant and owned one jacket when she and her husband arrived, their 18-month-old daughter in tow, in November 2009 to face their first Midwest winter. 
Growing up in Myanmar was fraught. Hlamyo watched soldiers beat her father – the military wanted use of his truck, but its engine was broken. They forced her family into unpaid labor. 
Hlamyo now enjoys the fruits of her hard work in America. The mother of four owns an Asian grocery store, one of the few places in mid-Missouri where shoppers can find frozen octopus, bitter melon, jackfruit chips and South Asian specialties. Her eldest daughter is applying for college.  
 No help for 2025 arrivals 

A court order required the Trump administration to admit refugees who had approved applications and confirmed travel plans by Jan. 20. 
An attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, which sued on behalf of resettlement agencies and refugees, said 70-100 people entered the country as a result of the injunction. 
Baez said Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas welcomed three refugees from Eritrea, in East Africa, after Jan. 20 because the group already had flights to the US. 
However, federal funding cuts meant they couldn’t get assistance previously available to recent arrivals. Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas could still provide services such as employment and English assistance. 
Tatjana Bozhinovski, resettlement program director at Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services in Columbus, Ohio, said her organization was affected by the executive order on day one.
A single mother with four children arrived on Jan. 17, and three days later, Bozhinovski had to tell the family that the nonprofit could no longer help them find housing, enroll kids in school or find jobs. 
“You can’t possibly do that if you have a heart and if you have a soul,” Bozhinovski said. Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services lost 75% of its staff, many of them refugees, as a result of the federal money freeze. 
Some people with confirmed travel plans were still unable to enter following the executive order.  
Tyler Reeve of Community Refugee & Immigration Services in Columbus helped some members of a family arrive on Jan. 17. The rest were unable to enter, even though they were approved as refugees and had purchased plane tickets for February. The family is separated indefinitely. Layoffs left the organization with no full-time resettlement staff. 
Jewish Family Services in Columbus lost more than $2 million.
Tariq Mohamed, the nonprofit’s senior director of refugee services, welcomed a teenage boy and girl right before Jan. 20, expecting their parents and the rest of their siblings to arrive in February. The family doesn’t know when they will see each other again.
The nonprofit has been able to continue some of its other programs, including helping refugees already in the U.S. find employment, register their kids for school and get vaccines, as federal funding still exists for those.
From Oct. 1 to Jan. 20, Jewish Family Services resettled 184 people, doing an entire year’s worth of work in three months before the order passed, in anticipation of Trump’s actions. 
Under Biden’s administration, refugee admissions for the fiscal year 2024, which ended last October, reached 100,034, the highest annual total since 1995.
“It was a big, big ramp up over the last few years,” said Paul Costigan, Missouri’s state refugee coordinator. 
 Few new arrivals

A spokesperson for the State Department, which oversees the refugee resettlement program, did not provide numbers when asked how many refugees have entered the country since Trump took office this year. 
The Trump administration is considering a new annual ceiling of 7,500 for fiscal year 2026, which started Oct. 1, according to reporting by The New York Times.
The Missouri Office of Refugee Administration used to get monthly reports from the State Department on how many refugees to expect and how many ultimately arrived. Those reports ceased in January, said Costigan. 
Princeton Alliance Church in Plainsboro, New Jersey, established refugee services in 2023 with approval from the State Department. It welcomed 135 immigrants before the executive order. The church had expected another 100 people this year, but only 26 made it in the waning days of the Biden administration.
Two people scheduled to arrive in late January had their tickets canceled, said Gay, the executive director of the church’s Alliance for Refugees. 
Final Refugee Timeline_1022
 
Under previous administrations, Jewish Vocational Service was Kansas City’s largest refugee resettlement agency. In fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the agency resettled 409 and 630 refugees, respectively. Following Jan. 20, the agency has served only 60 new arrivals.
Reese Taw’s work at Jewish Vocational Service is personal. A member of Karen, an ethnic minority group in Myanmar, Taw and his family arrived in the U.S. as refugees when he was nine. A resettlement agency helped his family adjust to life in America. 
“I get to help the same people that were in my position a while ago because I can relate to the frustration,” Taw said. “Just being able to serve the community, as a whole, it’s fulfilling to me.”
Taw was one of 12 employees the nonprofit laid off in March. He was rehired, but the organization is grappling with funding loss. “We’ll try to survive as long as we can, but we’ll see what happens,” Taw said.
 States assume larger role

Looking to the future, Costigan of the Missouri refugee office predicts an overhauled refugee resettlement program where states have more control. Some states are already putting their own funding behind programs cut by the federal government.
New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy created the state’s Office of New Americans in 2019, amid Trump’s first-term immigration crackdown. New Jersey had at least $1 million cut since Trump returned to office in January, state budget documents show. Murphy pledged to double the state’s support for its initiatives. 
New Jersey lawmakers this year boosted the state-run Refugee Resettlement Program to $29.5 million, six times greater than the previous year. The money goes to seven nonprofits, which offer refugees cash, case management, job assistance, health expenses and other aid. 
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill in March allocating $2.8 million to programs targeted by the Trump administration. IRIS, New Haven’s flagship resettlement agency, and another organization received a total of approximately $500,000.
People involved in refugee resettlement say the commitment from local communities has remained steady. 
Jewish Vocational Service saw an outpouring of support from the Kansas City community after losing its federal funding for refugee services.
At a September meeting in Joplin, a city of 53,000 in southwest Missouri, people from the fire department, community college and city government showed up to coordinate assistance for recently arrived refugees. 
“The community commitment is there,” Costigan said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican former assemblyman hoping to be elected governor on Nov. 4, wants to pull New Jersey out of a multistate compact that boosts costs for fossil fuel plants in hopes the withdrawal will control recent rises in electricity rates.
Ciattarelli, who has made rising utility bills a focus of his campaign for the governorship, says it’s time for New Jersey to leave the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative again, arguing a program created in 2005 to limit emissions is now just boosting costs for Garden State ratepayers.
“That carbon tax initiative has been a failure. Air’s no cleaner. Electricity’s only more expensive,” Ciattarelli said at a debate last month. “By pulling out of RGGI, we can save half a billion dollars a year for ratepayers.”
Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — or RGGI, pronounced Reggie — is a cap-and-trade system meant to lower greenhouse gas emissions by requiring fossil fuel plants to purchase tradable emission allowances at annual auctions. In effect, member states require fossil fuel plants within their borders to pay to pollute.
The cost of purchasing those allowances is added to the cost of producing electricity, raising rates for fossil generators in RGGI states, which receive revenue from the sale of emission allowances.
The added costs have impacts at multiple levels. By raising operating costs for fossil generators, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative can direct grid demand to generators in other states that would be more expensive than those in New Jersey if not for the added cost of emission allowances, said Richard Tabors, president of energy consulting firm Tabors Caramanis Rudkevich.
In some cases, the dynamic results in increased emissions because the allowances can push costs for gas plants in RGGI states past those of coal plants in states not party to the initiative, leading the grid to use generators that create more pollution.
PJM Interconnection, which operates the grid used by New Jersey and 12 other states, selects power producers beginning with the lowest price and moving upward until it has drawn enough electricity to meet demand. That means some New Jersey plants run less often than competitors in non-RGGI states because of the cost of emission allowances.
“The way the math works out is that New Jersey, because it had the penalties on its high-quality [gas] units and gas prices went up again a little bit — a lot for a while — it meant that coal-fired generation in a state that did not have RGGI rules was supplying energy to the clean state of New Jersey,” said Tabors.

New Jersey has left RGGI before. Under Republican Gov. Chris Christie, the state pulled out of the initiative in 2011, then rejoined under the current governor, Phil Murphy. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January.
RGGI was initially successful in reducing emissions by pushing power production away from the plants that produce the most pollution. Mostly, those were coal plants, and the last coal-fired generators in New Jersey closed in 2022.
Between 2009 and 2023, Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey collectively reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by 46%, Tabors found in a February white paper.
But that dynamic reversed as New Jersey moved its generation toward natural gas and renewables. Because of the emission allowances and increases to the price of natural gas, among other factors, coal plants in Pennsylvania and other PJM states ran more often.
Tabor’s study estimates that in 2025, carbon dioxide emissions would rise by 2.9 million tons and electricity spending would increase by a net $436 million across the three RGGI states because of costs added by the initiative.
“The penalty was very much focused on coal-fired generation, and it was successful,” Tabors said. “Now, you have to ask the question: Is RGGI still doing what it was designed to do? For New Jersey, the answer is pretty clearly no.”
Because RGGI effectively levies a surcharge on some generators that is passed through to ratepayers, withdrawing from the program would necessarily reduce electricity costs, though the degree of savings is less clear.
There’s no guarantee that fossil generators that must buy emission allowances under RGGI would remove the full cost of those allowances from their prices if New Jersey withdraws from the program. Nothing apart from market forces would demand they do, and shifts in the price of natural gas and coal can already make RGGI gas plants cheaper than non-RGGI coal plants.
“It would definitely reduce the prices in the energy market, but I need to follow the ball a little further to see what happens after those prices go down,” said Brian Lipman, director of the state rate counsel division, which advocates for ratepayers on utility matters.
Most of the money generated by the sale of RGGI emission allowances is returned to participating states, though a small percentage is withheld to fund the organization that auctions off allowances.
The revenue can be significant. It brought New Jersey as much as $275 million in 2024, according to a New Jersey Monitor review of auction results.
Overwhelmingly, New Jersey has used that money to fund electric vehicle infrastructure and subsidize purchases of medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles, like buses, though significant portions have also gone to shore restoration, building electrification, and carbon sequestration.
The Board of Public Utilities could fund those programs through the state’s societal benefits charge, a separate surcharge applied to New Jersey utility bills, Lipman said.
More recently, revenue from the societal benefits charge and RGGI was tapped to directly reduce ratepayer bills through bill credits that will be applied to balances accrued in September and October. Murphy and other Democratic state leaders announced that plan earlier this year in response to anger about rising utility bills.
Ciattarelli’s campaign said the state could still fund those priorities absent RGGI revenue.
“The budget has gone up 70% in 8 years,” said Nick Poche, a campaign spokesperson. “The idea that we can’t prioritize how to better spend our money and make sure key priorities are taken care of is a false premise.”
Other states’ participation in RGGI could also change the impact of a withdrawal. At present, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia are the only three PJM states to participate in the initiative. Ten states, all of them in the northeast and most run by Democrats, are enrolled in RGGI.
Pennsylvania sought to join the compact in 2022, but that bid has been marred by litigation that questions whether state regulators encroached on lawmakers’ constitutional taxing authority.
Electricity on PJM’s grid is sold along the entire 13-state market, and the financial benefits of New Jersey withdrawing from RGGI would be spread along that grid.
In the same vein, more states joining RGGI would limit its impact on the competitiveness of New Jersey plants, though there’s little indication elected leaders elsewhere would join the program as rates rise along the entirety of PJM’s grid.
“If Pennsylvania was in RGGI, they would have the same surcharge, and they would not be cheaper than the New Jersey plants,” said Lipman, whose office has not taken a formal position on RGGI.
The New Jersey Legislature’s composition — Democrats hold majorities in the Assembly and Senate — won’t directly impact efforts to withdraw from the compact. Republicans hope to gain control of the Assembly after November’s elections, but Senate seats are not on the ballot.
State law permits New Jersey to join RGGI but does not require it to do so, and it gives state energy regulators, rather than lawmakers, the authority to leave or join the initiative.
At present, three of the five Board of Public Utility seats are filled, including a seat held by Republican Commissioner Michael Bange. Confirmations could give a Ciattarelli governorship a majority on the regulator’s board.
It’s not clear how the board’s current members would respond to a gubernatorial push to withdraw from RGGI, nor is it clear whether the Democrat-held Senate would confirm Board of Public Utility nominees who would vote to depart from the compact.
The board’s commissioners serve six-year staggered terms. Bange’s term expires in 2030, while BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy’s term expires in 2029. Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou is set to remain until 2028.

Creating lasting livability is exactly what Vermont’s Act 181 aims to do.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kati Gallagher: Decisions Vermonters make today will shape our communities for generations.","This commentary is by Kati Gallagher of Waterbury. She is sustainable communities program director for the Vermont Natural Resources Council.


From my home in Waterbury Center, Vermont, just a few steps across the street takes me to a park where I can walk my dog and (theoretically) play disc golf. A stroll behind my house brings me to our local pottery studio, and to the south, I can walk to a farmstand while listening to the community band practice on the green.
Hiking and mountain biking trails are also easily accessible from my house, and this proximity allows me to venture deep in the woods where Vermont’s breathtaking natural resources are on full display. This reality — being able to access a thriving community center and open spaces — is the magic that drew me to this corner of the world.
But these qualities that make Vermont communities desirable are slipping away. Rising costs and limited housing mean families can’t find homes near schools, shops or parks. Downtown businesses can’t keep staff because housing rentals are scarce and expensive. Farms are harder to hold onto due to increasing land costs, while forest habitat is being dissected by new driveways. As climate change-driven extreme weather hits harder, the way we build will either improve or hinder our resilience.
Land use ties it all together: it dictates whether or not communities can grow without losing their identity, whether or not families can afford to stay, and whether or not Vermont remains both livable and resilient for generations to come.
Creating lasting livability is exactly what Vermont’s Act 181 aims to do. Enacted in 2024, Act 181 was designed to address and modernize land use laws to help protect natural resources and working lands while advancing sustainable development. This law was built on years of research, study groups, and legislative debate focused on how to update the state’s land use and development law (Act 250) and align it with state investments and regional and local land use plans.
One of the most powerful tools Act 181 puts in our hands is regional future land use maps. In the past, these maps were largely advisory, used by Vermont’s regional planning commissions to illustrate where different areas might be designated for future growth or conservation. Now for the first time, they carry real regulatory weight by being tied to Act 250 jurisdiction and providing towns a path to seek exemptions from Act 250 review for downtowns and village centers.
In addition, the maps are tied to the State Designation Program, as the mapping process provides eligibility for state tax credits and grants to strengthen our downtowns and village centers. 
Act 181 also enhances protection of Vermont’s most critical natural resources and working lands. By requiring Act 250 review for projects outside of growth areas with especially long roads and driveways, the new law will discourage scattered development that fragments farmland and forests. Development projects that fall under Act 250 review will now assess their environmental impact on forest fragmentation and wildlife, encouraging better site design. And a current stakeholder process will identify which of the state’s most sensitive natural resources require environmental review.
In short: instead of letting growth scatter in ways that strain families, businesses and natural systems — and which requires sprawling infrastructure that costs more for local taxpayers to build and maintain — Act 181 helps communities plan for and invest in smarter, more intentional development to meet our housing needs.
The benefits of planning for sustainable and balanced growth are wide-ranging:

Stronger downtowns. Concentrating limited state funding and leveraging existing investments in historic downtowns helps local businesses succeed, supports public spaces, protects taxpayers and makes it easier for people to live close to what they need.
Connected neighborhoods. By streamlining permitting for housing in and around town and village centers, and designing those areas with sidewalks, bike lanes, and safe crossings, communities can create neighborhoods where young families can find starter homes, workers can rent affordably, older Vermonters can age in place, and everyone enjoys safe, convenient connections to schools, shops and services.
Resilient landscapes. Compact growth patterns protect farmland, forests and clean water, while reducing the emissions that come with long commutes.

But here’s the key: the land use maps that will shape future development in Vermont aren’t handed down from the Statehouse. They’re built through local conversations where residents bring their hopes and concerns to the table. Every Vermonter has a role to play.
In the months ahead, regional planning commissions (RPCs) will be asking you to help shape where growth should and shouldn’t go. Many RPCs have started, and Rutland RPC has already submitted their draft land use plan to the new Land Use Review Board for review. The Review Board will be analyzing compliance with the requirements of Act 181. Maps from the Chittenden County RPC and Northwest RPC will soon be submitted too.
The everyday magic of being able to walk to a park, grab fresh corn from a farmstand or catch up with neighbors at the store is what makes Vermont so special — and what Act 181 is designed to protect and strengthen. By showing up in these local conversations and taking an active role in community planning, we can ensure that the Vermont we pass on still feels like home: connected, vibrant and rooted in the landscapes that define us.
You can find more information through your regional planning commission or at the VNRC website.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A former landscaping supervisor at Auburn University filed a lawsuit against the school Tuesday, alleging the university fired him over social media posts related to the shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.
It is the second such lawsuit filed this month, following the university’s decision in September to fire an unspecified number of employees over social media posts related to Kirk. 
The lawsuit says that Kevin Courtwright, a former landscape supervisor who shared a Facebook post critical of Kirk, made comments that were “insensitive, offensive and inflammatory” but added that “that means they were exactly the type of speech the First Amendment protects.”
A spokesperson for Auburn University Thursday declined comment, citing a policy of not commenting on pending litigation.
The complaint names Auburn University President Christopher Roberts; Jim Carroll, vice president of facilities management for the university, and Loren Winn, the facilities human resources director for the school as defendants.
Following Kirk’s death on Sept. 10, Courtwright reposted a post on Facebook that condemned Kirk.
“So, Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at one of his events. The man who said that school shootings were just something worth living with in order to keep the 2nd amendment, who leaned into every single culture war issue to push hate and division, and who was making absurd claims about trans people being mass shooters at the time he was [Redacted], is likely going to be used for some justification to crack down on something by this regime,” the post said.
According to the lawsuit, after sharing the post, Courtwright posted “One fascist down; a whole socio-political movement go. FAFO nazi trash” to his Facebook page.
The complaint also said Courtwright reshared several other posts that condemned gun violence and Kirk’s death.
“No one should be shot, Charlie Kirk included. But let’s be real: Republican leaders crying crocodile tears about gun violence while BLOCKING every piece of gun reform are the reason it keeps happening. DOING NOTHING is the choice THEY have made,” said one of the posts shared by Courtwright.
On Sept. 15, the lawsuit said Courtwright’s wife, who is also an Auburn employee, was approached by Chris Hardman, a coordinator for behavioral threat assessment and management and Scott Forehand, director of compliance, investigations and security, to question her about her husband.
The complaint said Hardman and Forehand told Courtwright’s wife that a student filed a complaint about the Facebook posts and asked her what Courtwright would do if he “came upon a tabling event for Turning Point USA” on campus.
Turning Point USA is a non-profit organization founded by Kirk that advocates for conservative politics on high school, college and university campuses.
Courtwright alleges that after his wife was questioned, he was summoned by the facilities human resources office to speak with Clarence Stewart from Auburn’s security and compliance team.
During the meeting with Stewart, Courtwright said he was told that a complaint was made about his Facebook post and was questioned on if the post had any violent intent.
On Sept. 16, the lawsuit said Courtwright met with Winn to explain to her that there was a misunderstanding of his post. After explaining, he asked Winn if he would be fired.
Courtwright alleges that Winn told him that “Auburn tends not to move drastically, and she was inclined to think he would not be fired, but there was a chance.” 
After his meeting with Winn, the complaint said Stewart called Courtwright to tell him to make his Facebook page private so others couldn’t view it, and to take down the posts about Kirk for “damage control,” which Courtwright said he did.
The following day, Courtwright said he was pulled for another meeting where Winn, Stewart and Carroll were waiting for him. During the meeting, he was allegedly told that he violated University Code 8.3.3 and was placed on administrative leave.
The code includes:

“Intimidating or intentionally imposing on the rights and privileges of other employees”
“Engaging in grossly offensive, obscene, or immoral conduct”
“Any actions deemed by the University as constituting major misconduct.”

That same day, Roberts posted a statement on social media that multiple employees were fired for their social media posts. The university did not give a specific number of employees that were terminated.
On Sept. 22, Courtwright said he was fired from the university and the following day he received a letter stating that he was terminated.
“After a thorough review of all relevant information, it has been determined that your actions are in direct violation of Auburn University’s Personnel Policies and Procedures (Group I offenses),” the letter Courtwright got said. “Group I violations include conduct regarded as major misconduct, behavior that is grossly offensive or immoral, and a gross disregard of obligations to the University.”
The lawsuit also cites a comment by Roberts reported by the Auburn Plainsman, the university’s student newspaper, that he regretted parts of his statement that “caused confusion over ‘offensive speech vs threatening speech.’”
The complaint argues that Courtwright’s posts weren’t threatening and that his posts had no impact on how he did his job.
“However ill-considered [the] defendant[s] perceived [Courtwright’s] comments to be, his comments did not render him unfit for his job as a Landscape Supervisor,” the complaint said.
Earlier this month, Candice Hale, a former lecturer at Auburn, said she was fired for sharing her thoughts on Kirk’s death on Facebook.
Hale said in her complaint that she was also questioned by Hardman and Forehand about her post and “how students who were in the University’s Turning Point USA chapter would feel about her comments.”
She said she was not aware that the university had a Turning Point chapter.
On Sept. 24, after having another meeting with other Auburn officials, Hale said she was summoned for another meeting where she was told the school wanted to end her employment and gave her 21 days to consider a severance agreement.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Auburn-University-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-24 07:16:39.262051

This summer, the state of Louisiana texted just over 13,000 people enrolled in its Medicaid program with a link to a website where they could confirm their incomes.
The texts were part of a pilot run to test technology the Trump administration says will make it easier for some Medicaid enrollees to prove they meet new requirements — working, studying, job training, or volunteering at least 80 hours a month — set to take effect in just over a year.
But only 894 people completed the quarterly wage check, or just under 7% of enrollees who got the text, according to Drew Maranto, undersecretary for the Louisiana Department of Health.
“We’re hoping to get more to opt in,” Maranto said. “We plan to raise awareness.”
The clock is ticking for officials in 42 states — excluding those that did not expand Medicaid at all — and Washington, D.C., to figure out how to verify that an estimated 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees meet rules included in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law. They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.
The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the work rules will be the main reason millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.
For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona. Mehmet Oz, director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”
“There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz, during a television appearance in August.
Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a recent radio appearance that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”
KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.
Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs began under the Biden administration.
And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.
“Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said Joan Alker, a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.
Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.
The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.
“What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.
Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.
Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.
The Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona, a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.
State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.
Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”
One person doing that development is Michael Burstein, who until recently worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.
As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called Digital Public Works to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.
But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”
The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems, many of which need updating, which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.
The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals roughly four times what it cost to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.
That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a temporary extension, despite a recent report from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A complicated sign-up process has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.
Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with high unemployment rates to be exempted, but states must apply for that exemption.
Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As KFF Health News has reported, millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.
Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said Jennifer Wagner, who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.
“Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.

(Courtesy photo)Writing and editing for The Post, the student newspaper at Ohio University, is what made me the journalist I am today. Watching what is happening to student journalism in Indiana is devastating.
Moves at the state’s two flagships, Purdue University and Indiana University, show that college news media is in jeopardy.
Students learn the basics of the job in journalism courses. They learn the history of journalism, the ethics of being a reporter and how to use tools of the craft.
But writing for a daily or weekly publication gives you so much more. The Post is where I learned to connect with sources, build relationships, dig into data and records and put together stories that educate and connect with readers.
It gave me true experience — not like turning in a story to one professor for a grade.
At Purdue University, the administration halted on-campus distribution of The Exponent. The paper was told to remove the “Purdue” part of its name for all commercial uses. The Purdue Student Publishing Foundation currently has a trademark over the name. The Exponent’s employees are no longer allowed to buy campus parking passes, either.
But it’s way worse at Indiana University, which has a proud history of championing journalism and public transparency.
Leaders at IU’s Media School pressured the Indiana Daily Student’s adviser to remove non-homecoming stories from the special print edition set to be published on campus last week. The adviser resisted and was fired. The school then canceled all special print editions.
Look, many college papers are now digital and that’s just a sad fact. Print is expensive.
But the student media plan that IU agreed to includes special print editions. This kind of edition is especially important during homecoming, when alumni are on campus and can pick up the paper to see what’s going on at their alma mater.
Braun appointees join IU board; changes made to protest policy

Administrators don’t want alumni to see what’s up, apparently. They only wanted fluff pieces about homecoming in the edition. And when student journalists pushed back, IU canceled the entire thing with no notice.
So, what was so offensive that it sparked this blowup? The entire edition was posted online. It includes 12 pages of homecoming coverage — and more.
A feature on a wrestling club. A story on the data center boom. Dogs in costumes at a parade. A photo story on the Great Glass Pumpkin Patch. A new Habitat for Humanity build.
The only slightly controversial piece is a story on a documentary about free speech on the IU campus.
“This is not about print. This is about a breach of editorial independence,” a letter from Co-Editors Mia Hilkowitz and Andrew Miller reads. “If IU decides certain types of content are ‘bad for business,’ what stops them from prohibiting stories that hold them to account on our other platforms?”
Many say this is “just” a special print edition, but that’s how censorship starts. The next time, students could be told not to cover stories that might embarrass the administration in the online edition. And that’s not a game to play.
More than money
There is a fair discussion to be had about money. The IDS had run up a deficit of almost $1 million over a decade, which the university cleared last year. The Media School issued a student media action plan that said print editions are still important.
“We will maintain plans for existing special editions regularly published during the academic year. Preserving these high-revenue issues will yield a net savings (print expense reduction will outweigh lost revenue from weekly editions) and will enable student media to continue to provide numerous and substantial opportunities for students to learn and practice essential design and other skills associated with the print operation,” it reads.
I have seen a lot of discussion about the deficit and how it came to exist, and I just want to note that many activities on a campus individually run a deficit. Public education isn’t a business. It’s about teaching students — and let me tell you, nothing works better than doing it for real.
The entire Indiana University athletics department ran a $3.1 million deficit for the 2024 fiscal year, and I didn’t hear anyone complaining. There are absolutely individual sports that lose money but are subsidized by more high-profile sports. And that’s fine, because sports are a part of the educational experience. They teach teamwork, responsibility and commitment.
All three of those are also things that student journalists learn at the Indiana Daily Student.
The IU administration needs to review its actions, and these students deserve an apology. Gov. Mike Braun remade the board of trustees and this is a great opportunity for them to step in and reverse course.

Funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will allow the state to keep up food benefits under the Women, Infants and Children program, known as WIC, and support the 11 workers still administering it in Washington.
“It’s definitely a relief,” said Nicole Flateboe, executive director of Nutrition First, the state’s WIC association. “It’s food benefits through Thanksgiving, hopefully.”
The estimate of assistance lasting until mid-to-late November is based on current use. If enrollees start increasing their usage, the funding could run out sooner, according to the state Department of Health. 
An agriculture department spokesperson said Thursday that the agency “utilized tariff revenue to fund WIC for the foreseeable future.” It was unclear exactly how much money the feds were providing.
WIC benefits have been among the most vulnerable to the ongoing shutdown. When the shutdown began Oct. 1, the state had about two weeks’ worth of funding to keep feeding low-income Washingtonians enrolled in WIC. 
Redirected tariff revenue from the Trump administration is allowing states to get through October, but that $300 million infusion would only last through the end of the month.
In Washington, over 200 clinics serve more than 212,000 women and their children younger than 5 years old annually under the WIC program, according to the state. WIC helps nearly one-third of all newborn babies. Nationally, the program serves nearly 7 million Americans.
WIC helps mothers with access to healthy food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and health screenings. Research has shown participation in the program helps avoid low birth weights and reduce maternal mortality. 
The new money announced Thursday is focused on food benefits, not the program’s other services.
Earlier this month, King County and Seattle officials promised that the nearly 30,000 enrollees there would receive one-time vouchers for food and baby formula through a partnership with Safeway if funding runs out. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the program, while the state Department of Health administers it in Washington. WIC participants can purchase food using electronic benefit transfer cards, which work like debit cards.
Money for the program flows from the federal government to the state and then some of it to the clinics, which provide WIC services and help to get people enrolled in the program. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged to make back payments once the shutdown ends. But as of earlier this month, the state had not, Flateboe said. And the expenses are too big for some of the clinics to take on without a guarantee they’ll be made whole. 
Earlier this month, Nutrition First called on the state to adjust its contracts with the clinics to ensure reimbursement. Flateboe said Thursday that the Department of Health is now working on revising those contracts.
Still, one of those clinics, at the Spokane Regional Health District, has issued layoff notices to roughly 30 employees effective at the end of October, out of fear of not getting reimbursed.
“Without this assurance, SRHD can only support staff costs through the end of October,” spokesperson Kelli Hawkins said in an email. “We are hopeful that the federal government shutdown will end soon, allowing for WIC funding to continue. At that time, SRHD can rescind the layoff notices and continue offering this vital service to our community.”
About 50 employees at the state health department have been temporarily laid off or had their hours reduced due to the shutdown. Most were working in the division that manages WIC. With the new funding, those employees will return to work Nov. 3, but if the shutdown continues, they could be laid off again three days later, said Department of Health spokesperson Raechel Sims.
Meanwhile, funding for federal food stamps  — a program that is separate from WIC —   is set to run dry at the end of October. Washington’s U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, along with other Senate Democrats, called on Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday to open up funding to allow benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to continue into November.
In a letter, the senators noted the way Rollins’ agency was able to open up funding to maintain WIC benefits and said the same should be done for SNAP.
“Americans are already struggling with the rising cost of groceries, and they cannot afford a sudden lapse in grocery assistance,” the letter reads. “We urge you to immediately communicate to states and committees of jurisdiction the USDA’s plans to disburse the contingency funding to state agencies and utilize all available legal authorities so that American families can get benefits without interruption.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baby-formula-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 07:16:39.262051

A clinic planned in Hudson County would treat patients up to 34 weeks.,"New Jersey abortion clinics don't offer the procedure past 27 weeks. A clinic planned in Hudson County would treat patients up to 34 weeks. (Getty Images)Abortion foes often criticize New Jersey for allowing abortion “up until the moment of birth,” because the state is one of just nine nationally that sets no limit on when someone can end their pregnancy.
But clinics here don’t provide abortions past the second trimester, which means people who seek abortions after then must head to other states.
That’s expected to change next year, when a nonprofit aims to open an all-trimester clinic in Hudson County that will provide abortion up to 34 weeks, as well as gender-affirming care for all ages, HIV care, and other services.
Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist, and Cathy Obando, a nurse practitioner, say the services they will provide at Luminosas Wellness Collective have become critically important as states around the country increasingly restrict or ban them and providers scale back services to dodge protests, funding cuts, or stigma.
“A lot of people have concerns around providing abortion and providing gender-affirming care in the political landscape right now, but we are providing care because we know people need this care and they’ve had very limited access to it,” Brandi said.
New Jersey has become known as a “safe haven” for abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with legislators codifying abortion rights here, funding family planning, and passing laws to protect abortion patients and practitioners from states that criminalize it, among other measures.
But most New Jersey clinics cut off abortion access the later a woman goes into pregnancy, with Planned Parenthood providing it up to 16 weeks and 6 days and just two clinics, in Cherry Hill and Englewood, performing the procedure up to 27 weeks and six days into pregnancy. For New Jersey patients seeking abortions at or after 28 weeks, the closest clinics are in Maryland and Washington, D.C.
Late abortions are scarce nationally too, with only 10 providers offering them from 28 to 34 weeks, according to LaterAbortion.org.
Most people who get abortions get them in the first trimester. People seek abortions later than that often because of newly diagnosed health problems with the fetus or parent, or a change of family circumstance such as job loss, said Bonyen Lee-Gilmore of Patient Forward, a national group that advocates against gestational bans. Young people who don’t recognize they’re pregnant until later in a pregnancy also are overrepresented among second- and third-trimester abortions, she added.
And increasingly, people get abortions in the second trimester or after because some states have created hurdles that can delay getting the procedure, Lee-Gilmore said, including consent requirements, mandates for pre-abortion counseling, or ultrasounds. She added that the costs and logistics of traveling to a different state for abortions, among other things, create more challenges.
“That sort of gauntlet that patients have always had to run in order to access abortion has just gotten more and more complicated in a post-Roe world. And so people are getting pushed later into pregnancy,” she said.
Brandi and Obando know New Jersey’s abortion protections could shift too, as soon as next year when a new governor will take over from term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy. In that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill has vowed to uphold the state’s abortion protections, but Republican Jack Ciattarelli has said he supports banning abortion after 20 weeks except for rape, incest, or when the health of the mother is in danger.
Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Marie Tasy, who heads New Jersey Right to Life, said if Brandi and Obando are allowed to move forward with their clinic, it “would leave an indelible stain on New Jersey.”
“This clinic’s stated mission is deeply perverse, making it one of the most extreme examples of the abortion industry’s lack of humanity,” Tasy said.
Brandi and Obando remain committed to open by next summer, with a mission of serving underserved populations that have long faced barriers to health care and dismissive medical professionals. They’re still working to secure a location and aim eventually to train the next generation of providers, as abortion becomes increasingly endangered.
“We have felt the anxiety and the worry patients bring with them when they come in, especially from patients traveling out of state,” Obando said. “They’re definitely grateful for the services and the lifeline that they receive in New Jersey.”
Brandi, a former board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said her commitment to reproductive rights grew after Roe was overturned.
“We need to take care of everybody in our community, and just because the politics are crazy right now, that doesn’t mean that they don’t deserve care,” she said.
She’s gotten hate mail for her work, so she’s tightened security at her home. She and Obando plan to make safety a top priority at their new clinic too.
“It’s scary,” Brandi said. “I think we’re trying to meet the moment. We know that it’s a tough moment for reproductive health care, but if we don’t do it, who will?”

This week’s news brings us another story that’s starting to get very old — especially for Montana’s existing residents.  Namely, the City of East Helena finds itself unable to “meet the demand” for water for the 6,250 new homes plus new businesses that theoretically will be built on former ASARCO lands the city annexed when the company went bankrupt. 
But here’s the rub: The land the city annexed did not come with water rights.  In Montana, no water means no new developments because we can barely provide water to existing residents.  The rapidly changing climate’s longer, hotter, and drier summers combined with lower winter snowpacks and earlier, diminished runoff is simply a reality that municipalities and developers don’t want to acknowledge.  But just because you don’t want to admit reality doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
As reported, Montana’s Lt. Governor Kristen Juras sent a letter to the city telling them the Natural Resources Damage settlement with ASARCO for the lead smelter’s Superfund site pollution requires “natural resource restoration and long-term stewardship.” Part of that restoration process, which was public, determined that certain water rights should go to restore instream flows on Prickly Pear Creek, which flows right past the giant slag piles remaining at the smelter site. 
Ironically, the state and EPA offered the city 40% of the water rights, but the offer was refused.  Now, the state and the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks are moving forward to change those consumptive water rights to instream flows and restore the battered creek.
That the city and developers are demanding the water for future development makes little sense since the mayor was quoted saying East Helena has an “already strained municipal water system.”  Since the theoretical developments would require four times the water the city currently supplies to existing residents and businesses it may also require a new and very expensive water treatment facility for which existing residents will pay. 
If this sounds familiar, one need only look to Bozeman, where residents will soon vote on the Water Adequacy for Residential Development initiative that will require new developments to either provide lower income units or bring new water rights to the city to “meet the demand” of the new developments.
Like Bozeman, East Helena is in a “closed basin” — meaning no new water rights can be issued without harming existing water rights holders and users.  You can’t give away more water than you have — and Montana has less every year, as the record low flows and closures of our major rivers proves.
None of this is a mystery.  In 1878 John Wesley Powell, who had explored the West’s great rivers and made the first descent of the Colorado River, published his “Report on the Lands of the Arid Regions of the United States” in which he estimated only 2% of the land in the arid West could support agriculture or development due to the lack of water.  There’s simply no excuse for Montana’s development-crazed municipalities to ignore the facts of our increasingly limited water supply. 
Finally, one might wonder why the burdens of “meeting the demand” of developers – including data centers – falls on existing residents.  Or why the Superfund impacts from past extractive industries shouldn’t be remediated.  Or why existing residents and their kids in East Helena shouldn’t have a clean stream they can walk to and enjoy a genuine “Montana” experience?
There are very real limits to growth.  In the West, that’s a dwindling water supply – and it’s obviously time for Montanans to realize that fact and live with it.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/home-building-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-24 06:56:28.972580

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Exmainer)State Superintendent Jill Underly didn’t show up to answer questions from Wisconsin lawmakers about the process the Department of Public Instruction uses for investigating reports of sexual misconduct by educators and for determining licensing.
Underly was invited by the committee to deliver testimony and answer questions last week, after a report from The Capital Times last week found that DPI investigated over 200 cases of Wisconsin teachers, aides, substitutes and administrators accused of sexual misconduct or grooming behaviors toward students from 2018 to 2023. Underly she sent other representatives for the agency in her stead on Thursday. According to WisPolitics, Underly was out of state to accept an alumni award from Indiana University. 
The conversation surrounding the agency’s handling of sexual misconduct and grooming allegations and licensure was sparked by the CapTimes report, which  detailed a number of questions related to the system the agency uses to track data on cases, suggested the agency wasn’t making information readily available to the public and noted the few resources that the agency has to investigate cases and track information. 
In a YouTube video posted Thursday, Underly said lawmakers, law enforcement, educators and families would need to come to the table to build a “stronger system that protects every child and respects the rule of law.”  
“Let me be absolutely clear: the safety, dignity, and well-being of Wisconsin’s children is — and will always be — our first and most important responsibility,” Underly said. “We investigate every single complaint we receive. These investigations are conducted thoroughly, professionally, and within the legal authority given to us. Licensure actions — whether it is a suspension, revocation, or voluntary surrender — are not made lightly. They are based on evidence, not speculation; on due process, not headlines.” 
Last week, Underly called the report “misleading” in a letter and requested a retraction or correction from the CapTimes. In response, CapTimes Editor Mark Treinen said the paper  stands by the reporting. 
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) announced that she is working on a set of bills in response to the article. 
One bill focuses on implementing a criminal penalty for “grooming” of children by sexual predators in state statute. Nedweski also said she is drafting a bill to require school districts to adopt clear policies outlining appropriate communication boundaries between staff and students and a bill to prohibit DPI  from allowing teachers under investigation for sexual misconduct to surrender their teaching license to avoid further scrutiny. 
Lawmakers expressed concern at Underly’s absence, noting the seriousness of the issue. 
At the start of the hearing, Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona) said he was “disappointed” by Underly’s absence. 
“I am deeply, deeply disappointed that Superintendent Underly could not bring herself to the meeting,” Nedweski, who chairs the committee, said. “These are very, very serious issues.” 
Nedweski said she had a meeting with DPI staff on Monday, but the Underly never reached out to her to ask to reschedule the hearing. She said she would have gladly accommodated a different date.
“I guess she just couldn’t find it important enough,” she added.  
At a press conference after the hearing, Nedweski, Sen. John Jagler (R-Watertown) and U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is running for governor in 2026, criticized Underly for her absence. 
“I think it’s time for the governor to call on Jill Underly to either do her job or step aside,” U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
“I would call on [Gov. Tony Evers] at this point… do you find this acceptable? Is this acceptable what has gone on here in the state of Wisconsin?” Tiffany asked. “I think it’s time for the governor to call on Jill Underly to either do her job or step aside.”
Tiffany said he would ensure proper investigations and create a public dashboard showing why teachers lose their licenses if he is elected governor. 
DPI representatives and law enforcement discuss lack of “grooming” statute
The hearing began with testimony from Kenosha Chief of Police Patrick Patton, Deputy Chief of Police Joseph Labatore and officer Kate Schaper, who addressed  the difference between investigations conducted by law enforcement and the role of the DPI. 
DPI Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy delivered testimony and answered questions on behalf of Underly and the agency. He was joined by Rich Judge, who serves as DPI’s assistant superintendent of government and public affairs, and Jennifer Kammerud, who serves as the educator licensing director. 
McCarthy began his testimony by laying out the role of the agency in handling sexual misconduct and grooming allegations. He said the agency’s main role is in the state’s licensing system, which is how they can draw attention to people who shouldn’t be in the classroom. 
“When we hear about allegations … we are deadly serious,” McCarthy said. “We use all of the tools that we have available. We do not have subpoena power, but we do attempt to get information from anybody that can support a license investigation case, and given how sensitive these things are, we try to work as thoroughly and quickly as possible.” 
McCarthy noted that DPI typically receives accusations from law enforcement agencies, required reporting from local school districts, complaints from members of the public and from news media reports, which McCarthy said the agency scans frequently. 
Both McCarthy and the law enforcement officers spoke to concerns about the lack of a definition for grooming in Wisconsin state statute.
According to RAINN, grooming is the “deliberate act of building trust with a child, teen, or at-risk adult (such as an adult with a cognitive impairment) for the purpose of exploiting them sexually.”
DPI recommended in its testimony that a definition for grooming should include patterns of flirtatious behavior, making any effort to gain unreasonable access to or time alone with any student with no discernable educational purpose, engaging in any behavior that can reasonably be construed as involving an inappropriate relationship with a student and engaging in any other special treatment not in compliance with generally accepted educational practices.
McCarthy said lawmakers should consider requiring an annual training should they adopt a definition of grooming.
“We need to be reminding folks of the types of behaviors and things that we expect from them. It doesn’t matter what type of school,” McCarthy said. 
Questioning by lawmakers was tense and combative at times. 
Nedweski said she was unclear about why there is confusion over whether grooming can be used to remove a teacher’s license.
Current state law says that a teacher’s license can be revoked due to “immoral conduct,” which is defined as “conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.” 
“Do we have to explicitly write the word ‘grooming’ in this law to spell out that grooming is not commonly accepted moral at ethical standards? I tend to believe that most Wisconsinites would think the law is comprehensive. Any kind of behavior that resembles grooming in any definition is already covered there,” Nedweski said. 
McCathy said the statute right now is “vague and ambiguous.” 
“When we find these things we go after them,” McCarthy said. “The department is using all of its authority to put its foot down in the spaces and revoke licenses. We’re doing that in a space right now where the authority doesn’t necessarily back us in every instance.” 
The Assembly Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee voted unanimously to approve a motion to request that Attorney General Josh Kaul provide an opinion on two questions: whether grooming is “contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards” and does grooming “endanger the health, safety, welfare or education” of a pupil.

Voluntary revocations and information on license status
McCarthy also told lawmakers that they view voluntary surrenders as an important tool for them. He said they will ask educators under investigation to do so throughout the process. 
The agency has noted that it often gives several opportunities for teachers to voluntarily surrender their licenses.
McCarthy said that voluntary surrenders related to a sexual misconduct investigation are most often lifetime surrenders, meaning that in a legal agreement they won’t be able to apply for an educator’s license again.
Revocations and voluntary surrenders are also reported to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC) — a national database that state education agencies can access that includes information about the misconduct. That database is not accessible to the public. 
McCarthy noted that information is available on the DPI website on the status of a teacher’s license, though one needs to know a licensee’s name in order to check. The information will say whether an educator’s license is under investigation, has been revoked or voluntarily surrendered, though it doesn’t include information on why. He said the agency is working with old, rigid software that makes it difficult to add additional information. 
Nedweski said she didn’t “buy” the explanation that the agency was giving.
“It’s remarkable because the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services can show you the reason for a license revocation for anyone,” Nedweski said, including explanations for manicurists. “It’s easier for me as a member of the public to find out why a cosmetologist lost their license and why it was revoked than it is for me to find out why a teacher license was revoked… Why is it so hard for us to find out critical safety information?” 
The agency requested $600,000 in the most recent state budget process to modernize its online background checks and licensing platform — a request that was rejected by the Republican-led Legislature.
The agency also suggested that lawmakers consider increasing reporting requirements to all school types and all individuals who are present in schools. McCarthy noted that the agency doesn’t have the ability to revoke licenses of people that don’t have to be licensed — including paraprofessionals and teachers in taxpayer-supported private schools. 
Lawmakers said they plan to provide Underly with other opportunities to speak in public forums about the issue. 
Jagler said the Senate Education Committee, which he chairs, will have an informational hearing on Nov. 4 where Underly will be the only invited speaker.
The Joint Audit Committee also noticed a hearing on Nov. 5 to launch an audit of educational licensure revocation, suspension, restriction and investigation at DPI.

The prospect of getting stuck with radioactive waste tops concerns, while elected officials spar over who is to blame for lack of unified support.
The post Politicized nuclear energy debate leaves residents conflicted, starving for credible answers appeared first on WyoFile .","If there were any doubts regarding a political divide around spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon put them to rest.
Following Radiant Industries’ announcement this month that it was pulling its proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility from Natrona County and taking it to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Gordon pinned the blame on the Wyoming Freedom Caucus.
“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”
Key to Radiant’s proposal was the fact that it required a change in state law to allow storage of spent nuclear fuel waste. A measure to do just that was tabled this summer by the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee amid an outpouring of opposition from around the state.

Gillette Republican Rep. John Bear said he suspects Gordon is vying to win support from political donors associated with the nuclear industry to potentially oust Freedom Caucus members in future elections.
“He’d like to have free reign over the state of Wyoming policies, even if it’s not him in office,” Bear told WyoFile. 
As Emeritus Chairman of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, Bear pointed to the group’s statement issued in July: “Wyoming must continue to be a leader in proven energy production, not settle as a dumping ground for nuclear waste from other states.”
“I’m taking an educate-the-public [approach] and detractors are taking an opposite approach, which I believe is to make the deal and tell the public about it,” Bear said.


Wyoming nuclear waste ban
Wyoming has flirted with the prospect of nuclear fuel waste storage for several decades and, so far, has stuck with a ban on storage — with one exception. Lawmakers passed House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.
Lawmakers have considered loosening the ban further. House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have potentially opened Wyoming’s doors to decades of nuclear waste that’s been accumulating at the nation’s nuclear power plants. That measure was rejected earlier this year along with Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” which would have accommodated Radiant’s proposal. An attempt to revive similar legislation during the interim this year was tabled.


Though no less caustic at times, residents in Natrona and Campbell counties have grappled with nuclear energy proposals, searching for answers about a high-stakes industry they’re not familiar with and assurances about the prospect of storing highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel waste near their homes.
“We’d like to get some fair information, some unbiased information that isn’t coming from people who stand to gain from these proposals,” Bar Nunn resident Lee-Ann Newquist told WyoFile. “It’s not a for-or-against issue. There are people in the middle who are not being represented.”

Monied, outside companies eager to plant the next generation of nuclear energy facilities in and around Wyoming are moving too quickly, some residents say, while fervent supporters — including some state and local elected officials — tend to cast doubters as reactionary NIMBYs. Many residents haven’t made up their minds about nuclear energy in Wyoming, which has triggered debates even among married couples.
WyoFile interviewed a dozen residents during two recent public meetings: One on Sept. 29 at Casper College, and another on Sept. 30 in Gillette, to get a gut-check on the nuclear energy conversation in Wyoming. Though some were decidedly for and some decidedly against various aspects of nuclear energy proposals, their responses were mostly apolitical. They revealed conflicted feelings about potential benefits and risks and much frustration about who to trust for credible answers to endless questions.
Here’s what they said.
Natrona County
About 100 Natrona County residents attended, “Let’s Set The Table — Nuclear 101,” presented by retired uranium mining engineer Wayne Heili. Though the presentation, which included a question-and-answer format, didn’t focus specifically on Radiant’s proposal — which was still active in Wyoming at the time — it was top of mind.
“[Radiant] can come in if it’s the right business for the community,” Bar Nunn resident Chris Hermel told WyoFile. “But the safety issues, to me, have not been addressed — not to my satisfaction.” The company’s assurances regarding safety protocols for transporting radioactive materials in and out of the community, for example, lacked details. “It needs to come with proof, not just somebody saying, ‘It’s safe,’ and ‘Trust me.'”


Radiant Industries
California-based startup Radiant Industries announced plans early this year to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant just outside the town of Bar Nunn, a few miles north of Casper. The community was an ideal location, company officials said, for its existing manufacturing and heavy industry support services — and the fact that Wyoming is already home to uranium mining, which Radiant would eventually tap for its fuel supply chain. 
Radiant’s portable, TRISO-fueled Kaleidos microreactors would be deployed to clients, including the U.S. Military, around the world. When a unit needs refueling, it would be sent back to the manufacturing plant, and the spent fuel would be stored on site and presumably moved to a permanent federal nuclear fuel waste repository if one is built.The plan would require a change to Wyoming’s decades-long ban on spent nuclear fuel waste, which lawmakers considered but so far have not taken action on. The company announced Oct. 13 that it was withdrawing its plans in Wyoming to instead build in Tennessee.


Like many others, Hermel wasn’t convinced that Radiant’s nuclear fuel waste would ever leave the Natrona County facility, noting there is no federal repository. “It seems like they’re trying to rush it through without having all of the details,” he said.
The divide over Radiant and other nuclear energy proposals in Wyoming sometimes includes disagreements within the same household.
Lisa and Wayne Kasparek of Bar Nunn, after listening to Heili’s presentation, challenged each other over the safety of storing spent nuclear fuel near their community.
“If they have so many places that are already storing waste, why can’t the waste be stored at a facility that is already storing it?” Wayne posed to his wife.

“They addressed that in there,” Lisa responded. “They’re looking to possibly have one storage facility,” she said, referring to hopes for a renewed effort to establish a federal nuclear waste repository.
“Yeah, and Wyoming might be it, since we’re wide open and we don’t have a large population,” Wayne said.
Though not opposed to nuclear energy manufacturing, both Kaspareks said they worry about other projects that would generate electricity in Wyoming but ship the power out of the state — like TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant under construction in Kemmerer — fearing it might increase their power bills.

“I want to hear specifics on how it’s going to affect our pocketbook,” Lisa Kasparek said. “I’m comfortable with the safety features because I think we’ve come so far in learning about nuclear power.”
Others lamented what they see as a tendency — including among elected officials — to draw lines for residents to either be for or against nuclear energy, particularly regarding Radiant’s proposal. Lee-Ann Newquist of Bar Nunn, said that tendency to draw lines amplified tensions over the issue in Bar Nunn and left many, including herself, doubtful about who can be considered a trusted, unbiased source of information. 
Rather than town hall meetings organized by elected officials, Newquist said, “maybe set up a citizens committee so we can have a roundtable discussion long before things are actually breaking ground and money is being spent.”

In Gillette, BWXT hosted a public information session, attracting nearly 300 attendees. The company’s director of business development, Joshua Parker, gave a short presentation, and attendees milled around to pose questions to company officials posted around the venue.
DJ Towne brought a notebook with questions and penciled in answers as she visited each station.
“I asked them about worst-case scenarios when you’re transporting the stuff: What happens if?” Towne told WyoFile. “She said there’s required packaging, so that in case of a crash in bad weather, it’s not radioactive.”


BWXT
Lynchburg, Virginia-based BWXT proposes to build a $500 million TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. Construction of the “Category II” plant is expected to begin about a year from now, with an in-service target of 2030, according to the company.
TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of poppyseeds, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. The facility will not produce or store any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel in the state, according to the company. BWXT hopes to eventually tap Wyoming’s uranium mining industry to supply its fuel chain.The Wyoming Energy Authority announced earlier this month that it is recommending a $100 million state grant to support the project.


Towne was still hunting down a BWXT official to answer another question: What kind of tax breaks is the company seeking from the federal and state government? She arrived at the event uncertain about whether she might ultimately support BWXT’s project.
“I just wanted more information before I made a decision,” Towne said. “That’s what a lot of people are here for, to be informed so we don’t misunderstand what it actually is.”
Ronda Boller was equally undecided when she arrived at the event. Though she was there to learn about the proposed nuclear fuel manufacturing facility, she was also wary about a sense of enthusiasm for nuclear energy throughout the community. The town’s long boom-and-bust history instills a sense of desperation, she noted.
“When we get on a boom, we’re like, ‘Let’s run with it,'” Boller said.

That’s what happened with the coal-bed methane boom of the 2000s, she said. Local and state officials eagerly embraced hundreds of companies that flooded into northeast Wyoming, overlooking some important safeguards and long-term implications. “And now the state is stuck filling those wells,” Boller said. 
Millions in taxpayer dollars have been earmarked to clean up more than 2,000 orphaned wells, which can release methane, pollute groundwater and pose other hazards to people and wildlife.
Her advice to fellow residents: “Don’t get greedy. Don’t get in a hurry. Whatever you do, take your time. Make sure you understand everything and don’t think this is the next big boom.
“After watching what happened with [coal-bed methane], you can’t do that with nuclear,” Boller added. “I just want to make sure that if we do this, we do it right and we think it through.”
Kyle Van Lant was among those excited to see the nuclear energy industry come to town.

“This might not be the consensus in Gillette, but I’m a big believer in renewable energy,” the 25-year-old civil engineer said. “I think it’s extremely important that we learn how to balance our carbon output and input, and nuclear energy, I think, is probably the most feasible way for that to happen.”
Van Lant moved to Gillette from Los Angeles two years ago and has become increasingly interested in how the community — famous for its prolific coal, oil, natural gas and uranium production — might adapt to changing energy markets. “So I’ve been learning about nuclear energy and its feasibility in Gillette,” he said. “I’m excited and optimistic. I just hope people are receptive to it.”
Similar to some events in Bar Nunn this year, Van Lant said there were a handful of public meetings in Gillette that he felt were intended to incite fear rather than offer information or answer questions. 
“People were standing up and saying ‘We want experts to talk to us, because this just seems like a scare meeting with nobody actually knowing what’s going on,'” he said. 
Though BWXT’s Sept. 30 event might have included a “certain amount of fluff,” Van Lant said, company officials came with a lot of answers and explanations. “So it will be interesting to hear about how people respond to this.”
While Radiant has exited the discussion in Wyoming, there remains a possibility that nuclear waste storage will get attention during the upcoming legislative budget session, according to lawmakers close to the issue.
Though waste storage is not part of BWXT’s proposal, the Campbell County Board of Commissioners is mulling whether to put the question of spent nuclear fuel waste storage to a public vote next year. Meantime, the commission will not allow any form of spent nuclear fuel waste storage.The public can go to this website to access the draft resolution and comment on it.

Kenah, who occasionally finds horses grazing along the ridge, once found himself without a camera at a moment when the light was hitting the equine beasts just right. 
Determined not to repeat the mistake, he brought his phone along for the ride on an unseasonably warm early October Friday. Sure enough, there were the horses, and there was the light. 
Here’s how he describes getting the shots:“I barely made it for the last light as the sun was dipping behind the mountain — how Sheridanites refer to the Big Horns — to get that warm glow on the horse. The light faded right before I turned to the other three horses, but the waxing gibbous moon and half-lit clouds made a nice backdrop. They all seemed pretty indifferent to my presence and kept munching their grass, so I thanked them for their time and went on my way.”

Wyoming's biggest challenge isn't a lack of opportunity. It's a fear of change. But doing nothing won't save the state we love, writes Josh Dorrell.
The post Wyoming’s future depends on courage, optimism and action appeared first on WyoFile .","Across Wyoming, people are ready to build, grow and move forward. From Rock Springs to Sheridan and Torrington to Powell, there is a growing sense that it is time to stop talking about what is slipping away and focus on what is possible. 

Opinion

A new statewide poll conducted for the Wyoming Business Council confirms this shared belief: Opportunity, good jobs, and the chance for our children and grandchildren to stay close to home are not optional — they are essential. 
The poll shows that most Wyoming voters want their local community to take decisive action to grow jobs and the economy. A clear majority supports responsible population growth when it means more opportunity for families and neighbors. Nearly everyone agrees that retaining young people and attracting new ones is critical for Wyoming’s future. 
In the Cowboy State, decisions mean more when they reflect the voice of the people. Polling helps us listen, not politicize, showing what residents value most, what worries them and what gives them hope. It ensures every community has a seat at the table and captures the collective wisdom, optimism and grounded spirit of Wyoming. 
This data gives us confidence to make the important, and sometimes big, decisions to grow. It shows that most of Wyoming wants progress that fits our values, but also progress that keeps our families rooted here. 
More than half of the respondents have a child, grandchild or family member who has left the state for opportunities elsewhere. That fact hits home for many of us. However, the same poll shows that there is still deep hope and a desire to thrive. People want to see investment in job creation, housing and infrastructure. We want visible progress and responsible leadership. We want results, not excuses.
The greatest obstacle Wyoming faces is not a lack of opportunity. It is fear. Fear of change, conflict and the anxiety of losing the Wyoming we love. That fear often manifests as deeply damaging myths that block our path forward. 
One myth we hold onto is that our economy is just fine, and we have time to wait. The numbers tell a different story. Our state has seen a long-term decline in GDP and we have the highest rate of youth outmigration in the country. We watch businesses and our young people move to other places for better opportunities. Voters are feeling it, citing the cost of living and housing availability as top challenges. This is an urgent situation. 
Too often, those who support new ideas or projects stay quiet when the conversation turns loud or heated. We’ve seen this play out recently across the state. Even when most people support a business or development idea, many stay silent because they do not want to be caught in the crosshairs of controversy. 
That silence has a cost. It pushes opportunity away and tells the next business or investor that Wyoming might not be ready to grow. It sends the wrong message to our young people, who wonder if they can build a life here. 
We have always been pioneers, and our future must be led by a Team of Thousands — local leaders, businesses and partners who are ready to build.
Wyoming has a strong contingent of people who want progress and economic growth. The poll clearly shows that. People understand that our economy faces headwinds, but we are not giving up. We are practical, hopeful and ready to take bold action. 
Our job at the Wyoming Business Council is to help turn that collective optimism into a visible reality. These poll results are a roadmap for building stronger communities. Growth in Wyoming has always started locally. It begins with leadership at the community level and partnerships with the private sector. 
Wyoming residents are not opposed to investment. They simply want to know that their dollars are being used wisely. When local leaders and businesses work together and deliver results that matter, people respond with trust and support. 
We cannot afford to keep losing opportunities, especially when every one of us wants our children and grandchildren to live and thrive in the beauty of Wyoming. The good news is that none of us is alone in that hope. All across this state, there is a shared belief in the potential of Wyoming people and communities. 
There is opportunity everywhere, but we must make our optimism louder than the naysayers. Our challenge is to match belief with courage and take action.
The next chapter of Wyoming’s story will not be written by fear. It must be written by the people who dare to build.

(Getty Images)The private company that runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits is planning to cut pay rates for doctors and health care providers.
Magellan of Idaho, the contractor, plans to cut pay rates for Medicaid mental health services by at least 4% but up to 15% for partial hospitalizations, according to a notice it sent providers earlier this month. 
Idaho Medicaid cuts could force disability providers to close. The state wants to exempt services.

The cuts come after the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates, following Gov. Brad Little’s order for 3% midyear budget cuts across state government as state tax revenues lag behind expectations. Magellan’s cuts appear to be an attempt to offset cuts the company faces from Health and Welfare.
Many of the Medicaid mental health contractor’s cuts are scheduled to take effect in November. That leaves providers little time to plan, and it risks the state losing treatment options, especially in rural areas, said Jason Coombs, founder of Brick House Recovery, a substance abuse treatment center in Boise and Idaho Falls. 
“Idaho’s behavioral health system is built on the shoulders of dedicated providers who continue showing up for individuals and families in need,” he said in a statement. “We recognize that adjustments to Medicaid funding are complex, but they must be implemented in ways that protect continuity of care and sustain the professionals who make that care possible.”

 Idaho is working with managed care organizations to find cuts in contracts

Magellan is one of several private companies, called managed care organizations, that run Medicaid benefits in the state.
Idaho projected to end fiscal year with unconstitutional $56.6M state budget deficit 

In August, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates. The agency said cuts would extend to the state’s payments to managed care organizations, and could turn into “provider rate reductions or changes to optional covered services.”
That came after Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state agencies besides public schools to cut budgets midyear by 3% – which his budget chief directed agencies to extend permanently. 
The cuts were meant to avoid a projected $80 million budget shortfall, which would violate the Idaho Constitution’s requirement for the state to maintain a balanced budget. But projections released earlier this month show Idaho is still projected to have a budget deficit, to the tune of $56.6 million dollars.
It isn’t immediately clear how long Magellan’s cuts will last. 
“Magellan will continue to coordinate with (Health and Welfare) to determine how long these rate reductions must be in place or if other service changes are necessary to ensure a balanced budget,” the company wrote in its notice to providers. “Magellan understands this is a challenging budget situation and we will continue to work with the IBHP provider network to identify additional ways to reduce administrative costs so we can collectively support Idahoans.”

Magellan could not be immediately reached for comment.
The Department of Health and Welfare “has been working with managed care organizations to identify 4% decreases in their contracts,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement. 
 How Idaho Medicaid’s mental health cuts work

On Oct. 2, Magellan notified Idaho Medicaid providers about the contractor’s cuts to pay rates for providers, which include 4% cuts to Diagnosis Related Group hospitals. That cut was made effective starting Sept. 1.
Starting Nov. 1, Magellan said the following cuts would take effect:

15% cuts to partial hospitalizations.
10% cuts to intensive outpatient care.
5% cuts to community-based American Society of Addiction Medicine, or ASAM, programs.
4% cuts to all other services on the contract, which is called the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan, or IBHP.

But some services would be excluded from the cuts, Magellan said, including:

Tribal providers
Children’s residential services
Institution for mental disease hospitals
Critical access hospitals, which are a designation for rural hospitals

David Lehman, a lobbyist for the Idaho Association of Community Providers and Cottonwood Creek Behavioral Hospital, said the impact of the cuts aren’t clear yet. He said he expects Health and Welfare will soon share guidance to providers.
But he thinks more cuts could come from the state.
“It is more likely than not that they’ll want to go deeper, or they’ll need to go deeper with cuts, if they’re not going to leverage the stabilization account that they have set up,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.

(Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)A nonprofit legal organization that has worked on dozens of high-profile lawsuits challenging the actions of President Donald Trump’s administration is representing Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and other local officials in their recently filed lawsuit against Gov. Bill Lee’s deployment of the National Guard in Memphis.
The lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court on Oct. 17, states that Lee “trampled on Tennessee law by unilaterally deploying Tennessee National Guard members in Memphis as a domestic police force,” something the state’s constitution prohibits without approval from the General Assembly. It seeks a temporary injunction to block Tennessee National Guard members from acting in Memphis until the legal challenge is settled. 
Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, and litigation attorney Yenisey Rodriguez spoke alongside Harris and other plaintiffs in a Wednesday news conference.
“The Constitution is clear: No rebellion, no invasion, no deployment. State statutes are clear: No deployment, unless local government requests it or the legislature approves it,” Rodriguez, one of the lead attorneys in the lawsuit, said. “For more than 150 years, Tennessee has rejected the use of military forces to police its own civilians.”
“This isn’t a gray area or a partisan policy disagreement,” Rodriguez said. “This is a direct violation of the state constitution. Our clients have the responsibility to challenge it, and we are honored to be here with them in that challenge.”
Shelby County Mayor, elected officials sue Gov. Bill Lee over National Guard deployment

Democracy Forward formed in 2016 to challenge “threats to democracy and the wellbeing of Americans” in court and has filed more than 710 actions across more than 38 states, including 100 legal actions against Trump’s administration since he returned to office in 2025, according to its website.
Trump established the Memphis Safe Task Force in a presidential memo on Sept. 15, authorizing multiple federal agencies to work with state and local officials to “end street and violent crime in Memphis.” This memo also requested the support of Tennessee National Guard units to “support public safety and law enforcement operations.”
Lee agreed to deploy guardsmen, who joined more than 1,000 members of state and federal law enforcement agencies in Memphis beginning Oct. 10.
Harris said his office was told there are 159 National Guardsmen in Shelby County this week, up from 64 last week. The Tennessee National Guard did not respond to a request for confirmation.
Agencies that make up the task force have yet to release the names and charges of all individuals arrested since the task force’s launch.
Harris on Monday compared booking and bail data from the week of Oct. 6-12 with the data from the same week in 2023 and 2024, showing that both bookings and the number of bail determinations have roughly doubled in comparison. Felony and misdemeanor bail determinations for Oct. 6-12 are also higher this year compared to previous years. 
“We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of folks that have been booked — that is to say, arrested — for misdemeanor offenses,” Harris said.
In 2024, Shelby County courts set bail for 222 felony cases and 162 misdemeanor cases over that 7-day period. This year, the county logged 346 felony bail determinations and 300 misdemeanor bail determinations.

Mayor Harris: Lawsuit solely challenges National Guard deployment
In an earlier news conference on Monday, Harris emphasized that the lawsuit “is about the National Guard and deployment of military personnel, and it is not about the (other agencies that make up the) Memphis Safe Task Force.”
Shelby County officials have previously called for other state and federal agencies to “surge their investment in resources in Memphis and Shelby County,” Harris said. This includes advocating for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab to remain in Shelby County, opposing the removal of the FBI Field Office from the county in December 2024 and pushing for “sensible gun legislation” from the Tennessee state legislature. 
What the city wants is collaboration, Memphis City Council member JB Smiley, Jr., one of the plaintiffs, said Monday.
“We are always prepared to discuss how federal and state resources can help decrease crime in Shelby County that do not involve the National Guard,” Smiley said.
Attorney says more plaintiffs are welcome
The lawsuit was brought by Harris, state Rep. Gabby Salina and Rep. G.A. Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats, state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, Shelby County Commissioners Erika Sugarmon and Henri E. Brooks, and Smiley.

The suit names Lee, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Tennessee National Guard Major General Warner Ross III as defendants. 
Harris clarified Monday that the City of Memphis was not asked to join the lawsuit.
The lawsuit has underscored the different approaches taken by the Shelby County mayor and Memphis Mayor Paul Young in responding to the task force’s presence.
At an Oct. 20 town hall hosted by Vecindarios 901, Young said his strategy “has been and continues to be to keep this task force focused on violent crime as opposed to immigration.” This includes embedding task force members into Memphis Police Department units including organized crime and homicide.
Young said he does not think the lawsuit is “going to stand the legal test.”
“It’s not something that the city’s going to be involved in,” he said.
On Wednesday, Harris said he did not have any comments about the City of Memphis “signing on or not signing on.”
Rodriguez, one of the lawsuit’s lead attorneys, said the plaintiffs believe they have the “appropriate parties” to “seek the relief that’s needed here, and we welcome any of those who are interested in participating in our lawsuit moving forward.”
Attorney addresses lawsuit’s scope
Attorneys for the plaintiffs on Wednesday said they are not concerned about Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal’s denial of a separate request for a preliminary injunction, which sought to stop National Guard activity before the lawsuit’s first hearing on Nov. 3.
“We really do believe the court will be fair in hearing all parties, and we have no concern that a denied (preliminary injunction) — from our experience in many other cases across the country — indicates any weakness in our case or anything about the future of this legislation,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez also addressed the lawsuit’s limited scope, in light of previous remarks from Harris and other officials about potential racial profiling during task force traffic stops.
“We know there are many issues here, and there’s many ways to tackle them,” she said. “That’s just simply not our lawsuit. We pursued the claims that we thought we could at this moment, and we are definitely committed to working on —  with all our coalition partners both locally and nationally — to figure out what other issues we can tackle.”
Harris said Monday that he has heard “troubling actions on the part of those that have been deployed to Memphis and Shelby County” as part of the task force, but he has yet to receive a response from the task force’s leaders. 
“We would love to hear some sort of response about what they’re doing to address these anecdotal claims that there has been (racial) profiling since the deployment,” Harris said, adding that he would like to see daily reports with demographic data.
“We don’t want to make claims around what is happening without information,” he said.

(Photo by Liz Cartwright for the Idaho Capital Sun) POCATELLO — The sagebrush steppe land that covers the hills around Pocatello and many parts of the Western U.S. is a beautiful, diverse landscape; it is also shrinking at a rapid rate due to drought associated with climate change, overgrazing by cattle and increasingly intense wildfires. Cheatgrass and other invasive species fuel wildfires that damage habitats and human-built structures. 
The Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust has teamed up with the Idaho Goat Grazers to test an age-old, organic method of weed control — grazing goats. 
The Century Heights portion of the land trust is made up of 266 acres of land in Bannock County that has been under its care since 2018. According to the land trust’s website, its mission is to “… protect, connect, and enhance wildlife habitat, working lands, and community spaces in Southeast Idaho, now and for future generations. Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust works with willing landowners in Southeast Idaho to conserve private land by creating tailored agreements, known as conservation easements, to protect land while keeping it in private ownership.”

This land trust area is essential grazing land for the large herds of mule deer that migrate across southeast Idaho. This makes the Century Heights land ideal for being in the trust.
“We look for land that connects wildlife migration routes,” said Carly Flandro, a spokesperson for the Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust.
 Idaho goats expertly take on cheatgrass, other invasive plant species

In recent years, cheatgrass has proliferated in the region, and the land trust has been searching for the best means of controlling that invasive species. 
Zachary Copeland of Idaho Goat Grazers has been working with the Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust for several months using his goats to clean up the cheatgrass and other invasive species.

Earlier this year, Copeland’s herd of 70 Spanish goats grazed the upper ravines of the spring growth of cheatgrass. Now, in late October the herd is back to graze the lower ravines of Century Heights. 
“We are trying to see how the cheatgrass handles spring grazing versus fall grazing and see how much of it we can eliminate,” Copeland said.  
“The reason we are doing this now, is that cheatgrass is invasive and germinates in the fall, whereas the other native plants don’t germinate until the spring,” said Hannah Clawson, Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust’s stewardship coordinator. “So cheatgrass gets a huge head start which is why it is so prolific.”
On the beautiful fall afternoon when I met with Zachary and representatives from the land trust, the goats were having a great time doing their job. In a few hours, they cleaned up large swathes of Century Heights, leaving behind only a much safer environment and a bit of goat fertilizer.

Goats are particularly good at destroying the cheatgrass because of “the way they chew their cud, it breaks up the seeds better than other animals,” Copeland told me. 
In other settings, herbicides like glyphosate (Roundup-ultra) are used to control cheatgrass. These chemicals are dangerous to human health and the health of all living creatures that come in contact with them according to a 2022 systematic review of the scientific literature. There appears to be a strong linkage between glyphosate and some cancers, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders, according to another 2022 scientific review in the journal Environmental Research. 
Finding ways to combat noxious weeds in a manner that is not harmful to our planet is increasingly important as humans live more closely intertwined with natural spaces and as our planet continues warming. 
Using goat grazing to control cheatgrass is a positive step forward in creating a sustainable, safe and healthy environmental solution for this invasive species problem.

(Thanasis Zovoilis | Getty Images)When Casey Russell visited her Clarksburg food pantry on Tuesday, items were already becoming scarce. She didn’t receive the normal amount of food, like fresh meat and canned goods, she relies to help feed three grandchildren and one great-grandchild who she raises full time. 
She also depends on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, but that money for food won’t come late this month due to the federal government shut down. 
“I’m very scared,” said Russell, 55, who adopted the four children in 2021. “I’m just going to try to go to different food pantries if I can. It’s hard for me because I don’t drive, so I have to find a ride. I just may not be able to pay some bills because of it to buy food, you know?”
About 270,000 — or one in six — West Virginia residents use SNAP benefits, including people 60 and older who qualify for the federal food stamp program. 
Half of all SNAP households in the state have a disabled or elderly member — a higher rate than the national average.
“I think it’s going to greatly affect quite a few of our seniors,” said Beverly Fitzgerald, executive director of the Harrison County Senior Center. 
The West Virginia Department of Human Services posted on social media that delays in issuing SNAP benefits for October should be expected. 
Asked whether the state could foot the bill to cover SNAP benefits, Drew Galang, spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey, said that West Virginia and other states do not have the money to shoulder the costs of the federal program. He blamed Senate Democrats for the “Schumer shutdown.” 
“The solution is simple: Senate Democrats can vote to pass a clean [continuing resolution] — the same one they voted to pass 13 times under Joe Biden — at any time to reopen the government and prevent further delays to SNAP benefits,” Galang wrote in an email.
He went on to encourage residents to use Family Resource Network centers and food pantries and to contact their caseworker for help finding resources. On Thursday, Morrisey said he’d expedite money to food pantries that was previously appropriated by the Legislature earlier this year. No new state money has been granted for pantries at this time. 
In Harrison County, Fitzgerald said that increased food prices have affected the senior center’s ability to keep its food pantry shelves full. Seniors rely on the pantry and its food boxes, she said, because SNAP already doesn’t cover their monthly food needs.
“We’re probably going to see an increase in people coming to the pantry for food,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t know if we can meet the need.”
Many grandparents in West Virginia are raising their grandkids 
West Virginia has a large number of grandparents raising grandchildren; it’s largely due to the state’s drug epidemic.
More than 100,000 SNAP recipients in West Virginia are children.
C. Sergent, 58, has legal custody of two grandchildren who are 2 and 15 years old. The children receive SNAP benefits.
“I don’t know how I’m going to feed my family,” she said. “Because we already struggle, and this is going to make it worse. All of the Senate and all of these people in Washington are not understanding.”
Hanna Thurman is executive director of the Healthy Grandfamilies program, a free program housed at West Virginia State University that provides information and resources to grandparents raising grandchildren. The organization doesn’t collect information about who is using SNAP.
“Grandparents are already on a fixed income and face food insecurity often,” Thurman said. “This just makes it all the more difficult to make the choices that they’re having to make between food and medicine and utilities.”
She also noted that many grandparents they work with don’t have cars to access in-person food pickups. 
Bobbi Holland, a board member for Meals on Wheels Inc. of Charleston, said the organization serves about 50 people in the city, and is at capacity. She expects she may get calls from people because of the delay in SNAP benefits, but the organization can’t take on many more individuals. 
“We would love to do more but we are struggling to get volunteers,” Holland said. “We’ve been going over 50 years, but it’s getting harder and harder.”
SNAP benefits delay likely to continue into November 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, said Thursday that she doesn’t think the government shutdown will end by the Nov. 1 deadline.

The delay in SNAP benefits is very likely to stretch into next month, according to Department of Human Services.
Capito told MetroNews earlier this week that Republicans are willing to negotiate with Democrats over health insurance premiums, but that not while the government is “held hostage.” Democrats want “guaranteed results” that are an unreasonable ask, she said.
She added that people no longer getting SNAP and other federal benefits may be the “pressure point” needed to open the government.
“It’s sad in a way it has to come to that point but in a way we’ve got to have something that’s going to pop the bubble, and so this could be it,” Capito said. 
At issue are subsidies that help thousands of West Virginians afford health insurance that would expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them. 
According to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the 67,000 West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace would see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually if the subsidies are not extended. About 15,000 West Virginians would lose their health care because they can no longer afford it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy. 
The McDowell County Commission on Aging, which serves seniors in the state’s poorest county, is preparing for possible increased need due to the SNAP benefits delay, according to executive director Donald Reed.
They’d already seen an increase lately in seniors eating at the center due to the grocery prices, he said. The center provides a free hot meal to more than 200 seniors on weekdays.
“If those benefits don’t hit, we are prepared to feed those additional people who show up,” Reed said.

It was her MI Bridges app — the site through which state benefits are provided — alerting her that her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, would not be sent to her in November due to the federal government shutdown.
“What went through my head at that moment is like, ‘Wow, they’re really gonna do this to families that’s trying to feed their children,’” she said. “It just made me just go into a panic. I actually had an anxiety attack.”
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services formally announced later Thursday morning that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has instructed them to cease payment of SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing federal shutdown. 
Now, concerns like Wilkes’s are front of mind for many of the approximately 1.4 million people in Michigan receiving SNAP benefits, about 43% of whom are families with children and 36% with members of the family who are older adults or disabled.

By definition, SNAP benefits do not allow recipients to save up for emergencies such as this.
“Benefits really aren’t all that much money,” Elinor Jordan, a public benefits law attorney at the Michigan Poverty Law Project, explained. “Every little bit is deducted. The families cannot have any cushion or their SNAP benefits would be reduced based on that cushion.”
So, as Wilkes said, “What do they expect us to do?”
State Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said that the change is “going to trigger all the folks at the state and the local governments, and then community action agencies and nonprofits, to start to scramble for what they can do to try to make sure that folks who are depending upon SNAP for food aren’t going without, aren’t literally starving.”
As Irwin suggested, some might expect food banks and food pantries to fill in these gaps. However, Phil Knight, executive director of the Food Bank Council of Michigan, explained that food banks are meant to “supplement, not substitute” food assistance. 
“Asking charity to be the safety net to the government safety net? It’s just back-ass-ward to me,” he said. 
Jordan experienced this firsthand when her family was volunteering at their church’s food bank over the weekend — before the SNAP pause was officially announced, but as it was becoming more likely that it might happen as the federal government shutdown stretched on. 
With about 90 families still in line, she said, the food bank ran out of food.

Knight noted that the changes to SNAP will not change the purpose of Michigan’s food banks, and that they will continue to do everything that they are able.
“The mission of the Feeding America food banks here in Michigan doesn’t change,” he said. “We’re always going to come alongside our neighbors, because we’re convinced they are people worthy of investment, not necessarily a problem to be solved.”
“But I’m just trying to temper expectations, that when you pull $15 billion a month out of a national economy and expect charity to step in and nobody miss a beat,” Knight added. “That’s unrealistic.”
Many advocates were highly critical of President Donald Trump and his administration for making the decision to cut funding. 
“As this rogue administration prioritizes tax breaks for billionaires, they’re simultaneously stripping away basic healthcare, food, and social services from those who need them most,” wrote Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Detroit-based Mothering Justice, in a statement. 
“This administration is targeting the single parents already stretching every dollar, the seniors choosing between groceries and medicine, and the workers earning too little to make ends meet in an economy stacked against them,” Atkinson continued. “Now, because of political games being played in Congress, they’re being told to wait. Lawmakers working in support of pausing SNAP will be responsible when our kids go hungry.”
And Rep. Sharon MacDonell (D-Troy) wrote to the Michigan Advance, “With President Trump claiming that the federal shutdown gives him authority to unilaterally cancel ‘Democrat programs’, I have little doubt that his administration is pausing SNAP payments because it wants to, not because it has to.”
Others called on him to activate contingency measures — including over $5 billion in funding that was appropriated in 2024 and 2025 to act as a reserve fund for SNAP specifically, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The group estimated a month of full benefits to cost around $8 billion.
Shutdown likely to halt food benefits for 42 million in just days

“This pause and benefits is entirely avoidable. The federal government has both the authority and the tools to keep SNAP funds flowing,” Julie Cassidy, a senior policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, said. 
“We shouldn’t be making this false choice between funding food assistance and making sure people can still afford their health insurance premiums,” she added, with Affordable Care Act credits being a major piece of Congressional Democrats’ resistance to the budget. 
Partisan finger-pointing offers little comfort
As the shutdown stretches on, elected officials in both parties pointed fingers at the other side of the aisle to blame for the lack of a federal budget. 
State Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) wrote to the Advance, “Of course I can’t speak to why Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have shut down the government.”
Lindsey also added concerns about SNAP funding more broadly — concerns that are shared by high-level Trump officials, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on what food is eligible to be purchased with SNAP. 
“It looks like the silver lining here is that the billions of SNAP dollars, which all come from taxpayers, will not be spent subsidizing junk food for a period of time,” Lindsey wrote.
And after posting resources, including lists of food banks, on her Facebook page, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Alto) added a line — in response to a commenter’s suggestion — reading, “Tell Senator Elissa Slotkin and Senator Gary Peters to vote to reopen the federal government!”
Meanwhile, Rep. Natalie Price (D-Berkley) said she didn’t accept the contention that Democrats were responsible for the current situation.
“This is fully the Republicans making the shutdown, and they need to stop trying to place blame. I think Michiganders are smarter than to buy that,” Price said.
Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress as well as control the White House.
“Hopefully, the Republicans who run Congress and who are sitting in the office of the President get a budget done and get these funds out to the people who need them,” Irwin added. 










Lawmakers working in support of pausing SNAP will be responsible when our kids go hungry.

But the long-term effects of the shutdown and the resulting SNAP pause are more than political. By law, Cassidy explained, all the benefits not received at this time should come to SNAP recipients once a budget is signed and SNAP funding is flowing again. 
Jennifer Garner, a professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan, explained how any lapse in SNAP funding, especially if it becomes extended, can have lasting economic and health impacts.. 
“When we are in times of uncertainty like this, when we don’t know what our food resources are going to look like in the weeks and months to come, it is not unreasonable to hedge your bets by focusing on shelf-stable foods that will last a long time,” she said. “And so that’s where compromises nutritionally can come into play.”
Without SNAP funding, recipients will have less capacity to purchase fresh foods — including through programs like the Double Up Food Bucks program, which allows SNAP dollars to be spent in places like farmer’s markets. 
“We’ve been working hard over the past decade to create these bridges between SNAP participants and direct to consumer markets, and that benefits local farmers, and that specifically benefits farmers who are selling produce, growing and selling produce, which is important to support that segment of our agricultural economy,” Garner explained. “When SNAP is paused, folks can’t engage in models like that.”
That hurts farmers, as well as local grocery stores and local retailers. 
“For every dollar spent in food assistance, there’s $1.80 generated in economic activity, and a lot of that goes to our local communities, our Michigan businesses,” Price said. “This is an irresponsible, harmful decision that goes against the things that the administration claims they’re doing with these cuts.”
But for Knight at the Food Bank Council, despite any difficulties ahead, he remains encouraged by the people visiting his food bank. 
“They’re resilient, they’re smart, they’re dealing with a lot of things in life with less resources than most of us,” he said. “To be very candid, they have my admiration.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The U.S. government shutdown is affecting everything from state unemployment reports to food stamps and the judiciary, forcing U.S. Attorney’s offices in Tennessee to scale back workers while causing a bit of sniping by state lawmakers.
House Democrats are asking Gov. Bill Lee to call a special session to approve funding for federal food and energy programs as 690,000 Tennesseans face the prospects of losing November benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, if feds drag out the budget stalemate.
“We, as state officials, have a duty to step up and lead so that innocent children and disabled and low-income adults do not go hungry or lose vital aid when our state has the means to help them,” Rep. John Ray Clemmons, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a Thursday statement.
They made their request of the governor following a report that Lee and Republican leaders said they wouldn’t fill the funding gap.
Clemmons backed up his argument by saying Lee called special sessions to create a private-school voucher program, approve a “third-grade retention” bill, address public safety after The Covenant School shooting, set up a Megasite Authority and fund BlueOval City and try to deal with COVID measures. Why not help poor people?
Lee’s office didn’t respond to questions Thursday. A word to the wise: Don’t hold your breath while waiting.
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

Besides the SNAP snafu, Tennessee couldn’t file its September unemployment report this week because of the spending stalemate in Washington, D.C. 
People on unemployment will continue to receive benefits through the state’s Unemployment Insurance Program. But federal workers placed on furlough are being encouraged to file on the state’s website to expedite the process. The state’s trust fund has a balance of $1.5 billion.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in West Tennessee is among those sending employees home, except for personnel exempt from work restrictions during an appropriations lapse, according to information obtained by the Lookout.
Citizens “can be assured” that essential federal law enforcement, criminal prosecution and national security functions will keep going without interruption, the office says. That includes handling cases brought by the Memphis Safe Task Force operation.
U.S. Attorney Mike Dunavant “is not otherwise currently available for a public comment,” the statement says.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nashville couldn’t be reached this week for comment to see if it’s undertaking the same furlough program, likely because of the mandated layoffs. 
(In a former life, we called this “fur-cation, even though it wasn’t very funny.)
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, laid the blame for the shutdown at the feet of Democrats in the U.S. Senate.
“It’s a simple extension of the existing budget, and I’m tired of the Democrats playing political games with our nation, and a lot of people are going to be hurt by that,” Johnson said.
 
The U.S. Senate is short of the 60 votes it needs to approve the spending measure. Democrats and independents are using that to broker a deal extending health insurance tax credits and reversing Trump’s Medicaid reductions to the poor, elderly and disabled in the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Memphis Sen. London Lamar doesn’t see eye to eye with Johnson, pointing out Democrats don’t control any branch of the federal government.
“The problem is you’ve got members of the Republican Party who do not agree with the budget bill in front of them because so many of their constituents, business owners, independent contractors, all of these working-class, middle-class folks are also on the Affordable Care Act, who are dependent on this healthcare system to allow them to access essential care,” said Lamar, chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
The big bill threatens 22 million people’s healthcare insurance.
Tossing out the first pitch
The legislature’s new Ways and Means Committee approved acceptance Thursday of a $26 million federal grant to provide services for crime victims.
In its inaugural meeting, the panel received a relative softball. Who’s going to vote against helping people who’ve been robbed or beaten?
The committee took testimony from the Office of Criminal Justice Programs, District Attorneys Conference and other crime victim advocates, who described the necessity of accepting the grant funds for people who, otherwise, would be traumatized as much by the criminal justice system as they were by the crime. Nonprofit agencies receive the majority of the money to provide services such as helping victims at crime scenes, putting them in domestic violence shelters and sitting with them in court.
Lawmakers created the committee this year after legislation was floated that would have required review of every single dollar the feds send this way. Ultimately, they settled on grants exceeding $25 million.
Considering federal funds make up at least 35% of Tennessee’s $59.5 billion budget, this committee has plenty of work ahead. 
One jaded character surmised that lawmakers simply needed another day’s worth of committees so they could collect per diem in the off season.
Looking for money
Two lawmakers joined the group, Make Our Schools Safe Tennessee, this week in the Capitol to push for full funding of Alyssa’s Law.
Adopted on a limited basis, the law is designed to equip school personnel with silent push-button alarms they can use to alert police in case of a shooting, fight or other type of serious disturbance.

Only a couple of school districts are putting the alarm devices to use this year in a pilot program. But Senate Majority Leader Johnson and Rep. Ron Gant said they want to expand the program to every public school statewide.
The law is named for Alyssa Alhadeff, a child killed in the 2018 Parkland Middle School shooting. Several states, including New Jersey, Florida and New York, adopted versions of the measure, but it’s just catching on here.
Holly Walker, co-founder of the school safety group, said the problem took on personal meaning for her seven years ago when she received a text that her niece was in a lockdown at Parkland Middle School with an active shooter on the loose at the nearby high school.
She felt the same way in March 2023 when six people, including three 9-year-olds, were killed at The Covenant School in Nashville.
“Every parent deserves confidence that their child’s school is prepared” for such emergencies, Walker said.
Gant acknowledged the biggest hurdle would be securing funding from the legislature for the panic alarms, which are expected to cost $16,000 per school, about $28.8 million for the state’s 1,800 public schools. 
The plan doesn’t call for putting them in private schools. But since the state is spending $144 million to send 20,000 students to private schools this year, shouldn’t it be just as concerned about their safety as it is about the kids in public schools? 
Funding private and charters
Barely into the state’s first year of a private-school voucher program, a new nonprofit entity called Tennessee Leads is setting lofty goals that would empty the state’s traditional public schools. The dark-money group can lobbying and spend as much as it wants on political campaigns.
Some 20,000 students are receiving $7,300 to attend private schools this year, and another 4,400 attend charter schools, which are considered public but are run by private groups.
Clearly that’s not enough.
Tennessee Leads wants 200,000 vouchers by 2031 and 250,000 students in charter schools. This would leave the state with about 550,000 students in traditional public schools.
Yet it would spend more money if it continues to pay school districts to offset the cost of losing students with vouchers to private schools. 
During debate on the initial Education Savings Account for low-income students six years ago, opponents said approving it would put the camel’s nose under the tent. If this group has its way, the camel will be carrying the tent on its hump.

As part of this broader effort, 70 employees across all divisions are affected through a combination of position eliminations, retirements, resignations and reassignments. This total does not include the six positions announced last month.
These personnel changes were not made lightly. They came after thoughtful consideration by division vice presidents, other University administrators and supervisors of needs and priorities. These decisions are rooted in the responsibility we all share to make choices that strengthen the University’s future.
Supervisors will meet with affected employees on Friday. I know this is an uncertain and emotional time and this news will certainly deepen that anxiety. We have chosen to share this information now to give our community time to process and to ensure that communication happens with care.
Each affected employee has contributed to the life and mission of this University. We are grateful for their service to our students, colleagues and community. We are committed to treating every individual with compassion, respect and support throughout this transition.
Our work is not finished, however. We must now address the remaining $5 million of the structural deficit and begin tackling the University’s recurring debt of approximately $25 million. To do so, we have established a target of $15 million in additional reductions over the coming months – enough to erase the remaining deficit and begin resolving the first $10 million of our recurring debt. This step is essential to achieving financial stability and positioning UL Lafayette for long-term health and growth.
As we navigate this period of challenge, our dedication to the University’s mission remains unwavering. We will continue to focus on teaching, research and service to the community and state, taking each next step with steadiness and purpose. Because ultimately, what defines this University is not the challenges we face, but how we face them. We have met difficult times before and emerged stronger. And we will again.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UL-Lafayette-sign-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 06:17:54.074992

Despite moving up to Class 5A, the Bulldogs have out-scored opponents 282-62","Knolyn Bailey, a bright-eyed, just-turned-16-year-old, 10th grade running back, has grown up attending football games at Lanier High where his mother teaches. Most years, he says, there was little to cheer where the Bulldogs were concerned.
Rick Cleveland
“We usually got blown out,” Bailey says. “It was a sight to see, not in a good way.”
That’s an understatement. Four of the last 15 Lanier football seasons have been winless. During the first four years of Bailey’s life, the Bulldogs lost 38 consecutive games. Lanier, traditionally a basketball powerhouse with 17 state championships, has won only three football playoff games in school history and has never made it past the second round of the playoffs.
And that brings us to one of the most startling developments in Jackson Public Schools football history. The current Lanier Bulldogs are a perfect 8-0 heading into a Friday night showdown at Florence. Despite moving up to Class 5A, the Bulldogs have out-scored opponents 282-62. Bailey has run for 1,540 yards and 15 touchdowns.

Surely, Richard Wright, the famous author and a Lanier grad, would have loved to write this story. Lanier, the proud little school on Maple Street, celebrates its 100th year of existence with its best football team ever.  You can’t miss the biggest – and I mean, BIGGEST reason – for this sudden success. He is 6-feet, 6-inch, 315-pound Tommy Kelly, the former Mississippi State and NFL standout, who towers over nearly all his Lanier players.
Says Knolyn Bailey, a smart young man who already attends some college classes at Tougaloo, “Coach Kelly changed the culture here. He has given us structure.”
In the three seasons prior to Kelly’s Lanier arrival in 2024, the Bulldogs won only seven games while losing 24. In 2024, Kelly’s first Bulldogs finished 8-3 and made the Class 4A playoffs. The current eight-game win streak is the longest in school history.
First question: How did this happen?
“Discipline and structure,” Kelly answers. “What can I say? The kids have bought in. At every level of football I played, I learned from some great coaches. I try to coach these kids the way I was coached, and besides that I have a really good coaching staff.”
Second question: Why in the world is a man who once signed a $50 million NFL contract coach a high school football team for about $60,000 a year? Clearly, he doesn’t need the money.

“My players ask me that sometimes,” Kelly says. “The answer is I’ve always wanted to coach, even back when I was playing high school ball at Provine, I knew I was someday gonna coach. This is what I’ve wanted to do my whole life. This is my dream.
“You know, I played for Willie Collins, a great coach, at Provine. I played for Jackie Sherrill, a great coach, at State. I played for coaches like Bill Belichick and Bruce Arians in the pros. I’ve learned from all of them. It’d be a shame to waste all that.”
Both Collins and Wayne Brent, who coached Kelly in basketball at Provine, remember him as a teen-aged sports junkie. Says Brent, “In my 35 years of coaching, I’ve never had another one like Tommy. He knew everything there was to know about players and teams in all the sports. He was a sports encyclopedia.”

Basketball was Kelly’s first love and he played on Provine’s state championship teams. After playing football and basketball as a freshman, he concentrated on basketball as a sophomore and junior before finally returning to football as a senior, graduating in 1999. He instantly became a highly valued college football recruit. Nick Saban came to Provine from Michigan State to recruit him. Virtually every school in the country wanted him. He committed to Ole Miss first before eventually winding up at State, where Sherrill called him “a diamond in the rough who just needs to be polished.”
Sherrill now says he isn’t the least surprised by Kelly’s success as a coach. “He was very smart, especially when it came to football,” Sherrill says. “He picked up things easily.”

Kelly came to Lanier from Provine, where he was the defensive line coach and coordinator for his alma mater. And this will give you another idea of Kelly’s impact: In 2023, his last year there, Provine beat Lanier 40-0. But Kelly’s first Lanier team beat Provine 16-6 and, this season Lanier routed Provine 30-8.
Says Kelly, “I am still a Provine fan 364 days a year, but not on the day we play them.”
Darrell Roberts, a 16-year-old junior and Lanier’s starting quarterback and safety, has experienced the remarkable transformation of Lanier Bulldogs football.
“The year before Coach Kelly got here, we weren’t locked in as a team,” Roberts says. “We had a lot of guys who didn’t care about football. There’s just a lot more discipline now, at lot more focus on football.”
Jamison Kelly, a 17-year-old senior running back and cornerback, doesn’t know anything about Lanier football before Tommy Kelly. All the other Bulldogs call Tommy Kelly “Coach.” Jamison Kelly calls him “Dad.”
Jamison transferred to Lanier from Madison Central, where he had started at safety as a sophomore. Jamison, one of several Bulldogs who play both offense and defense, has committed to play college football at Southern Illinois. He expects to play a lot more Lanier football first.
“I believe we can go all the way to the state championship. I really do,” Jamison says.
At Lanier, Jamison and his teammates practice on a hardscrabble, unkempt and un-lined field, bare in some areas and ankle-high in weeds in others. They lift weights in shifts because of the weight room is so small.

“It’s what we got,” says Tommy Kelly. “You gotta make do with what you’ve got. We just go with it. I think it motivates our guys when we go to other places and see the nice facilities they have. We play with a chip on our shoulder.”
Knolyn Bailey, the sophomore who takes college classes and scores touchdowns in bunches, has had the opportunity to transfer to private schools where the facilities are much nicer. He has remained at Lanier where his friends are and where Kelly teaches life lessons.
Bailey remembers making a critical defensive mistake last year as a freshman and returning to the sideline to face Coach Kelly. Instead of a tongue lashing, he got a huge arm around his shoulder and a softly spoken but matter-of-fact explanation of what he did wrong and what he should do instead the next time.
“It’s tough love you get from Coach Kelly,” Bailey says. “He can be funny, but when it’s time to work, it’s time to work, and we work. We plan to go all the way. Why not?”
Besides Florence Friday night, Lanier has games remaining with Cleveland Central and Vicksburg. None of the three figures to be easy. Should the Bulldogs get to the Class 5A playoffs, the likes of traditional powerhouses West Point, South Jones and Brookhaven would stand in the way.

Tommy Kelly says he loves the fact that his players believe they can compete with anybody and win a championship.
“You gotta believe in yourself,” he says. “You gotta believe in your dreams.”
He should know. He dreamed of being a pro football star and making millions. He did.
He dreamed of becoming a winning high school coach. He has. He dreamed of coaching his son. He is.
His football hero in high school was Warren Sapp. He wound up playing beside him as an Oakland Raider for four seasons.
“Can you believe that?” Kelly says. 
Yes. It’s a lot easier to believe that than believe this sudden transformation of Lanier football.

Scott Perry (R-10th District) and Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson (U.S. House photo/Stelson campaign)For the first time in the 2026 cycle, a Democratic challenger in Pennsylvania has outraised an incumbent in what is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched U.S. House races in the country.
Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former television anchor in central Pennsylvania, raised $1.24 million from the beginning of July to the end of September, nearly doubling the haul of GOP U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District) over the past three months. She raised more than any other 2026 U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania during the third quarter and is the only one to raise over $1 million in the latest finance report.
Perry, who is currently serving his seventh term in Congress, raised just under $650,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September.
In 2024, Perry defeated Stelson by 1.2 points, which was his closest race since winning a seat in Congress representing southcentral Pennsylvania.
Listen to John and Emily’s audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23epjcQ3.mp3
 
Christopher Borick, director of Muhlenberg College’s Institute of Public Opinion, said he believes the close race last year gives Stelson a pitch that with a different national environment, Democrats think they can flip the seat.
“That’s a big quarter for her and a sign of her strength in this race,” Borick told the Capital-Star.
However, Borick added that Perry, whose three-month haul is the third highest among Pennsylvania U.S. House candidates over the last three months, is also strong.
“If it wasn’t juxtaposed against Stelson, you might say, ‘Okay, he’s in a good position,’” Borick said. “But when you lose to a challenger by basically twice the amount, that should be some warning signs for you that you’re probably going to have to do better.”
Stelson, who formally declared for the seat in July, is supported by a number of elected officials, including Gov. Josh Shapiro. Perry, a former chairman of the conservative U.S. House Freedom Caucus who backed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has the president’s support.
Although a rematch may be in the cards between Perry and Stelson, there are other candidates in the race on both sides.
Two Democrats, Dauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas and Army veteran Will Lillich, have entered the picture.
Douglas, who filed paperwork to run for the seat on Sept. 8, raised $55,000 from that point until the end of the month, while spending $5,000. Lillich did not file a campaign finance report for Q3.
Isabelle Harman, an Army veteran and registered Independent, raised $16,000 since entering the race in September, which includes a loan of just under $14,000 she gave to her campaign.
Republican Karen Dalton, an attorney who worked for the state House GOP caucus, registered to primary Perry for the nomination. She has not filed a campaign finance report yet.
Despite the strong quarter from Stelson, Perry entered October with a cash on hand advantage. Perry entered Q4 with $1.35 million on hand, while Stelson had just under $970,000, and Douglas had $50,000 on hand.
The Cook Political Report rates the race in the 10th as a “toss-up.”

Street jumps out to early fundraising lead in race to replace U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans
Multiple Philadelphia lawmakers posted strong numbers in the first fundraising report filed since U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) announced he wasn’t seeking reelection in 2026.
State Sen. Sharif Street, former chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, led the way by raising just over $350,000, while state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) finished with the second highest figure by bringing in just over $255,000 during the same stretch.
Rep. Morgan Cephas, chair of the Philadelphia Caucus in the state House, raised $155,000 from the beginning of September when she launched her candidacy to the end of the month.
As of Oct. 20, nine Democratic Party candidates have filed to run for the Philadelphia-based seat, which is more than any other U.S. House race in Pennsylvania.
Borick, noting it’s a safe Democratic district, said the crowded field for the Democratic nomination is not a surprise, given the winner will likely be determined by the primary election.
Although the three members of the state General Assembly raised the most this quarter, there were other candidates that filed fundraising reports.
Dave Oxman, a physician, raised just under $110,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September. Karl Morris, a professor at Temple University, brought in just under $40,000, which includes a $10,000 loan he gave to his campaign.
Entering October, Street’s campaign also had the most cash on hand with just over $370,000. Oxman has the second highest with slightly more than $330,000 on hand, followed by Rabb’s $180,000, Cephas having just under $120,000, and Morris with just over $10,000.
Several candidates have not submitted a campaign finance report yet, including Robin Toldens, who the Philadelphia Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, Cole Carter, a software engineer, Isaiah T Martin III, and Dr. Ala Stanford, founder of the Black Doctors Consortium. 
PA7: Mackenzie continues to outpace challengers as Crosswell leads Dem
U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District) continues to outraise the crowded Democratic field, although the fundraising gap is starting to narrow in comparison to previous quarters.
Mackenzie, a freshman lawmaker who defeated U.S. Rep. Susan Wild (D-Lehigh) by 1 point in 2024, raised just over $455,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September.
Of the five Democrats running for their party’s nomination, Ryan Crosswell, a former federal prosecutor, is leading the fundraising race. His campaign raised roughly $380,000 over the last three months. It’s the second quarter in a row in which Crosswell has raised more than his Democratic competitors.
Democratic 7th Congressional District candidate Ryan Crosswell (Crosswell for Congress)
Bob Brooks, a firefighters union leader, brought in the second most among Democrats in the race with just under $310,000 from his campaign launch in late August to the end of September.
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure took in just under $230,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September, which includes a $200,000 loan he gave to his campaign. Carol Obando-Derstine, who worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, raised just under $125,000 over the last three months, while Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley picked up just over $70,000 from his campaign launch in late July to the end of September.
Of the four seats that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is targeting to flip in Pennsylvania next year, Mackenzie has drawn the most Democratic challengers.
Noting how the 7th District race was one of the closest in the nation in 2024, coupled with the moderate history of the Lehigh Valley, Borick believes that’s the reason Democrats have a lot of interest in this seat.
“They have lots of excitement that this is exactly the type of seat that they may be able to flip in a cycle like this,” Borick said.
Mackenzie entered Q4 with a cash on hand advantage over the rest of his challengers, with $1.43 million.
Crosswell entered October with just under $435,000, which is more than any other Democratic candidate in the race.
McClure started Q4 with just under $290,000, with Brooks close behind with  just under $245,000 on hand. Obando-Derstine entered Q4 with a little under $130,000 and Pinsley began October about $55,000.
Like the 10th Congressional District, this race is also a “toss-up,” according to The Cook Political Report.

Fundraising race for PA8 under way: Bresnahan brings in $600K, Cognetti $500K
U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District) raised just under $600,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September, while spending nearly $390,000.
His haul for the quarter leads the candidates running for the northeast Pennsylvania district, although a Democratic challenger has entered the field and submitted her first campaign finance report.

Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, raised $500,000 since she launched her campaign in early September to the end of the month and spent just over $55,000.
Bresnahan is serving his first term in Congress after defeating incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Lackawanna) by roughly 1.5 points in 2024.
Borick believes Democrats are excited about Cognetti’s candidacy and raising a half million dollars in one month shows that funders and contributors are starting to show support for her bid.
“She’s the mayor of the biggest city in the district, has a pretty big regional profile and name recognition that she’s starting with,” Borick said.
Although Democrats are optimistic about Cognetti’s candidacy, Borick notes that it’s a region that has trended toward the Republican Party over the past several cycles.
Bresnahan also entered October with $1.07 million on hand, while Cognetti’s campaign has just under $445,000.
Eric Stone has also filed to run as a Democrat in the 8th Congressional District, but has not filed a fundraising report.
The race for the 8th District is described by The Cook Political Report as “leans Republican.”
Fitzpatrick raises more than any other incumbent in Q3
U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) continues to add to his steady fundraising advantage in his bid for a 6th term in the purple district in the suburbs north of Philadelphia.
He raised just over $885,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September and spent more than $425,000. With the exception of Stelson, Fitzpatrick raised more than any other congressional candidate in Pennsylvania for the past three months.

Prior to this most recent filing, he raised over $1 million back-to-back quarters in the first half of 2025.
Fitzpatrick’s campaign entered October with $6.93 million on hand, which is the most of any candidate running for Congress in Pennsylvania and is $2 million more than the next closest candidate in any race.
Borick doesn’t view Fitzpatrick’s fundraising advantage as a surprise, given Democrats often target his seat.
“He’s proven very adept at surviving difficult cycles and…  in a district that is certainly very middle of the road,” Borick said. “Once again, I think, positioned himself with the resources that will be necessary to mount a really aggressive campaign to hold his seat.”
Leading the Democratic Party’s fundraising race is Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie. He raised just under $220,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September and spent just over $180,000.
Since announcing his bid for Congress in early April, Harvie has brought in just under $560,000. He entered October with a little more than $230,000 on hand.
Tracy Hunt, an attorney and former Republican, is also seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination for the seat. He raised just under $37,000 since he launched his candidacy in early August to the end of September, which includes a $6,000 loan he gave to his campaign. He entered October with just over $30,000 on hand.
Rob Strickler, who manages an eyewear business, has also filed to run as a Democrat in the race. According to Levittown Now, he will not be seeking donations in the race, but instead is putting his attention to building grassroots support through direct voter engagement.
National ratings outlets describe Fitzpatrick as the favorite in the race, with the Cook Political Report rating it as “likely Republican.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/perry-and-stelson-copy-2.jpg,,,2025-10-24 05:56:40.502684

If you wanted to make a movie about the pain and progress of Kentucky’s Appalachian coalfield in the last 60 years, a key role would be that of Stephen C. Cawood, the Pineville lawyer who died of cancer Oct. 17, three days after he turned 82.
My friend Steve was an activist and a lawyer for people victimized by the coal industry, but also a lawyer for coal companies he respected; briefly a politician, a cloak that didn’t quite fit him; and forever a follower of Mark Twain’s maxim: “Always do right. It will gratify some and astonish the rest.”
Cawood came of age just as big things were happening in Appalachia. National attention focused on the region’s poverty and depredation, local people began organized opposition to strip mining, and groups of young people inside and outside the region had a vision for a better future.
One of those groups helped write the major law for the War on Poverty. Cawood was in that bunch, and the Appalachian Volunteers, who fixed up homes and schools and provided arts and recreation programs for children, then became social activists and adversaries of some local officials and other powerful people, which caused them to lose federal funding and disband.
But Steve Cawood never stopped being a volunteer for Appalachia. When Robert F. Kennedy came to Eastern Kentucky in February 1968, Cawood rode with him, and was planning to join his presidential campaign after law school, but Kennedy was assassinated. “He had a marvelous charisma,” Cawood told a friend. “At every stop, waded right in amongst ’em, very personal, even tearing up with families while alone.”
Armed with a law degree, Cawood represented countless miners seeking federal black-lung benefits, the only survivor of the 1970 mine disaster in Leslie County, and miners striking for a United Mine Workers contract in Harlan County in 1973-74. He persuaded Gov. Wendell Ford to block strip mining near Swan Pond in Knox County, likely with help from his former fellow activist Larry Greathouse, who had become Ford’s general counsel. Steve’s cousin Hap Cawood told The Courier-Journal, “Steve has made a career of helping the poor and opposing strip mining.” This was in 1972; he had been out of law school for four years.
Cawood helped draft the 1977 federal strip-mine law, and was on the White House lawn when Jimmy Carter signed it. Three years later, as a freshman state representative in Frankfort, he chaired a panel that rewrote Kentucky’s law to fit the federal statute. He had come full circle; as a law student in 1966, he had helped write the state law.
But he wasn’t cut out for elective politics, or at least for re-elective politics in a purple district.
In 1979, he had won an open seat by 4.3 percentage points, after raising campaign money from coal operators with the help of his former law professor, state Natural Resources Secretary Eugene Mooney. Cawood voted his conscience and had one of the House’s most liberal voting records in 1980, was sometimes blunt to the point of offense, and drew both Democratic and GOP opposition in 1981. In one of the first Kentucky races where religious groups used eleventh-hour mailers about social issues such as abortion and school prayer, he lost by 2%.
‘Good moral compass’ drove Steve Cawood as he championed his Eastern Kentucky home

“He was, frankly, devastated,” his widow, Jeanette “Sissy” Cawood, told me. “One of the more progressive coal companies [which had a literacy program for miners] hired him to do some lobbying and that was helpful to him because he was back up there in the mix.”
About the time he joined Terry McBrayer’s law-and-lobbying firm in Lexington, Sissy read an article about one of my journalism mentors, KET host Al Smith, in which he frankly discussed his recovery from alcoholism. She saw an opportunity to get Steve sober. She called Smith, who with another member of Alcoholics Anonymous “just saved his life, literally.” And it also “gave him a new front to work on in Appalachia.”
A few years later, Steve called Al to report that the region was suffering from what we later called the opioid epidemic, that good coal jobs were getting scarce, and that schools weren’t improving as much as they should under state education reform. He wanted Al to get one of the state’s major papers to do an update on Appalachia, but they passed.
Our friend Rudy Abramson, an Alabaman just retired from the Los Angeles Times, got a foundation fellowship to write the coal piece, and reported to Smith that newspapers in the region had become less willing to hold the industry and public officials accountable. He and Smith conceived the Institute for Rural Journalism, and Al got the University of Kentucky to adopt it in 2002. I became its first director in 2004, and when I assembled a workshop on coal coverage in 2005, Steve led me to a leading expert on the business, a West Virginia consultant known mainly to insiders.
Steve had been an unusually candid sportswriter in high school (his Pineville Sun column was titled “Let’s Face It”) and he had a great affinity for journalists, especially those with The Courier-Journal. For 30 years, a long line of C-J reporters made such use of his office that we dubbed it the Pineville Bureau. He liked people who sought the truth and told it straight. But he helped anyone who wanted help so they could help others.
Jim Branscome, a journalist and Steve’s friend for more than 50 years, said of him, “Of all the mountain advocates for miners and others in Eastern Kentucky, I don’t know of anyone who has been the source of more information for journalists, congressional staffers, fellow attorneys, organized black-lung groups, and labor leaders.”
And when you add Steve’s legal work for miners, and his authorship of strip-mine laws, you have one of the greatest bodies of work of any Kentuckian to protect people in the mountains from the adverse effects of what was their major industry. And he did much more. Steve Cawood may not have been a very good politician, but he gave us a great example to follow.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado officials entrusted with keeping residents safe from oil and gas production don’t think a recent safety law says what it says. And that’s only one troubling part of the larger story about how companies have avoided compliance with the law.
Enacted in 2022, the law requires oil and gas companies to reveal what toxic chemicals they’re putting into the ground. What they’ve disclosed so far only emphasizes the law’s importance — we now know they’re using fracking chemicals that are banned in the state.
Coloradans have good reason to suspect that what they’ve failed to disclose is also a catalogue of health hazards. State regulators have been slow to ensure compliance, and they’ve interpreted the law in a way that lets companies conceal some of the chemicals they use. Their role is to protect the health of Coloradans, but their performance does more to protect the profits of industry.

Oil and gas operators and the chemical vendors they work with are required to disclose to the state the chemicals they use in underground extraction operations, according to the law. Fracking, the process of “fracturing” geologic formations to release trapped oil and gas, involves the injection underground of high-pressure fluid that typically contains water, sand and other substances. Those other substances can be toxic, and even prohibited, but companies previously could conceal their presence by designating them as “trade secrets.”
The new Colorado law changed that. As Capital & Main reported this week, the measure is among the first of its kind in the country to eliminate the trade secret loophole, and it has started to yield results. Disclosures show that oil and gas companies in Colorado — the fourth largest oil producer and eighth largest natural gas producer in the country — have long been using state-banned chemicals, including the cancer-causing 1,4-Dioxane.
The disclosures were slow to come. The law went into effect more than two years ago, but a watchdog report in May found that most oil and gas companies, notably Chevron and its subsidiaries, had not complied.
“It appears that at least 30 million pounds of chemicals injected into over 600 of the state’s oil and gas wells during the first 21 months covered by the law should have been disclosed, but were not,” said the authors of the report, which was released by Physicians for Social Responsibility, PSR Colorado, Colorado Sierra Club, and FracTracker Alliance.
Release of the report appears to have encouraged greater compliance, and the disclosures are starting to force transparency. For example, they show that quaternary ammonium compounds were used at 59 sites over the last 15 months. Those banned substances pose health risks for children and pregnant women.
But there remains a huge compliance gap. State regulators interpret the disclosure law to apply to fluids used in fracking a well but not in drilling a well. That interpretation defies not only the intent of the law according to supporters but also its plain language.
The law’s own declaration of intent refers to chemicals “used by operators during the drilling and (fracking)” of wells, and it says it applies to “downhole operations.”
State regulators at the Energy and Carbon Management Commission base their interpretation on the law’s definition of downhole operations: “oil and gas production operations that are conducted underground.” 
“Neither the statute nor ECMC Rules define ‘production operations,’ but production generally begins after a well is drilled and completed,” Kristin Kemp, spokesperson for the commission, said in an email.
This strains credibility. If the drilling of a hole isn’t a downhole operation then words have no meaning.
State Rep. Meg Froelich knows something about the law’s intent, since she co-sponsored it. She told Newsline this week that drilling fluids are covered, adding that the Legislature might need to adopt another bill to clarify the scope of the disclosure requirement.
The health of community members is at stake. Drilling fluid, like fracking fluid, can also include toxic chemicals, but it can more easily contaminate ground water, as well as air and soil. 
The history of noncompliance with the disclosure law fits a decades-long pattern in which oil and gas companies avoid safety measures while state regulators appear feckless or complicit. As production expands in the state and increasingly runs up against growing communities, industry hazards threaten a greater swath of the population.
Coloradans need state leaders more than ever to protect them from those hazards.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s Department of Corrections and the state’s corrections ombudsman have settled on a memorandum of understanding — a formality that can help streamline the process of investigating complaints and ensure cooperation when the ombudsman office probes the department.
Corrections ombudsman Andrea Sapone was hired late last year after the state legislature created her position. She has hired additional staff to her office since then and coordinated with VADOC on the MOU. Sapone is tasked with investigating complaints regarding Virginia’s correctional facilities and already has a high-profile investigation on the horizon into Red Onion State Prison.
Virginia’s new corrections ombudsman to prioritize Red Onion prison probe

From June to August, Office of the Inspector General data shows 568 complaints have been filed, with 77 stemming from Wallens Ridge State Prison and 113 stemming from Red Onion. 
Inmates, along with their friends and family and other advocates, have also reached out to The Mercury over the past year to relay concerns of mistreatment and poor living conditions at both facilities, particularly Red Onion. 
Allegations in the complaints include excessive use of force, delayed medical care and prolonged isolation. 
Though Virginia technically does not have solitary confinement, it has “restorative housing,” wherein inmates are isolated but are supposed to be permitted a few hours of time outside per day. Some inmates have said that is not happening and that frequent lockdowns also make many inmates feel isolated because they lose access to programming and must remain in their cells. 
Accusations of racism and religious discrimination have also surfaced — reaching a tipping point last year when a handful of Red Onion inmates burned themselves. Some inmates and advocates say the burns were acts of protest or desperate attempts to seek transfer to a different facility. At a December meeting with state lawmakers, VADOC director Chad Dotson attributed the incidents to mental health issues or attempts to be housed in facilities closer to their families.
Some of the frequent lockdowns around the state might be attributable to prisons having insufficient staffing, a  2024 report to lawmakers suggested. The report described staffing levels has “dangerously low” leading to “very few” education programs operating and some facilities being unable to provide the time outside of cells that inmates are legally entitled to.
The new MOU outlines assurance that OSIG can subpoena the department for records and data to investigate problems. On the flip side, department staff are able to have their legal counsel with them during any testimony during investigations and VADOC is permitted to review OSIG’s findings prior to publication, to ensure information that   “could jeopardize the safety or security of the facility, staff or inmates” isn’t disclosed.
The department’s data on inmate and staff deaths, suicides, suicide attempts in custody, physical and sexual assaults in custody, amount of inmates in “restorative housing,” amount of facility lockdowns lasting longer than 24 hours, and the number of in-person visits to inmates that have been made and denied will all be subject to sharing with OSIG. Officials will also need to include the amount of complaints or grievances submitted to VADOC along with documentation of their resolution and how long it took to resolve them. 
OSIG will be able to view body camera or facility camera footage at mutually agreed-upon dates and times, the MOU stated.
Additionally, OSIG can request data on staff vacancies per facility, inmate to staff ratios per facility, as well as staff tenure, turnover and compensation.
It also allows the ombudsman team to follow up on VADOC’s internal affairs investigations and review their findings with a set of external eyes — although an OSIG spokesperson said granting that request “would depend on the nature of the internal investigation and if it fell within the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction.”
The Mercury first learned an MOU was in the works when Sapone held a community meeting this summer where she shared how her office was bulking up its staff and preparing to more formally launch into the work it was created to do. 
In the meantime a “backlog” of complaints have piled up that the office’s staff is processing. 
As Sapone noted during the meeting, some complaints are duplicates that stem from mass emailing campaigns. Since OSIG staff are required by law to process and enter information for each complaint they receive, the spokesperson said in a recent email staff must spend more time at desks and less timeout investigating complaints. 
“We ask for the public’s continued patience, and to refrain from submitting duplicates of complaints as this exacerbates the backlog,” they said.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)SCOTTSVILLE, Va.—In rural Fluvanna County about an hour west of the state capital, a proposed natural gas power plant offers a window into a multi-state effort to speed more electricity sources onto the grid.
All but a handful of the projects in the initiative by PJM Interconnection, which runs the regional grid, would belch carbon pollution. Tenaska Energy’s proposal is among those dubbed by PJM as “shovel-ready, high-reliability” generation projects that would get a faster path through the clogged queue to connect to a grid increasingly stressed by power-hungry data centers.
But power plants need local approval, too. Tenaska’s proposal, which has some support, also faces concerns from residents about health effects, noise and transparency.
Last week the Fluvanna County Planning Commission deferred until November any decision on whether the 1.5-gigawatt plant is in “substantial accord” with the county’s comprehensive plan, a crucial step needed along with a special-use permit that will be voted on in January.



“I think we’d like to rely on science and independent judgment before we’re asked to take what is a very critical step for this community and its long-term future,” said commission member Kathleen Kilpatrick.
The company wants to build the project next to a gas plant it already operates in the county, the Tenaska Virginia Generating Station. Amber Kidd, a Fluvanna resident, told Inside Climate News that she supports the Nebraska-based developer’s proposal, given that her family has worked at the existing plant without any safety issues.
“We are a fossil-fuel family,” said Kidd. “I’m very proud of where we work and want to see this come. Rural areas that continue to refuse growth, they die off. … I support the jobs.”
In a county of about 30,000 people that President Donald Trump won by about six points, his staunch support for fossil fuels is far from universally shared by its residents. Lauren Banning, at the planning commission meeting last week, said she is concerned about toxic emissions more than a “negligible tax break, a few jobs, not even 50.”
“My kids love playing outside all day long, but if I’m scared of the air not being breathable, how is this helping our county and our community?” Banning said.
 The proposal 

The proposed $2.2 billion plant, called the Expedition Generating Station, is expected to come online in 2031 after obtaining local, state and federal permits. It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.
Timberly Ross, a spokesperson for the company, told Inside Climate News that the planning commission vote deferral “pushes us back a few months, but we remain committed to bringing this much-needed development to Fluvanna County.”
Tenaska said the new plant could power up to 1.5 million homes. It’s part of PJM’s Reliability Resource Initiative, called RRI for short. PJM, which oversees a competitive market for wholesale electricity in all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, is inserting RRI projects into its backlogged queue of interconnection requests.

Most of the non-RRI projects waiting to connect to the grid are renewables.
PJM created the initiative to ensure ample electric generating capacity and avoid shortages resulting from data centers’ surging demands. But clean energy supporters have decried that projects that are mostly fueled by natural gas will leapfrog renewables that have long waited their turn to start cranking out electricity.
Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, is planning for several gas plants alongside a number of renewable energy projects of its own to meet demand. Tenaska is an independent power producer that would sell electricity from Expedition either directly into the regional grid or to Dominion through a power purchase agreement.
Since the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s goal to decarbonize the electric grid by 2050 applies to only Dominion and utility Appalachian Power, Tenaska is not bound by requirements to prove the need for the plant or retire it within the next 25 years.
“This location is attractive due to access to existing transmission corridors, water supply and natural gas pipelines,” the company said in a presentation before the planning commission.
Tenaska also builds renewables projects. But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.
“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson. But in Fluvanna, given local hostility to renewables, Ross said the gas plant “is the appropriate technology for this location.”
 Questions about air pollution, noise 

Tenaska hasn’t yet disclosed expected pollution levels from the new plant. Nor has it shared in planning meetings what its current plant’s emissions have been.
Instead, at the planning commission meeting, Tenaska representatives noted what the company had anticipated its existing plant’s emissions of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and two types of fine particle pollution would be, estimated years before the project was built. They said it showed rates “less than 15 percent of the applicable standard.”
All of those pollutants can cause serious health problems, particularly involving the lungs.
Josephus Allmond, a resident of Fluvanna and an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, shared information on cancer rates at a meeting in October held by Chris Fairchild, the Board of Supervisors’ chairman. Allmond cited a 2012 report by the regional health district showing that lung cancer incidents in Fluvanna County between 2004 to 2008, the period just after Tenaska built its first plant, increased more than 30 percent compared with 1999 to 2003.
“My question for the folks at Tenaska: That was for a plant slightly under 1,000 megawatts—can we expect an even bigger increase in incidents of lung cancer if this plant is approved?” said Allmond.
Residents asked the company at that meeting why it wasn’t sharing actual pollution figures from its operating plants around the country. Tenaska officials said they would share more emissions data later, through the state’s pollution permitting process.

The company on its website also states that “claims regarding the plant and local cancer cases are ridiculous and defamatory.” Federal air standards protect against health impacts, including cancer, the company contends, and it says the new plant will be categorized as a “minor source of hazardous air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.
Another worry raised by residents at that meeting was noise. Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.
“I have the same concerns,” Fairchild told the residents. “But we don’t deal with a $2 billion item every day. There are a lot of concerns that haven’t been addressed.”
The company’s spokesperson told Inside Climate News that the current plant is a net positive for the area.
“Tenaska has operated in Fluvanna County for more than 20 years, consistently meeting stringent air quality standards, operating under the county-mandated sound levels and providing roughly $35 million in tax revenue to the county,” Ross said. “Our application … not only provided those facts but also included robust supplemental materials, including an independent sound study, economic impact study, traffic plan and visual renderings.”
Laurie Partner, a local real estate agent whose husband works at the plant, said to the planning commission that the smoke coming from the stacks was “steam,” and cancer can come from other sources like smoking and microwaving plastics.
“It was almost sickening to me to hear all the misinformation that was stated there,” Partner said in an interview with Inside Climate News.
Sharon Harris, a Fluvanna resident, said she sees a lot of misinformation floating around the county about a main alternative to new gas plants: solar. As a founding member of the Fluvanna Horizons Alliance, which opposes Tenaska’s project, she wants to raise awareness of who needs the power—data centers, not local residents—and a better understanding of how solar works.
Local resentment toward clean energy has grown through hours-long county meetings discussing potential harms to farmland from solar, stormwater runoff concerns and a presentation from the Citizen Defenders of Fluvanna County on what to do with solar panels after they’ve reached the end of their life. Some residents still see it as an expensive form of energy, even though financial advisory firm Lazard’s widely cited research on electricity costs shows solar is now the cheapest option.
“There’s definitely a lack of knowledge and information in our community,” said Harris.

Bagshaw, a metal parts manufacturer based in Hudson, found out that its health insurance policies with Anthem would increase approximately 38% in 2026. Anthem specifically cited the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax credits at the center of the current federal government shutdown.
The notice from the company’s insurance broker, which the company provided to the Bulletin, said Anthem is raising rates due to the “elimination of individual subsidies, and (a) resulting decline in individual market membership” as well as “higher-than-expected medical and pharmacy utilization.”
A letter notifies the WH Bagshaw Company that its health plan premiums would increase 38%. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The ACA Enhanced Premium Tax Credits — which were established in 2021 as an upgrade to tax credits that were already available — subsidize health care for Americans who buy their coverage through the ACA Marketplace on HealthCare.gov. Nearly 50,000 people in New Hampshire used the credits in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They’re set to expire in December, and when they do, premiums are expected to skyrocket.
New Futures, a New Hampshire-based health policy advocacy organization, estimates that if and when the subsidies expire, a single person in their mid-40s in New Hampshire who earns $31,300 annually could see their total annual premiums increase $1,344. The effects vary greatly based on income and demographic factors. For a New Hampshire couple in their 60s earning $90,000 annually, premiums could increase $14,712, per the same analysis.
Senate Democrats, seeking to avoid that fate, elevated the issue during budget negotiations. They refused to vote for any spending plan that didn’t extend the tax credits. Republicans, who hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate, never acceded, and without a federal spending plan in place on Oct. 1, the federal government shut down.
Some experts have warned the expiration could impact more than just those using the subsidies. As their premiums skyrocket, many healthy people who use the credits will likely forgo coverage. That in turn affects insurance companies’ bottom lines, and so rates will go up for customers like W.H. Bagshaw and other employers.
W.H. Bagshaw is owned and operated by Aaron and Adria Bagshaw. The company, which was founded by Aaron’s great-great-grandfather, employs 32 full-time employees and is attempting to hire more. The manufacturing company creates small, precise metal parts used in a variety of industries, including aerospace and medical technology. The company recently relocated from Nashua into an upgraded facility in Hudson.
Adria Bagshaw said the company spends more on their employees’ health care than on raw materials. She said that’s “partly by business design.”
“We’ve made a values-based decision here to pay 100% of the premium for our employees, so our employees have free health insurance,” she said. “It’s very generous, but it’s really, really important to us that we cover them. The easy answer is, everyone’s telling us, ‘Just push the cost on to your employees.’ And I’m like, ‘That doesn’t work.’ … If you put 20% of the cost on the employee that’s taking money out of their pocket, it’s like reducing their pay.”
She said they’re meeting with their broker next week and hope to find a creative solution.

U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who visited W.H. Bagshaw Thursday, said he’s heard from a lot of businesses and constituents that their premiums are rising. Pappas, whose family owns the Puritan restaurant in Manchester, evoked his own health insurance experiences as an employer.
“It was customary that you would sort of see a 10, 12, 15% increase on an annual basis,” Pappas said. “And, you know, you just sort of got used to that, and would have to factor that into your planning, but we never saw anything like 40% — that’s crazy.”
He argued Republicans’ decision not to renew the tax credits have “real-world consequences.”
“By not renewing the tax credits for ACA plans, it’s having a ripple effect across markets,” he said. “And so whether you have an individual policy or are on a group plan, insurance costs are going to go up. You’re going to have people dropping their insurance. That’s going to impact all of us.”
Pappas said he supports his Senate colleagues’ decision not to vote for a spending plan to open the government without the tax credits. Asked how he squares his desire to extend the tax credits with the pain of federal employees not receiving a paycheck or families who likely won’t receive food assistance and other federal benefits, Pappas said he would support congressional fixes to those things.
“I don’t think we have to choose,” he said. “There are bills we can pass to pay the military, to pay federal workers, to make sure that furloughed workers and contractors are made whole, to make sure that important programs like fuel assistance and food stamps continue to roll forward.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bagshaw1-1024x766.jpg,,,2025-10-24 05:17:43.997458

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Californians have purchased home insurance from a state-managed “last resort” insurance pool that has grown rapidly as private insurance companies have fled the market.
Now, in the wake of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan is seeking approval from the state for an average 36% rate hike, which would further squeeze homeowners who have no other options for coverage.
Insurance experts say it’s a national warning sign, as the effects of climate change cause private insurance companies to pull back on coverage in disaster-prone areas, leaving states and their residents to assume more of the risk. Fewer homeowners will be able to purchase private insurance in the future, and even those who do may face higher premiums as companies charge more to pay for the FAIR Plan losses.
In some states, these state-managed insurance plans have grown from a handful of policies, as originally intended, to hundreds of thousands of homeowners. The plans charge high premiums and provide limited coverage.
California fires show states’ ‘last resort’ insurance plans could be overwhelmed

“It was supposed to be a stopgap measure. People are supposed to be on a FAIR Plan policy for a short amount of time, but with climate change and these extreme weather events, that’s not going to happen,” said Alfonso Pating, global financial regulation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit.
At present, 35 states and the District of Columbia offer FAIR Plans or Citizens Plans to homeowners who can’t find coverage on the private market. The plans are managed by state governments, with the financial backing of the private insurers doing business in that state.
The plans maintain enough reserves to cover payouts for an average year. But when the plans take heavy losses, they impose an assessment on a pool of the insurance companies doing business in the state, based on their market share.
These state-managed plans were initially created to cover a small number of properties as a temporary, last-resort option. But now, as wildfires and hurricanes have pushed insurance companies to retreat from certain areas, FAIR Plans cover nearly 3 million properties nationwide, with an exposure exceeding $1 trillion, according to data issued last year by the Insurance Information Institute.
“If it’s going to keep on growing, it becomes impossible to manage the risk,” Douglas Heller, director of insurance with the Consumer Federation of America, a research and advocacy nonprofit, said in an interview earlier this year. “It’s OK if the high risk is just a small pool, but if the private sector is unwilling to take any of the high-risk [policies], that model doesn’t work anymore.”
States beg insurers not to drop climate-threatened homes

In California, the FAIR Plan reached its breaking point following the January wildfires that devastated Los Angeles. In the months before the fires, insurance companies had dropped coverage in many neighborhoods of the city, causing the state-backed insurer to take on policies covering billions of dollars.
The FAIR Plan was hit with $4 billion in losses when the fires wiped out many of the properties that had recently turned to the plan for coverage. After the plan’s reserves were exhausted, state regulators imposed a $1 billion assessment on insurance companies in the state. Some of those companies received permission to impose a surcharge on all their customers, residents not covered by the FAIR Plan, totaling more than $150 million so far, according to the Los Angeles Times.
This mechanism, which allows an assessment on all insurance policyholders in a state to make a state-managed plan solvent again, is known in Florida as the “hurricane tax.”
In the wake of the California wildfires, the FAIR Plan is seeking an average 36% rate hike on homeowners in the plan, which the insurance pool says is necessary to keep up with the growing risks. That proposal will be reviewed by state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara.
FAIR Plans typically provide only bare-bones coverage, and California’s plan is facing lawsuits over its smoke damage policy. Now, the homeowners who rely on that plan could be facing much higher premiums for their coverage.
Some observers say the dire situation in California shows the unsustainable path many states are on as more and more residents lose coverage on the private market. California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts and North Carolina all have more than 100,000 properties insured by their state plans, according to the Insurance Information Institute’s data.
A report authored by Pating, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, described a potential “cycle of doom” in which FAIR Plans assume more and more risk, taking heavy losses as climate change-driven weather events batter their states. Under this scenario, when the plans are forced to charge assessments on private insurers to replenish their reserves, more insurance companies retreat from doing business in the state, pushing even more residents on to the FAIR Plan.











The private market isn't going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times.


– Alfonso Pating, global financial regulation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council



“You’ll see continued growth of these policies,” Pating said. “The private market isn’t going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times. Every time an event happens, it’s just going to get worse and worse.”
Pating called on states to use their FAIR Plans to incentivize hazard mitigation work — lowering premiums for property owners and communities who take steps to protect themselves from storms and wildfires. He said state regulators should also require more transparency from insurers about where they’re dropping policies and raising premiums, which would help state officials better understand the risks.
Dave Jones, a former California insurance commissioner, has called for a federal reinsurance program for state FAIR Plans — using taxpayer-funded reserves to backstop the plans.
“We’re going to have to look at shoring up FAIR Plans,” Jones said in an interview earlier this year. “The future is not a good one with regard to insurance availability and pricing because we’re not dealing with the root cause of climate change.”
Jones now serves as director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment.

Only U.S. citizens, green card holders who have gone through a five-year waiting period, and some Haitian and Cuban nationals with special status will be eligible for SNAP. This means refugees, people who have been granted asylum and human trafficking survivors will all lose their benefits, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service gave states 120 days to implement these changes, meaning Nov. 1 is the deadline.

More than 183,000 Franklin County residents receive SNAP benefits and most of them are children and seniors, said Joy Bivens, deputy Franklin County administrator of health and human services. The Franklin County Commissioners expect more than 4,100 residents — including 1,700 children — will be impacted by the SNAP changes. 
Immigrants and refugees made up about 56% of Franklin County’s population growth between 2020 and 2023, said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley. 
“The proposed changes to SNAP benefits will put many of these families in jeopardy,” she said. “They are people who have endured trauma, made tremendous sacrifices and risked their lives to give their families security and freedom. These individuals often arrive with no local family connections and no established community. Without this support, they are often left to navigate life in an unfamiliar country with very limited resources, they face food insecurity, housing instability and limited access to health care.”
Approximately 1.39 million Ohioans receive an average of $190 of SNAP benefits each month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP.
“When families can’t rely on SNAP, they are forced to spend their limited income on food, and often at the expense of medical care, rent or utilities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” said Franklin County Commissioner John O’Grady. “Losing SNAP benefits isn’t just about hunger, it’s about health, stability and opportunity. Children may face developmental display delays. Families may confront chronic health issues.”
SNAP helps stabilize families when they are new to the U.S., said Jewish Family Services CEO Karen Mozenter. 
“They have done everything right, and they are eager to contribute as Americans,” she said. “Cutting off the support that helps them feed their families and care for them while they find their footing in a new country, that hurts them and that hurts all of us.”
The Mid-Ohio Food Collective is serving 58% more families now than at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, said President and CEO Matt Habash. 
“Unfortunately, we don’t expect those numbers to go down,” he said. “The cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of health care, and more are all putting pressure on household budgets, and now we’re dealing with cuts to SNAP — America’s first line of defense against hunger.”

A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.
But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.


House Bill 15, which took effect Aug. 14, lets the state’s Department of Development designate such properties as ​“priority investment areas” at the request of a local government.


The law aims to boost energy production to meet growing demand from data centers and increasing electrification, while applying competitive pressure to rein in power prices.


Targeting former coal mines and brownfields as priority investment areas furthers that goal while encouraging the productive use of land after mining, manufacturing, or other industrial activity ends. Buyers are often wary of acquiring these properties due to the risk of lingering pollution.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe new law could also help developers sidestep the bitter land-use battles that have bogged down other clean-energy projects in Ohio, particularly those looking to use farmland.


Priority areas might ​“otherwise not see these investments, which can breathe new life into communities, improve energy reliability, provide tax revenue, and lower electricity costs,” said Diane Cherry, deputy director of MAREC Action, a clean-energy industry group.


Ohio has more than 567,000 acres of mine lands and about 50,000 acres of brownfields that are potentially suitable for renewable-energy development, according to a 2024 report from The Nature Conservancy. Federal funding to clean up abandoned mine lands has continued so far under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, so yet more sites may become available. Overall, remediating documented hazards at Ohio’s abandoned mine lands is estimated to cost nearly $586 million, said spokesperson Karina Cheung at the state Department of Natural Resources.


But two Ohio agencies still need to finalize rules before companies can start building energy projects in these underutilized spaces and benefiting from the new law.


The Department of Development has not yet proposed standards for approving requests to designate priority investment areas, said spokesperson Mason Waldvogel. However, in late August, the Ohio Power Siting Board proposed rules to implement HB 15, and the public comment period just closed.


Under the law, approved priority investment areas will get a five-year tax exemption for equipment used to transport electricity or natural gas. The sites will also be eligible for grants of up to $10 million for cleanup and construction preparation.


HB 15 also calls for accelerated regulatory permit review of proposed energy projects in priority investment areas. The Power Siting Board will have 45 days to determine if a permit application is complete, plus another 45 days to make a decision on it.


Those timelines are shorter than the approximately five months HB 15 allows for standard projects. And it’s substantially faster than recent projects where it took the board more than a year to grant or deny applications after they were filed.


 The debate over HB 15 rules

Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.

A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both in all or a significant part of their jurisdiction. This authority was granted to them by a 2021 law, Senate Bill 52.


However, the language and legislative history of HB 15 make clear that it ​“was meant to be technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.


HB 15 even states that its terms for permitting energy projects in priority investment areas apply ​“notwithstanding” some other parts of Ohio law.


“That clause is meant to bypass some of the typical Ohio Power Siting Board procedures — including the procedures for siting in restricted areas” under SB 52, wrote Bill Stanley, Ohio director for The Nature Conservancy, in comments filed with the board.


But the exemption provided by the ​“notwithstanding” clause is narrow, Mellino added, because local government authorities must ask for a priority investment area designation. That means, for example, that in a county with a solar and wind ban in place, officials would need to choose to request that a former coal mine or brownfield become a priority investment area.


The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.


Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.


For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in comments that, in order to align with HB 15, the board’s rules should require energy developers to notify the public of an application when it is filed, rather than after it is deemed complete.


Separate comments from the American Clean Power Association, MAREC Action, and the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio ask for tweaks to provisions regarding notices on public hearings and for clarifications on application fees. The board should also promptly issue certificates for projects that are automatically approved, say comments by Robert Brundrett, president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.


The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said. Meanwhile, the department has received its first request to designate a priority investment area. The ask comes from Jefferson County’s board of commissioners, which did not specify the type of energy that may be built in the area.


That request deals with land where FirstEnergy’s former Sammis coal plant is undergoing demolition, as well as the Hollow Rock Landfill, which received waste from the site. HB 15 gives the department 90 days to act on designation requests.


The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months. Ultimately, said Cherry of MAREC Action, the law ​“clears the path for developers to bring energy projects online quickly and affordably, something Ohio’s consumers and businesses desperately need.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau/ WEWS)The Ohio House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill reforming both the marijuana and hemp industries.
When voters chose to legalize recreational cannabis in 2023, they knew what they wanted — that’s what marijuana industry spokesperson Adrienne Robbins said.
“We want to see that stay put,” Robbins, with Ohio Cannabis Coalition, said.
That is why she is supporting the marijuana policy inside amended Senate Bill 56 — the House’s latest effort to pass changes to THC policy.
“You have both parties, all factions of this issue coming together to get this bill done,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart (R-Ashville) said. “And I think it’s a big success.”
Since the start of the year, Stewart and other marijuana supporters have been trying to compromise with the Senate on separate cannabis bills. The Senate wanted to make dozens of restrictions, but the House said that wasn’t what the Ohioans chose.
Stewart, working with House reps. Jamie Callender (R-Concord) and Tex Fischer (R-Boardman) tried to negotiate with the Senate. Callender is known as the marijuana expert, while Fischer calls himself a “hemp-resentative.”
Finally, a deal was crafted between the two chambers this summer, but the Senate pulled out at the last minute.
“Do you think that this is closer to the will of the voters?” I asked Stewart.
“Oh, absolutely,” he responded.
The House’s bill keeps home growing the same, restricts marketing that would appeal to kids and finally gives cities with dispensaries part of the tax revenue from sales.
“That is something these communities have been waiting for,” Robbins said. “It is something they were promised.”
The City of Cleveland said it appreciated this step by the House.
“We remain hopeful that this will advance through the Legislature and that we receive these funds soon, which will go towards pressing needs in our community — including public safety,” city spokesperson Tyler Sinclair said.
But hemp seller Doug Strahm said this legislation isn’t fair.
“They’re looking at trying to financially knock people out of the business, and that’s not what this country’s all about,” Strahm said.
The legislation generally bans intoxicating hemp products, low-level THC that’s been commonly available at gas stations and smoke shops. It’s also frequently packaged to look like candy and doesn’t have age restrictions. But under the bill, there are some exceptions for low-level products, and stores can still sell THC-infused drinks to people 21 and older.
The bill also sets up a legal framework to regulate hemp products similar to marijuana. But Strahm complained it comes at a high cost — $5,000 more than a license for cannabis dispenseries.
“To try to come into the hemp business at $75,000 for a new license, even though it’s over a two year period, that makes it really difficult,” he said.
Stewart argued that this is about safety — making sure children don’t get THC and that adults know what’s in the products they are buying.
“It kind of balances — keep it away from kids, but also doesn’t put people out of business arbitrarily,” Stewart said.
Now the bill goes back to the Senate for negotiations — and Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) wasn’t thrilled with the bill.
“There are going to be some things that are probably some members of our caucus will have issues with,” McColley said.
I asked him what the concerns are so far.
“It’s a brand new regulatory scheme for hemp, relative to what we had been talking about… Some of the other items regarding how they’re treating products and everything, we have some concerns about that,” McColley said.
After the story aired, Robbins added that while she supports the marijuana provisions in the bill, she doesn’t support the hemp portion. When asked why, she said she still needs to look through the bill further to see what changes she wants to see regarding the hemp regulation, but has some concerns already — similar to McColley.
The marijuana industry and the hemp industry are rivals, and several dispensaries have previously told us that they don’t think hemp should be sold without having a full marijuana license.
Hemp industry coalition leader Dakota Sawyer said he is trying to talk to convince the Senate not to concur.
When asked about how to tackle the conference committee, the House said they knew their priorities and would represent the people of Ohio — while also making sure that all THC products are safe and regulated.

(Eric Thomas illustration / Kansas Reflector)As a middle-aged instructor at the front of a college lecture hall, I feel like a pivot point — a human crossroads around which academic writing has shifted, yet again. 
That’s a big thesis. 
Let me explain. 
In college courses, we educators have a few standard assignment types. There’s the multiple-choice exam, whether on mimeographed paper, Scantron answer sheets or an online exam. 
There’s the group project, the titanic, looming assignment that everyone loves to hate.
And then there is the writing assignment. Maybe it’s a literary interpretation of a Shakespeare sonnet. Or a research paper about the formation of sedimentary rocks. Or an essay comparing communism with socialism. 
Happily, I confess my love for slogging away at academic writing. (Maybe that’s why I sit before you at 11:38 p.m. writing this column as my side gig.) 
During my senior year of high school, the writing bug bit me hard. My teacher invited us to choose a topic — any topic — and spend weeks writing a research paper. Requirement: it had to be longer than 10 pages. (God bless you, Mr. Parr, and your grading stamina.) 
I found myself, two months later, on the floor of my Midwestern basement at 2 a.m. with index cards spread around me, each scrap of paper a detail about the Watts Riots of 1965. 
Facts pulled from microfilm at the local library. Anecdotes from Life Magazine. Quotes from historians. I shuffled and sorted and stacked the cards endlessly until they added up to an 18-page research paper. 
By the end, I was dazzled by what I had learned (if not my grade from the imposing Mr. Parr). That kind of research and writing defined the next four years of college for me as well: Dive in and figure out something novel to say about, well, whatever was assigned.
The pursuit that I found in many of those assignments fuels my nostalgia today. I fear we are watching the experience of academic writing being shrugged off by artificial intelligence. 
Before we get to that, let’s rewind.
There are three generations of academic writers alive today, in my thinking. I’m not talking about Boomers and Gen Xers and Millennials. These cohorts are based on what writing was like for them in high school and college.  
 
The Linear Marvels
Each generation wonders how the previous one did it. That’s how I feel about the Linear Marvels. 
For college students even a few years older than me, the tools were elegantly simple: their notes, a typewriter and paper.
How did they marshal their facts so orderly and calmly? How did they start their writing at the beginning, continue toward the middle and finish with an ending? No cursor-ing up and down through shambling sentences. No repairing broken logic. No parachuting a paragraph into a new location. 
It’s beyond me how the Linear Marvels did it. I could more easily pick a lock with a water balloon.   
 
The Cutters-and-Pasters 
By the time I did any kind of ambitious writing, word processors queued up in columns in high school and college classrooms. These machines allowed us to move backward and forward in what we hoped to write, fixing our errors and inserting examples that we omitted. 
Soon, software and desktop computers allowed us to see an entire essay or research paper on the screen. We scrolled through paragraphs and added footnotes with ease. We meddled with the point size and margins to push the essay to three pages. 
Eventually we used the internet — cutting and pasting the perfect quote from an academic journal or literary criticism. While it’s tempting to consider the advent of the internet as a whole new phase in academic writing, we were still doing essentially the same intellectual activity of cobbling together an argument as we had with other sources. 
However, it was still fundamentally different from the Linear Marvels — and certainly a different way from my students this semester. 
 
The Un-Assessables 
So we arrive at the smash-up of artificial intelligence and academic writing.
If you are a skeptic of artificial intelligence, park your doubt for a moment. Consider the magnitude of change: Within a few years, academic writing in undergraduate classrooms has been scrambled by AI. 
My classroom assignments from three years ago are imminently hackable because I gave students time away from class (and away from my supervision) to write. If a college instructor hopes for the student to be the source of the words and ideas on the page in 2025, you can seldom — if ever — let them do the writing outside of class. 
It’s simply too easy to ask ChatGPT: “Please generate a 1,000-word essay about Blah-Blah-Blah. Be sure that it has some language errors and diction choices that would be appropriate for an undergraduate student at a mid-sized state university.” 
It’s almost folksy to remember a few years ago when students would pay another student — or a web-based service — to provide a completed essay for them. I don’t even need to type a username or password into ChatGPT. It’s happy to give me A-level undergrad work for free. 
Providing one of my course’s essay questions to artificial intelligence a few years ago yielded an essay with the sophistication of mashed carrots. Back then, when I tested the prompts on different AI models, factual errors infested the sentences. 
“Use AI,” I said to my class, “if you enjoy reading essays that would earn a C- on the exam.” 
Students giddily pointed out the AI hallucinations. On the eve of taking the exam, they knew more than AI. 
Today, not so much. The AI answers are direct, correct and subtly different each time you ask. There are some funky formatting quirks. For instance, every answer has more headings than a BuzzFeed listicle. Otherwise, the AI content (at least in my subject area) has rapidly improved.
Many of today’s instructors threaten to suss out the AI papers submitted by their students. The reality? These instructors are likely to catch honest writers in their dragnet and alienate them with flimsy accusations of academic dishonesty. Enraged students tell me about honest writing that got flagged by dubious instructors. 
If not the out-of-class writing, then what? 
Here’s another reliable method, but one soon to be obsolete, that we have used in academia. Perhaps you remember it. The instructor provides students with five different essay prompts but only one of them will appear on the exam. 
The educational allure is obvious. Students must research and outline — if not write — five different essays to be prepared for the mystical chosen one on exam day. (“I hope it’s No. 5!”) 
AI has broken this option as well. The researching, outline and writing has been replaced by a much more nefarious cut-and-paste. Cut the question. Paste it into AI. 
Just memorize the content of five essays. Heave the book out the window. Who needs extraneous details when I can mainline the slender lineup of facts that slays the question? 
Where does that leave us? The research paper: gutted. The critical essay: old-fashioned. The randomly chosen in-class essay: obsolete. 
No wonder universities are sponsoring AI everything — but especially AI teaching summits to help us figure out what is next for writing within higher education. Assessing students in the age of AI is an increasingly elaborate cat-and-mouse game with instructors scurrying to keep up.  
However, it’s vital that we do, because when powered by AI, undergraduate writing will never be the same.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) At Miami University, my colleagues and I are alarmed that the federal government has invited all universities to sign its so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” 
This invitation came quickly upon the heels of MIT’s rejection of the compact and the threat that the other eight universities originally selected for the compact would also refuse to sign. This compact is no less than a federal loyalty oath: President Donald Trump has said that failing to sign would jeopardize federal funding. Compliance would be subject to ongoing review by the U.S. Department of Justice, and insufficient compliance would result in a loss of access to student loans, grant programs, federal contracts, funding for research, approval of visas and tax exemption. 
When an invitation is accompanied by consequences for not accepting it, it is in fact a threat. University decisions are made according to shared governance procedures that are essential to our independence, academic freedom and to democracy as a whole.
Ohio’s public colleges and universities are already reeling from the erosion of academic independence that has accompanied the implementation of Ohio’s Senate Bill 1. In the few short months since that law has been in effect, we’ve already seen public colleges and universities eliminate degree programs, close student centers that serve marginalized student populations, restrict the use of land acknowledgements, and roll back the rights of academic workers.
Miami University must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding what is left of our self-determination. Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university. That’s why our union, the Faculty Alliance of Miami (FAM, AAUP-AFT, Local 375), is urging our university’s administration to refuse to sign this compact, and faculty in other public universities in Ohio are calling on their universities to do the same.
This attempt at coercion is just one of the many examples of intensifying political interference in higher education. Going far beyond Senate Bill 1’s limitations on diversity efforts, the compact makes other demands about admission that undermine the Civil Rights Act of 1964, like requiring the use of standardized tests and limiting the admission of international students. These decisions should be left to our university in consultation with faculty. 
It requires our university to make certain ideological commitments regarding sex and gender that are incompatible with both science and Miami’s values, and orders that bathrooms, locker rooms and sports be segregated accordingly. It claims to ensure a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus, but requires our university to screen out foreign students with “noxious values” or “hostility to the United States, its allies, or its values.” It requires “serious” disciplinary action and the use of force “if necessary” to prevent disruption by demonstrators, and requires open-ended information sharing with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State. 
Given recent government actions to suppress the expression of ideas with which it disagrees, such as the unconstitutional policy of arresting, detaining, and deporting noncitizen students and faculty members for their pro-Palestinian advocacy, this can only be interpreted as a thinly-veiled attempt to restrict academic freedom to those who express government-approved views, defeating the very purpose of academic freedom and of higher education as a whole.

While the loss of federal funding would threaten Miami’s ability to perform its vital education and research work, agreeing to this compact would not forestall that outcome. A concession to threats will simply embolden the Trump administration to come back for more. 
Funding cuts are not insurmountable. For example, the university could temporarily raise the rate of spending on its generous endowment, while collaborating with other institutions to sue for the restoration of unconstitutionally withheld funds. Sacrificing our values, on the other hand, would irreparably damage our university. Miami’s motto, love and honor, obligates us to defend liberal education as a public good and care about all of our students, staff, and faculty. Now is the time to put that principle into practice.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) At Miami University, my colleagues and I are alarmed that the federal government has invited all universities to sign its so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” 
This invitation came quickly upon the heels of MIT’s rejection of the compact and the threat that the other eight universities originally selected for the compact would also refuse to sign. This compact is no less than a federal loyalty oath: President Donald Trump has said that failing to sign would jeopardize federal funding. Compliance would be subject to ongoing review by the U.S. Department of Justice, and insufficient compliance would result in a loss of access to student loans, grant programs, federal contracts, funding for research, approval of visas and tax exemption. 
When an invitation is accompanied by consequences for not accepting it, it is in fact a threat. University decisions are made according to shared governance procedures that are essential to our independence, academic freedom and to democracy as a whole.
Ohio’s public colleges and universities are already reeling from the erosion of academic independence that has accompanied the implementation of Ohio’s Senate Bill 1. In the few short months since that law has been in effect, we’ve already seen public colleges and universities eliminate degree programs, close student centers that serve marginalized student populations, restrict the use of land acknowledgements, and roll back the rights of academic workers.
Miami University must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding what is left of our self-determination. Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university. That’s why our union, the Faculty Alliance of Miami (FAM, AAUP-AFT, Local 375), is urging our university’s administration to refuse to sign this compact, and faculty in other public universities in Ohio are calling on their universities to do the same.
This attempt at coercion is just one of the many examples of intensifying political interference in higher education. Going far beyond Senate Bill 1’s limitations on diversity efforts, the compact makes other demands about admission that undermine the Civil Rights Act of 1964, like requiring the use of standardized tests and limiting the admission of international students. These decisions should be left to our university in consultation with faculty. 
It requires our university to make certain ideological commitments regarding sex and gender that are incompatible with both science and Miami’s values, and orders that bathrooms, locker rooms and sports be segregated accordingly. It claims to ensure a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus, but requires our university to screen out foreign students with “noxious values” or “hostility to the United States, its allies, or its values.” It requires “serious” disciplinary action and the use of force “if necessary” to prevent disruption by demonstrators, and requires open-ended information sharing with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State. 
Given recent government actions to suppress the expression of ideas with which it disagrees, such as the unconstitutional policy of arresting, detaining, and deporting noncitizen students and faculty members for their pro-Palestinian advocacy, this can only be interpreted as a thinly-veiled attempt to restrict academic freedom to those who express government-approved views, defeating the very purpose of academic freedom and of higher education as a whole.

While the loss of federal funding would threaten Miami’s ability to perform its vital education and research work, agreeing to this compact would not forestall that outcome. A concession to threats will simply embolden the Trump administration to come back for more. 
Funding cuts are not insurmountable. For example, the university could temporarily raise the rate of spending on its generous endowment, while collaborating with other institutions to sue for the restoration of unconstitutionally withheld funds. Sacrificing our values, on the other hand, would irreparably damage our university. Miami’s motto, love and honor, obligates us to defend liberal education as a public good and care about all of our students, staff, and faculty. Now is the time to put that principle into practice.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Anti-hunger organizations say they are flying blind as they scramble to address growing food assistance needs after the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled a longstanding food insecurity survey last month.
Groups across the country and in Maine have long used the Household Food Security Report, started under former President Bill Clinton, to measure rates of food insecurity and say it’s an essential tool to understand the scope of hunger in order to address it, according to four experts who spoke to Maine Morning Star. 
But the USDA announcement canceling the survey said the program has “failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.” 
“This data was really important to have an understanding of what the situation is with food insecurity in every community and, without it, it’s really hard to know for anti-hunger organizations whether the work that we’re doing is having any meaningful impact,” said Anna Korsen, deputy director at Full Plates, Full Potential.
“It also means that we can’t see the trends in food insecurity,” she added, noting that by having the survey terminated right after Republicans in Congress passed significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, it “means that they’re basically hiding the evidence.” 
The impact of the myriad cuts to SNAP — whether they are temporary like the pause to benefits driven by the government shutdown, or broader limits on the program, including recently imposed work requirements — will almost certainly make more households food insecure, several experts said. 
The final year captured by the survey is 2024, which means organizations will have to rely on local or state-level data to help direct their efforts going forward.
Increasing reliance on food pantries
Already, food banks are seeing increased demand ahead of their typically busy winter months, according to Hannah Chatalbash, executive director of the Mid Coast Hunger Prevention Program.
The Brunswick-based nonprofit that helps people access food throughout Maine observed a 40% increase in demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which starts in July, compared to the same time period last year. They attribute that to inflation and the rising cost of rent, health care and heating bills for communities, which then turn to food pantries for assistance, Chatalbash said.

“I think families are really getting hit from all sides right now, and when the household budget feels strain, one of the first places people turn to is the local food pantry,” she said.
“We expect that trend to continue to potentially get significantly worse with the news that came out this week about SNAP benefits potentially not being available in November.”
Robin McCarthy, chief advancement officer at Good Shepherd Food Bank, which supplies food to pantries across the state, said there has been roughly a 10% increase this year in the demand at food pantries. That coincides with the slight increase in statewide food insecurity in 2023, the latest year that the USDA data is available for.










All of these cuts and changes together are going to create this tidal wave of food insecurity that is coming towards us. We see it coming, and yet we've just cut the most effective food nutrition assistance program that we have and then hid the evidence of how that will impact households.


– Anna Korsen, Full Plates, Full Potential


It is too soon to tell what the impact of the SNAP cuts will be so far, since many changes to the federal program have not gone into effect yet.  But while food insecurity is on the rise, pantries across the state are seeing a decrease in their food supply because of cuts earlier this year to the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provided banks and pantries with food at no cost, according to Korsen and Chatalbash.
“All of these cuts and changes together are going to create this tidal wave of food insecurity that is coming towards us,” Korsen said. “We see it coming, and yet we’ve just cut the most effective food nutrition assistance program that we have and then hid the evidence of how that will impact households.”
No comprehensive substitute 
The USDA survey was used widely by state and national nonprofit organizations to inform policy that meets the needs of communities that rely on food banks, and more broadly to tackle the issue of food insecurity. 
“There is really no independent reporting that is as comprehensive or of a similar scale to the USDA Household Food Security Report,” Chatalbash said. “It is by far the largest and most comprehensive data set that we have for tracking food insecurity in this country, and so eliminating this report does create a gap in the information that’s available that helps us analyze the problem.”
The Maine Center for Economic Policy (MECEP) has used the USDA survey data in several ways as an overall indicator of economic hardship, according to Economic Policy Analyst James Myall.
For example, in the 2025 legislative fact sheet, USDA survey data helped MECEP map out the percentage of food insecure households in each Maine House of Representatives district. 
The data also informs advocates about the demographics of those most likely to face food insecurity. In Maine, food insecurity is more prevalent in rural parts of the state, especially parts of Aroostook, Piscataquis and Washington counties, where approximately 20% of households lack access to nutritious food, according to the MECEP analysis. 
National trends have shown that single-parent households and people of color are more likely to be food insecure.  
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

“How do we want to help folks not go hungry? You need to know who some of those people are,” Myall said. “So you can sort of identify some of those subgroups and think about what are the barriers that they’re facing in particular, and what are the things we can do to help target them.”
State-level data alternatives
There are some options at the state level to track food insecurity and determine which families need assistance, including the Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey, 
However, that survey, which is administered in schools every two years to measure students’ overall well-being, only includes a snapshot of nutrition.
Myall said the state should consider adding a question “that that would get at food security more broadly.”
“Because that is one of the biggest statewide surveys we have. But the limitation is that it doesn’t get to parents.”
While families with children tend to be less food secure, often it is not children that go hungry, because parents will skip meals if food is limited, Myall said. But that survey, along with free and reduced lunch data collected by schools, are the only ways to ask broad populations in the state about food security currently. 
Feeding America, a national nonprofit organization focused on publishing comprehensive nutrition data, is working on finding alternatives, according to a statement by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.
“As USDA’s report sunsets, there is a risk of losing consistent national benchmarks that have helped guide solutions,” the statement said. “Feeding America is committed to working alongside partners to ensure we continue building on that foundation.”
Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap study provides data that Good Shepherd already relies on and the group, which partners with 600 food assistance organizations across Maine, may start reporting data it collects from those pantries to the national nonprofit to help make up for the lost dataset.
“What that would mean is hopefully being able to use some of the data that we’re already collecting from some of the pantries that we work with,” McCarthy said. “But it’s not comprehensive, and it’s not the same as the USDA data.”

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA — Voters in Lee County elected their first school superintendent in five decades a year ago.
It came two years after voters approved a referendum changing the superintendent position to an elected one. For the previous 50 years, members of the local school board chose who would lead the district. In making that transition, Lee has joined the majority of school districts in Florida (38) that elect their superintendents.
But while that may be the norm in Florida, it’s a complete outlier in the rest of the United States. Among the more than 13,000 school districts in the country, Alabama is the only other state with elected school superintendents.
The state’s largest school districts (such as Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach) have their school superintendents chosen by their school board members. Now a Republican state lawmaker would like to make Hillsborough — the third largest school district in the state and seventh largest in the nation — the latest district with an elected superintendent.

Rep. Michael Owen, a Republican represents southwest Hillsborough and northwest Manatee counties, presented a local bill during a Hillsborough County legislative delegation meeting Tuesday to asscomplish the shift, subject to voter approval.
“I believe Hillsborough County should mirror the majority of the counties in the state of Florida and allow the parents to pick the CEO of their kid’s education,” he said.
When prompted about why he saw the need for such a change, he said he “had a problem” with the fact that the sitting superintendent is less accountable to the voters than he is to members of the school board.
“I believe that having more a independent superintendent will allow them not to necessarily do the wishes of the majority of the board, but the wishes of the parents of Hillsborough County,” he said — stressing that he meant nothing personal against the sitting superintendent, Van Ayres.
If the measure was ultimately approved by the Legislature and then approved in a referendum by the voters, Hillsborough would become the largest school district in the nation that elects its superintendent.
The proposal was attacked by Democrats and some public education advocates in the audience, who said they want less politics in the classroom. Florida voters rejected a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot that would have made school board races officially partisan (the measure did win 55% of the vote, short of the 60% required for passage).
House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell of Tampa noted that Gov. Ron DeSantis appoints the state education commissioner — as has every governor for the past two decades. The last time that the state Education Commissioner was elected, it was Charlie Crist in 2000. The state revised its Constitution in 2003 to make the position appointive.
Rep. Michele Rayner, D-St. Petersburg, attacked the idea, calling it “the ultimate DEI move.”
“Because what we would find, more likely than not, is someone who may not be qualified and may not understand what is important to the people, and most importantly, the children of Hillsborough County when it comes to education,” she said, adding that she was concerned about injecting partisan politics into education.
“What this feels like is a power grab,” she said. “What this feels like is — and I’m going to say the quiet part out loud, because our county is shifting a different way — let’s make sure that we can encapsulate power, and that does not serve students,” she said as the audience cheered.
That change in the power structure of the county was also referenced by Julie Gebhards, a Hillsborough parent and member of Moms for Liberty. She noted that the Hillsborough School Board now consists of five Democrats and two Republicans. As an appointed superintendent, she said, Ayres has to answer to them to maintain job security, while the county itself is more balanced in terms of partisanship (Republicans lead Democrats in voter registration in the county by slightly more than 2%).
“I think it comes down to: Is our superintendent going to be accountable to our students or the board?” she said.
Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, said that while there is common ground that politics does not belong in schools, it is absurd to believe that this specific proposal would lead to an infusion of politics within the classroom.
“The reality is folks, that ship sailed a long time ago,” he said. “I can’t miss the opportunity to just sort of emphasize and draw the point that those arguments can be very easily turned and twisted in the exact opposite direction. So, what’s before you today is not that make-or-break.”
The delegation will meet again before the regular legislative session takes place in January to vote on the proposal. If approved, Rep. Owen will file the measure as a local bill in the House, where it will be assigned to committees and move through the process before going to the full House for consideration. House members are limited to filling seven bills each session but local bills do not count towards this limit.

Call it what you will. It is for everyone. It protects everyone.","Though we needed no reminders, the latest outrages out of Washington have proven that would-be dictators and their empowered henchmen will seek to shut down free speech and hide their misdeeds whenever they can.
But fortunately in Connecticut, government by and for the people has remained much healthier because there are heroes ensuring that our state and municipal meetings, records and officials remain open and accessible and the freedom to speak — to critique and criticize — remains robust.
I am on the board of the Connecticut Foundation for Open Government, which for more than three decades has sought to educate the public about the vital need for freedom of information and, as part of that effort, to honor its champions. We are journalists, lawyers, professors, state and local officials and others dedicated to the notion, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously asserted, “If the broad light of day could be let in upon men’s actions, it would purify them as the sun disinfects.”
We know — and we want the public to know — that open government benefits liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans and everyone in between. All parties and people should be able to see what their public officials are doing and both take part in their decisions or comment on them. 
If they could, they’d understand government better and stop believing the wild conspiracy theories, myths and misinformation that bad actors peddle. Open, transparent, accessible government is bipartisan, or nonpartisan. Call it what you will. It is for everyone. It protects everyone.
President Trump, sadly, dangerously, doesn’t agree.
In just the last month, he’s had his FCC chairman threaten TV networks unless they stifle Jimmy Kimmel and other critics. He’s had his Attorney General threaten to prosecute people for “hate” speech — ie. commentary that criticizes Trump — and has had his Defense Secretary attempt to deny press credentials to journalists who fail to pledge that they will eschew independent fact-gathering and report only the information offered via press release by the Pentagon. His vice president has told everyone to report critiques of Charlie Kirk and other matters to their employers in hopes those uttering them will be fired.
Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans and the Justice Department refuse to release the Epstein files, the FBI refuses to release the tape of immigration czar Tom Homan allegedly accepting cash in a paper bag from those wanting border security contracts and the administration refuses to produce documents, tapes or other evidence that the Venezuelan boats it’s blown out of the water were actually smuggling drugs.
Information is not free in this administration. Government is not transparent.
But here in Connecticut, the Freedom of Information Act is celebrating its 50th anniversary. There are those, to be sure, that want to limit access to public records and keep government meetings closed to the public. But the overwhelming majority of state and local officials — led by the Freedom of Information Commission, leadership in the General Assembly and hundreds of sterling mayors, first selectmen, town clerks and town councilors — are keeping records available and meetings open.
Last week, more than 100 guardians of those rights gathered at the Mark Twain House & Museum to honor some of those heroes. 
Among them:
The Republican and Democratic leaders of the state House of Representatives, Vincent Candelora and Jason Rojas, who have distinguished themselves in recent years, but particularly this year, by defending government transparency in the face of determined efforts to shield government actions from the public. 
As leaders admired by their respective caucuses, they are both uncommonly influential when they take a stand on issues, and have proven their philosophical opposition to government secrecy when they review proposed legislation. This year, in contrast to Washington, where compromise and bipartisan agreement is almost nonexistent, they were instrumental in promoting sincere caucus-to-caucus discussion that ultimately defeated bills that would have kept hidden higher education records pertaining to teaching or research; restricted access to voter records; permitted public review of complaints against police and corrections officers only after they had been “investigated and adjudicated by the proper legal authority;” and allowed school superintendents to attend closed executive sessions of boards of education, without limitation, creating a slippery slope that in future years might have unleashed unlimited closed sessions by councils, boards of selectmen and other public bodies.
The Housing Collective, which works to create affordable homes across Connecticut. Each week, it publishes a comprehensive listing of land-use commission meetings’ times, locations and agendas — where housing creation decisions are made so residents can attend and voice concerns, along with a list of vacancies on land-use boards so residents can seek appointment or election, and complemented by explanations of what land-use boards are empowered to decide and information on how to understand their actions and offer input. 
If every policy organization in Connecticut — environmental, public health, education — did the same, government would be more visible and less mysterious, and Connecticut residents would be less inclined to believe the misinformation and conspiracy theories fed to them by those trying to mislead them.
Journalist Katherine Revello, of CT Inside Investigator, who wrote more than 150 pieces in the last year explaining the Freedom of Information Act and open meetings law.
Colleen M. Murphy, the current executive director and general counsel of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, received a special award for her steadfast advocacy of open government in her 35 years as an FOI attorney and her 20 years as the commission’s leader. She is widely respected as a fair, objective, brilliant attorney, and is a sought-after speaker nationally on government transparency, privacy and FOI issues.
The honor they all received — The Mitchell W. Pearlman Freedom of Information Award — is named after the first executive director of the state FOI Commission and the father of the state’s FOI Act. He attended the ceremony, standing to the side, smiling.
We will all have a reason to keep smiling if government records, officials and meetings remain open and accessible. But “government of the people, by the people, for the people” will, as Lincoln understood, perish from the earth if the abuses out of Washington continue and spread. Democracy will only remain alive if we ensure that “We the People” — all the people — can see, petition and shape their government.
The heroes honored last week were richly deserving. But they can’t do it alone. We have to be heroes, too.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 04:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Setting the record straight on UConn paid leave provisions,Stephanie Reitz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/setting-the-record-straight-on-uconn-paid-leave-provisions/,Being able to recruit and retain the best faculty means ensuring the negotiated pay and benefits the university offers are highly competitive.,"UConn is home to about 1,700 tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty on its Storrs and regional campuses. They are responsible for delivering a world-class education to our 34,000-plus students, along with conducting research and producing meaningful scholarship in their fields.
 Based on statements in Monday’s op-ed (“This is UConn: Zero Paid Leave for Professors”), the University wants to ensure that our faculty, elected officials, and other Connecticut residents have accurate, precise information on medical and family leave afforded to faculty, along with their free speech and academic freedom protections.
Specifically, the provisions applicable to faculty are as follows:

UConn abides by all federal and state laws for its employees, including those providing job-protected family and medical leave, disability accommodations, and paid sick leave.
Every tenured and tenure-track UConn faculty member is entitled to six months of paid leave for their own qualifying medical condition, with potential for up to 24 months. The same provision applies for CIRE (clinical, in-residence, and extension) faculty with at least three years of UConn employment.
An employee’s own qualifying medical condition includes the six to eight weeks of recovery following childbirth, and may also apply to other pregnancy-related conditions such as postpartum depression.
For CIRE faculty not yet eligible for the six-month paid leave, six to eight weeks of paid sick leave is typically granted for the employee’s own medical condition, including post-childbirth recovery. UConn is aware of no cases in which a faculty member or any other employee was expected to return to work only a short duration after giving birth.
Faculty who experience a major life event – including birth or adoption of a child – can have their duties modified in the semester or year following the event. A faculty member who is a birth/adoptive parent or primary caregiver is eligible for release from on-site duties such as classroom teaching, and would be assigned alternative duties that can be performed more flexibly. A faculty member who is a secondary caregiver may similarly work with their department head to modify their duties.
To ensure that such instances don’t derail their career path, tenure-track faculty are granted an additional year on their tenure clock if they have taken qualified family and/or medical leave, or experience a qualifying major life event as defined in federal and/or state family and/or medical leave laws.
These provisions are available whether faculty work on a full-year appointment or the nine-month term, which runs concurrent with the academic year without summer duties.

UConn administrators are covered by other provisions which may, but do not necessarily, provide for full pay during family leave:

Management and confidential (non-union) employees at UConn receive or accrue paid time off, such as sick, vacation, and personal leave. These leave balances may be used to continue an employee’s pay during a qualifying family or medical leave.
There are no provisions for modification of work duties for management or confidential employees.
They are subject to a 0.5% payroll tax to help fund the Connecticut Paid Leave program, and therefore may avail themselves of that program under qualifying circumstances. It provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave benefits, but does not fully replace wages.
The UConn faculty union, like other state employee unions, could negotiate to have its members participate in the program and be subject to the payroll tax in return for the benefit, but the union has not proposed to do so.

Separately, UConn has been informed through media outlet inquiries, including the Connecticut Mirror, of questions about protection of academic freedom. UConn is deeply committed to academic freedom, seeing it as fundamental to our mission as a public research university.
As such, its importance is enshrined in the current AAUP contract and in the University Bylaws, which provide significant detail on the full freedom to teach, research, publish, and engage in open inquiry and expression, consistent with the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.
Prospective students apply to UConn for many reasons, including our vibrant campuses, an outstanding student experience, and the exceptional value we offer Connecticut residents compared to other institutions. But the single most important reason our students want to attend and graduate from UConn is the outstanding education we offer. This is in part why a record-breaking 62,000 people applied to UConn this year.
The key to this is our exceptional faculty, supported by our hard-working staff. Being able to recruit and retain the very best means ensuring that the negotiated pay and benefits we offer are highly competitive and that, at UConn, faculty are guaranteed the academic freedom that is an essential component of their teaching and research.
We are proud that we are able to continue to offer both, supporting our workforce and helping UConn to successfully carry out its mission on behalf of Connecticut.

Republicans want to account for a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a case that could dramatically reshape Louisiana’s six congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections – a ruling that several other states are watching as they ponder redrawing their maps.
The front-running proposals from the Republican-run legislature – House Bill 1 and identical Senate Bill 1 – push next year’s primary schedule back by roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 27.

Procedural efforts from Democrats in both chambers failed to keep the bills from being moved to their committees.

It remains to be seen whether this one-month adjustment would be enough time to account for whatever ruling the Supreme Court issues on Callais v. Louisiana. A group of white voters have challenged the constitutionality of the 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers crafted in 2024 to account for the state’s Black population reaching nearly one-third according to the 2020 census. U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-New Orleans, won an election later in the year to fill that seat, giving Louisiana two Black members in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Republicans might be banking on a ruling from justices before Dec. 8, the end of the monthlong congressional qualifying period in Texas, said Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus. The Texas Legislature switched five of its U.S. House seats to favor Republicans earlier this year in a map that’s also being challenged in federal court.
Jordan said a ruling on the Callais case in the coming weeks would play into Republicans’ strategy in both states and others that want to update their maps to add more GOP districts.
“What they’re doing is trying to give themselves the greatest amount of time in an effort to really take away the voting strength of minority voters,” he said.
Debate began in earnest on Senate Bill 1 in a Thursday afternoon committee hearing that grew heated when Sens. Gary Carter of New Orleans and Sam Jenkins of Lake Charles, both Black Democrats, grilled Kleinpeter on his date-changing proposal.
“This is like you’re a kid and finding out there’s no Santa Claus,” Carter said, arguing the date changes would illegally “interfere” with next year’s congressional elections.
Carter’s uncle, U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, also testified at the hearing and urged senators to “pump the breaks.”
“Let’s answer the tough questions. Let’s hear everyone out and then proceed with caution,” Troy Carter said in an interview. “But to act prematurely before the Supreme Court has even digested fully the arguments [in Callais] is probably not a good way to do it.”
The Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee advanced the Senate Bill 1 to the floor in an 5-3 party-line vote. The panel also approved Senate Bill 2, which moves the election date for five constitutional amendments from the April 18 ballot to May 16.
Through the first day of the session, lawmakers have not yet discussed at length the scenario of a Supreme Court decision in the Callais case coming later in the spring. Robert Collins, a public policy professor at Dillard University, said Gov. Jeff Landry’s decision to convene lawmakers to move election dates comes with some political risk. It depends on justices ruling in time for the legislature to redraw congressional maps before the start of the 2026 election calendar.
“He’s gambling that he’s going to get the ruling when he needs it, and you can only push back the date so far,” Collins said.
The stage for the current special session was set in early January 2024 when Landry urged lawmakers to add the second Black district rather than allow a federal court to redraw a map from 2022 that had just one majority-Black congressional district. The governor convened legislators just days after he took office for what was the third redistricting special session in 14 months. Republicans had previously rejected any map that added a second majority-Black congressional district.
Republican Attorney General Murrill, who defended Louisiana second Black district, has since sided with the plaintiffs to argue the process used to craft its boundaries – which zig-zags horizontally between Baton Rouge and Shreveport – is an illegal racial gerrymander. Specifically, she maintains Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act clashes with the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that discriminate based on race, color or membership in a language minority group. ​The two amendments cover, in part, representation in Congress and racial discrimination in voting.
Murrill’s solicitor general, Benjamin Aguiñaga, argued Oct. 15 before the Supreme Court that race was illegally used to create Louisiana’s 6th Congressional District. Questions from conservative justices seemed to align with his points.
As recently as this August, Landry had been pushing lawmakers to meet for yet another special redistricting session, well before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Louisiana case. But legislative leaders pushed back, arguing that it would be pointless to draw new maps without knowing whether justices would require Louisiana to include two, one or no majority-Black congressional districts.

Third District Judge Dianna Gibson rarely spoke during Thursday’s hearing, except a few times to sustain objections from legislative attorneys about leading questions. Largely, Gibson listened quietly as plaintiffs questioned their experts’ methods in painstaking detail. 
Utah lawmakers and plaintiffs accuse each other of gerrymandering with dueling redistricting experts

Early Friday, the evidentiary hearing is expected to continue with testimony from the Legislature’s retained experts. 
But Thursday morning, the hearing started with Jowei Chen, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan, calling the map advanced by the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature — known as map C — an “extreme partisan outlier” that favors Republicans. 
Chen said that when he analyzed 10,000 computer simulated maps drawn with a program designed to prioritize the neutral redistricting criteria listed by Proposition 4 — the 2018 voter-approved law requiring an independent redistricting process in Utah — more than 99% of the program’s map simulations created a Democratic-leaning district because of the state’s “political geography.”
In GOP-dominated Utah, Republicans for years have consistently won statewide races, with Republican voters making up about two-thirds of registered voters. Democrats, however, are concentrated in the state’s most populated county, Salt Lake County, and make up roughly a third of the state’s voters. 
Map C, Chen said, “cracked” Democratic voters by splitting Salt Lake County in half and creating four safe Republican districts — a result he said almost never observed in his 10,000-map simulation that was programmed to follow Proposition 4’s map-drawing criteria.

“That is what makes it an extreme partisan outlier,” Chen said. 
Chen also picked apart methods used by the Legislature’s redistricting expert, Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics, who drew map C. Chen said Trende’s maps were flawed from the beginning because they were drawn with software that was not programmed to prioritize Proposition 4’s criteria, which calls for the prioritization of minimizing city and county splits, maximizing geographic compactness, and keeping communities of interest together. 
Chen said Trende’s use of a statistical tool called the partisan bias test effectively “filters out” any map with a Democratic-leaing district. 
“Essentially if a plan has a Democratic district, it’s almost certainly going to fail the partisan bias test,” Chen said. “That partisan bias test is essentially just a filter for whether or not a map has a Democratic district or not.”
Chen and another one of the plaintiffs’ experts — Chris Warshaw, a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University — also testified that the partisan bias test is not an “appropriate” tool to use in a state like Utah that has only four congressional seats and has uncompetitive statewide races (for years Republicans have won by wide margins).

Trende and the Legislature’s other redistricting experts are expected to testify and be cross-examined during the second day of the hearing on Friday. 
Warshaw said the partisan bias test and the mean-median difference metrics — tests that Utah lawmakers required in a recently-passed law, SB1011, to analyze congressional maps — both “don’t work well in Utah.” Gibson is also expected to weigh in on a separate request from the plaintiffs to block that law from taking effect following a hearing scheduled for Nov. 5.

“I believe it’s not among the best available measures,” Warshaw said of the mean-median difference test. “In fact it’s among the worst measures and is not applicable in Utah.” 
Though Warshaw acknowledged that his preferred method, the efficiency gap test, has its limitations because Utah only has four congressional districts, he said it’s a better metric to test for fairness — and that map-drawers should also pair it with other statistical tests. 
“Where it’s appropriate we should use multiple metrics to push on the robustness of our conclusions,” he said. 
Victoria and Malcolm Reid, two of the plaintiffs that are suing the state, also testified Thursday. The Reids live in Millcreek — a city that was split four times by the 2021 congressional map that has since been struck down by the courts. 
The Legislature’s preferred map that’s been submitted to the court would still split Millcreek, but only once compared to four times. Still, Malcolm Reid said he believes the two alternative maps drawn by the plaintiffs would be more fair because they would keep his community whole and not “dilute” his voice. 
“It hurts half as much,” Malcolm Reid said of the Legislature’s map C. “We’re down to two congressional districts instead of four, (but) we can still walk to the east, walk to the south, walk to the north, and be in a different congressional district. … It effectively keeps Millcreek divided.”

The Supreme Court is responsible for d[...],"Michael Gableman | Up Front screen shotWisconsin Supreme Court Justice Susan Crawford issued an order Thursday recusing herself from former Justice Michael Gableman’s disciplinary case with the state Office of Lawyer Regulation. 
Gableman faces a suspension of his law license for his conduct during his widely derided review of the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court is responsible for delivering the length of his suspension and determining any monetary penalties he’s responsible for paying. 
Crawford’s recusal comes after Gableman had filed a motion requesting that she not participate in the case because of comments she made about him on the campaign trail earlier this year. However, Crawford isn’t recusing at Gableman’s request. 
Instead, Crawford wrote, she is stepping aside from weighing in on the case because part of the allegations against Gableman are his actions during an open records lawsuit against him in the circuit court of Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Crawford, formerly a judge in that circuit, said that because of her proximity to Remington’s court, she learned facts about that case that are not considered part of the official record in the disciplinary matter. 
“I believe it is likely I was exposed to information and impressions related to Attorney Gableman’s conduct and demeanor in the circuit court that fall outside of the record before this court,” she wrote. “Because I may have been exposed to factual allegations beyond those Attorney Gableman has chosen not to contest, I may have ‘personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.’”
Because she recused herself for another reason, Crawford dismissed Gableman’s request as moot.
Gableman had also requested the recusal of Justice Rebecca Dallet, arguing that comments she made about his judicial record when she announced her campaign for the Court in 2017 meant she couldn’t impartially assess his case. In an order, Dallet denied the request, writing that her comments about him in 2017 have nothing to do with how she assesses actions he took in 2021. 
“Although Gableman tries to characterize my comments as reflecting a view of ‘Gableman’s moral turpitude,’ and his ‘professional judgment and character,’ no objective reasonable observer would understand them as such,” she wrote. “Simply put, I expressed my disagreement with Gableman’s actions as a candidate and justice between 2008 and 2018. That disagreement is irrelevant to whether he engaged in attorney misconduct in 2021 and 2022, and whether I can impartially adjudicate claims that he did so now.”
With Crawford recusing, the Court is divided 3-3 between liberals and conservatives — though conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn has previously sided with the Court’s liberals in cases relating to the 2020 presidential election.

At an event in Washington, D.C. that was dubbed “Alaska Day” by the federal department, Burgum signed a series of documents pertaining to all three projects as well as an ongoing effort by the federal government to give land to the families of Alaska Native Vietnam War veterans.
“This is our first, this won’t be our last, Alaska Day. We have a lot more things to accomplish, a lot more things to celebrate going forward,” said Burgum, flanked by Gov. Mike Dunleavy and all three members of the state’s congressional delegation.
“I told the president, it’s like Christmas every morning,” said Dunleavy. “I wake up, I go to look at what’s under the proverbial Christmas tree to see what’s happening. And here’s another example of more presents for not just Alaska, but for this country.”
Tribal and environmental groups opposed to the three development projects saw Thursday’s action differently, with Defenders of Wildlife, a national group, dubbing the event “Alaska Sellout Day.”
“Today’s announcements are the latest step in Donald Trump’s plan to sell out our wildest landscape and natural heritage to corporate polluters,” said Dan Ritzman, director of conservation for the Sierra Club. 
What was done on Thursday
Burgum signed previously announced permits for the 211-mile Ambler Road, which is intended to connect the Dalton Highway with a series of potential mine sites in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska.
He also signed a record of decision for the federal government’s oil and gas drilling program in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge of northeast Alaska. 
That re-establishes a program that had been in place during the first term of President Donald Trump but which was subsequently reversed by President Joe Biden.
Burgum also reversed the Biden administration’s decision to suspend oil and gas leases issued by the federal government in 2020 to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority.
Barring further litigation, that move clears the way for AIDEA — Alaska’s state-owned development bank — to begin seismic surveys that could reveal the amount of oil available within parts of the Arctic refuge’s coastal plain.
While the Ambler and ANWR actions effectively took the projects back to where they stood in 2020, the King Cove road is now closer to construction at any point in its decades-long development process.
Envisioned as a gravel road between King Cove and an all-weather airport at Cold Bay, the road would pass through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, a nationally important bird sanctuary. 
Eleven miles of new road are needed to link existing roads to the two towns, but those 11 miles would pass through a wilderness area. 
On Thursday, Burgum signed documents that complete a land exchange between King Cove Corp., the local Alaska Native corporation, and the federal government. King Cove Corp. gives up about 31,200 acres to expand the refuge, and in return, it receives the 490 acres of refuge land needed to complete the road.
In a move with more limited statewide impact, Burgum signed paperwork awarding three Alaska Native Vietnam War veterans with 160-acre plots of land under a federal allotment program. As of March, 453 veterans and their families had requested plots authorized under legislation authored by Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan.
For King Cove, a medevac-avoiding road moves forward
King Cove’s airport is frequently closed by bad weather, and since 2014, there have been more than 100 Coast Guard medevacs from the community because regular air ambulance service was unavailable. 
Murkowski, who has previously vowed to complete the road, noted that this is the third time that the federal government has embarked on a land exchange for the road, with the prior two attempts blocked and reversed by litigation.
“We’ve reached a point with the King Cove exchange that we haven’t yet before, and that’s actually the official patent being issued to KCC, so we’re one step further. I think that’s important,” she said.
The road, though supported by local residents, is opposed by some Yukon-Kuskokwim river delta tribal leaders and subsistence bird hunters who fear its effects on wildlife.
“Surely, the people of King Cove can see the value of leaving the habitat for so many species intact would be far more valuable than any road could be,” said  Angutekaraq Estelle Thomson, Traditional Council President of the Native Village of Paimiut, one of several communities that have supported lawsuits seeking to prevent road construction.
Rebecca Noblin, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who has fought the road on behalf of several area villages, said Thursday that “we have significant questions about the legality of the exchange. We, along with the Native Villages of Hooper Bay and Paimiut, expect to bring those issues to court soon. Road construction will also require additional permits, including an Army Corps 404 permit and Endangered Species Act consultation, so this is far from a done deal.”
With Ambler and ANWR, a triumph of economics over environment
On the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued an executive order seeking to encourage oil and gas development, mining and logging in Alaska.

Elected officials said they see Thursday’s actions in line with that decision. 
Alaska Republican Rep. Nick Begich said projects like the Ambler Road and ANWR drilling matter because they create jobs.
“We need the jobs. We need high-paying, good jobs, and these resource industry jobs fit that bill completely. And so whether it’s mining, timber, oil and gas development or other resources, these are necessary for the functioning of Alaska’s economy,” he said.
The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is believed to contain billions of barrels of recoverable oil that could be sold on global markets. 
Sullivan noted that previous North Slope oil development has been good for the region’s residents. 
“The life expectancy, mostly of the Native people in our state, has increased in the North Slope and the Northwest Arctic Borough and by dramatic numbers … and a lot of that is due to the benefits that come from responsible resource development: jobs, revenues, water and sewer, gymnasiums, health clinics. So it’s a real life and death issue,” he said.
The predominantly Alaska Native town of Kaktovik is located on Barter Island, within the refuge.
“Developing ANWR’s Coastal Plain is vital for Kaktovik’s future,” said the town’s mayor, Nathan Gordon Jr., in a written statement. “Taxation of development infrastructure in our region funds essential services across the North Slope, including water and sewer systems to clinics, roads, and first responders. Today’s actions by the federal government create the conditions for these services to remain available and for continued progress for our communities.”
To date, no oil companies have shown interest in drilling within the refuge, leaving only Alaska’s state-owned development bank, which won leases in a 2020 sale, to work there.
So far, no actual work has taken place because of repeated lawsuits seeking to overturn the sale.
The bank, which has filed several lawsuits over federal restrictions on drilling within the refuge, did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Several legal challenges to the 2020 ANWR plan of development — which was restored Thursday — are still pending in federal court. 
Some of those challenges revolve around the possible effects that ANWR development and the burning of those fossil fuels will have on climate change.
Thursday’s announcement came just a week after the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastated coastal communities in southwestern Alaska. Experts say that storm was worsened by climate change.
Murkowski said she does not shy away “from the fact that the impact of that typhoon was made more fierce and more destructive because it was able to travel over a large body of what is now warmer, open ocean with lack of ice. I get that, and I call it climate change.”
At the same time, people worldwide are continuing to consume fossil fuels. Murkowski said that for her, the choice is straightforward: Will they get those fossil fuels from Alaska or some place with worse environmental standards?
“I’d much rather be producing in Alaska, than just across the Bering Strait there, over in Russia, where I don’t think that they respect the same level of environmental standards and safeguards,” she said. “So is it complicated? Yes. But am I proud of how Alaska has led in terms of meeting environmental standards that are amongst the highest in the world? I am.” 
What comes next for Ambler, King Cove and ANWR?
All three development projects boosted by the federal government on Thursday are a long way from construction, both supporters and detractors say.
In all three cases, proponents need to obtain additional federal permits and will have to cope with lawsuits brought by opponents.
The environmental law firm Earthjustice has repeatedly been involved in lawsuits against the federal government over the issue of arctic refuge drilling.
“Interior has re-adopted the maximally destructive plan from President Trump’s first term,” said Earthjustice attorney Erik Grafe, by email on Thursday. “That plan was unlawful in 2020 and is still unlawful today. The bedrock environmental laws that protect the Arctic Refuge’s irreplaceable natural resources remain despite Congress passing reconciliation bills on leasing in the refuge.” 
The Gwich’in Steering Committee, represented by attorneys from Trustees for Alaska, is among the organizations that have repeatedly sued to block drilling in ANWR. 
The committee is concerned about the effect that refuge development would have on local caribou herds used by subsistence hunters. In a statement, the committee’s executive director, Kristen Moreland, implied that further litigation will come.
“This action by the Trump administration is a direct attack on the Gwich’in, who have for decades been a voice for the caribou and stood against the destruction of the Arctic Refuge. A leasing program that would open the entire Coastal Plain completely ignores the impacts that oil and gas development would have on the land, on wildlife, and on our communities,” she said.
“We condemn these efforts by the Trump administration to exploit the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou herd for short-term gain, and we know that we are not alone. We will continue to raise our voices and fight for the protection of this sacred land and for our way of life.”

Gov. Kelly Armstrong argued the Ethics Commission needs a “general reset,” citing a strained relationship with executive branch agencies. Armstrong also strongly disagreed with a response Sagsveen gave during the selection process in which he said the North Dakota Legislature has passed laws to limit the commission’s authority, in violation of the state constitution. 
“I just won’t vote for him,” Armstrong said.

However, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, the other two members of the selection committee, strongly support reappointing Sagsveen. The appointment requires a consensus of the three members, not a majority vote.
Hogan, D-Fargo, cited the need to maintain continuity on the commission because it has only begun finding its feet seven years after it was created. Hogue, R-Minot, said he was impressed by Sagsveen’s written responses to a questionnaire issued by the committee.
“I think he’s the top pick,” Hogue said of Sagsveen, even though the two men don’t agree on everything. “He’s too strong in so many other areas to overlook him.”
Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney with extensive government experience, was appointed to the Ethics Commission last September to fill the remainder of a term for Paul Richard, who retired. Sagsveen is seeking a four-year term.
The terms of commissioner Ward Koeser and Sagsveen expired Aug. 31 but they are continuing to serve until vacancies are filled. The third vacancy was caused by the death of Dave Anderson, the board chair, in May. The appointment to fill that seat will expire Aug. 31, 2026.
The finalists supported by all three members of the selection committee are Pam Sharp, former director of the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget, Jared Huibregtse, a project manager for a Mandan engineering firm, and Mark Western, a Fargo attorney. 
The committee adjourned without making a decision, with Hogan and Hogue continuing to advocate for Sagsveen.
“We’ve actually seen him working in this position,” Hogan said, emphasizing the need to maintain continuity on the Ethics Commission now that the board and legislative leadership have begun establishing a positive working relationship. “I feel like we have been moving in a good direction together.”
Armstrong referenced the strained relationship between the Ethics Commission and the Attorney General’s Office as he suggested the need for a “level reset” to improve communication with legislative and executive branches. 
“Drew is an incredibly intense advocate who is very passionate about the things he’s passionate about,” said Armstrong, referring to Attorney General Drew Wrigley. 
Sagsveen in his written response to questions called the relationship with the attorney general  “problematic” because he “consistently disparages the professionalism and competence of the Commission’s Executive Director.”
Sagsveen also cited the state constitution, which says laws may not hamper or restrict the Ethics Commission, which was created by the voters. “However, laws have been enacted to limit the authority of the Commission,” he wrote.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Armstrong pushed back on that answer during Thursday’s meeting. 
“I don’t think the Legislature has acted unconstitutionally,” Armstrong said. “I think the answer, I mean, really quite frankly bothers me.”
Armstrong and Hogue said they oppose a recent advisory opinion issued by the commission because it has a significant impact on the secretary of state’s administration of campaign finance law and encroaches on the Legislature’s authority to enact laws. 
Hogue, however, said he was pleased by Sagsveen’s “constructive response” after Armstrong voiced his concerns about the opinion during a public hearing.
“What impressed me was he was pretty open and shared a willingness to say, ‘All right, we should have collaborations because we had no idea those concerns were out there in the executive branch,’” Hogue said. 
Sagsveen, reached after the selection committee’s meeting, declined to comment. 
“I don’t want to say anything to interfere with the selection process,” Sagsveen said.
The committee will reconvene at 2 p.m. Friday to resume its discussion. 
The Legislature earlier this year rejected the Ethics Commission’s request for an additional staff member and a bill the commission said would have helped speed up investigations. The offices of the governor and attorney general also argued this year that the commission does not have the authority to create or impose penalties for ethics-related violations.

Interim LSU President Matt Lee, McNeese State President Wade Rousse, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins, University of South Carolina Vice President of Research Julius Fridriksson and Tulane University Vice President of Research Giovanni Piedimonte were identified on the list of candidates invited to apply. 
One of the candidates on the committee’s list of top five applicants for matching their desired qualifications, identified only by a number, will be invited to apply only if they disclose their name publicly. 
“Whether they apply or not is up to them, and if so, they’ll be invited to interview,” LSU general counsel Trey Jones said. 
Rousse is the favored candidate of LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, who is also a Lake Charles resident. He is rumored to be the most likely candidate to get the job. Rousse has been president of McNeese State University since May 2024. He’s held several administrative positions at the university since 2019. 
Lee, who has served as interim since former President William Tate left the position in June, is LSU’s vice president for agriculture and dean of the College of Agriculture. Lee has worked at LSU, first as a sociology professor and then as an administrator, since 2004. He also received his doctorate degree from LSU. 
The decision to go public with applicants’ names comes days after search committee members were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements that would have required them to remain silent on candidate names until they officially applied.  LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard indicated Thursday the university had moved away from that stance, saying the original intent of the agreements was to protect the applicants.
“We just said, ‘Y’all are on record.’ We’re tired,” Ballard said.
The search committee is expected to meet again Oct. 29 to publicly interview the applicants and select three finalists. Those finalists will then meet with various university interest groups, including as faculty and students, with the Board of Supervisors meeting shortly afterward to make the final hiring decision.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-20-23_LSU_MP-10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 20:16:47.810651

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho’s DOGE Task Force is preparing to recommend potential state employee position eliminations as well as agency, board and commission repeals or mergers. 
The legislative task force, named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency, voted Thursday at a meeting in Boise to allow the co-chairs to provide state budget writers with information on long-term vacancies at the interim budget meeting in November. 
DOGE members also heard a staff report on the first 13 potential agency eliminations or consolidations, with more planned for consideration. 
Task force co-Chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said Thursday the members would evaluate information compiled by legislative staff and hear from heads of the agencies to make recommendations at next month’s meeting. 
The task force may study issues and provide recommendations, but cannot pass legislation. Its recommendations will go to the germane legislative committee for consideration and a vote before going through the rest of the legislative process through the Idaho House and Idaho Senate. 
 Task force considers recommending elimination of longstanding vacant positions statewide 

Legislative staff compiled and presented a list of all the agency employee positions that had been authorized and funded but not filled for the past six months, which totaled 381 positions.
Ehlers noted to lawmakers that he and co-Chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, would be presenting findings from the task force at the budget-writing Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, meeting in early November, and said he’d entertain a motion to provide the report to the budget writers with the recommendation that the positions and their associated funding be eliminated. 
The task force’s sole Democrat, Sen. Carrie Semmelroth of Boise, asked if there was a way that agencies could be reached about the necessity of each position to the functioning of the agency before the group recommended elimination. 
Republican Rep. Dustin Manwaring of Pocatello, also thought the task force didn’t have enough information to recommend a full elimination, but thought JFAC members should have the information. 
“That’s what I think JFAC’s job will be, is to dig into the weeds on some of these,” Manwaring said. 
Some of the vacant positions included trial attorneys for the newly established State Public Defender’s Office, which Manwaring highlighted as wanting to have more time for those to be filled before removing their funding. 
Other positions included in the report were Idaho State Police troopers, several nurses with the Division of Veterans Services, Idaho Department of Transportation engineers and technicians, and a number of health care provider and social worker-related positions at the Department of Health and Welfare. 
Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, made a motion that the task force direct the co-chairs to provide the report to JFAC for its members’ “review, consideration and research” for possible removal of positions. 
Members unanimously voted to provide the report without a specific recommendation.

 DOGE members look to eliminate seven state entities, move seven more under other agencies

Jared Tatro, of the Legislative Services Office’s Impact Review Team, provided an overview of items legislators on the task force had identified as “low-hanging fruit,” for elimination and consolidation, many of which are no longer used or active: 

Eliminate OnePlan Executive Group; a now-defunct conservation planner. 
Eliminate Big Payette Lake Water Quality Council and Citizens Committee 
Eliminate Columbia Compact Commission 
Eliminate Junior College District – Dormitory Housing Commision 
Merge Bingo-Raffle Advisory Board with Idaho Lottery Commission 
Move STEM Action Center into Workforce Development Council 
Merge Sheep and Goat Health Board with Department of Agriculture 
Eliminate State Brand Board 
Eliminate Idaho Honey Commission 
Move State Brand Inspector into Department of Agriculture
Move Soil & Water Commission into Department of Water Resources
Move Office of Species Conservation into Office of Energy and Mineral Resources 
Eliminate Regional Committees for Early Intervention Services 

Some of the eliminations may be done through work under the Idaho Code Cleanup Act, which passed this year and directed agencies to identify sections of code that are redundant, unnecessary or out-of-date. 
Tatro told lawmakers staff would be diving into questions about feasibility, such as whether lottery commissioners had adequate knowledge and resources to advise charitable gaming and that lawmakers would need to consider questions such as if bingo and raffles needed to be regulated at the same level going forward. 
 North Idaho representative urges task force not to eliminate lake commission 

In addition to the 13 elimination and merging options presented, Ehlers asked task force members Thursday to look at a larger list of about 70 possibilities that he previously presented, and recommend 10 more to research and consider. 
The list to consider “further review” included the Pend Oreille Basin Commission, which advises the state on North Idaho water quality and quantity issues. 
Rep. Mark Sauter, R-Sandpoint, who is not a member of the task force, told its members during the public comment period that the commission is vital to the area, and urged them not to remove it. He said it deals with issues related to federal authorities over a dam in the area. 
“It started out as an issue with Army Corps of Engineers, federal Fish and Game, federal endangered species, you name it,” Sauter said. “So it was just to push back against federal overreach, and we’ve been fighting ever since.” 
The DOGE Task Force plans to meet again Nov. 19.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins asked the Trump administration to consider all potential options for continuing the country’s largest nutrition assistance program that is set to be paused next month due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
Collins, who is chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins Thursday, asking her to explore the possibility of using contingency funds, offering partial payments or other legal options for ensuring the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, continues next month. 
The letter comes after the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states earlier this week that the program’s November benefits won’t be issued because of the federal shutdown, which has now persisted for more than three weeks. More than 42 million low-income Americans, including 170,000 in Maine, rely on the program to buy food each month. 
“The needless and reckless government shutdown directed by Senator Schumer is putting federal nutrition assistance for these individuals at risk,” Collins said in her letter.
Maine food security advocates call on Collins to release contingency funds for SNAP benefits

While Collins said she will continue to work with her colleagues to “end this damaging shutdown,” she asked Rollins to take swift action to maintain the benefits in the interim. 
On Wednesday, a new coalition of food security advocates and organizations in Maine made a similar request of Collins in a letter asking her to release SNAP’s contingency funds to allow for the continuation of partial payments. 
Collins’ request to Rollins echoes that of Senate Democrats, who also sent a letter to Rollins Wednesday that contended the agency has the resources to keep payments flowing.
“We were deeply disturbed to hear that the USDA has instructed states to stop processing SNAP benefits for November and were surprised by your recent comments that the program will ‘run out of money in two weeks,’” reads the letter. “In fact, the USDA has several tools available which would enable SNAP benefits to be paid through or close to the end of November.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill Wednesday to continue SNAP funding through the shutdown. During Thursday’s briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would “absolutely support” the legislation.

(Courtesy of Conzett Architecture and Collective Development) OMAHA — A quilt mural reflecting assorted cultures and populations of an Omaha neighborhood will be featured on a $2.5 million townhome project funded in part with a state grant.
Ground preparation is underway at the long vacant 29th and Jackson Streets site, where six market-rate rental townhomes are to rise in a historically diverse section of Nebraska’s largest city.
Supporters gathered Thursday at a different venue to share details of the initiative, which is part of a three-pronged application by Marta Sonia Lodoño Mejía of Midwest Businesses &  Projects LLC. In all, the applicant was awarded $5.8 million from the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development and targeting neighborhoods hurt disproportionately by the COVID-19 pandemic.
$5.8 million state award helps launch ‘Global Market’ in South Omaha

About $1 million of the $5.8 million will fuel development of the townhomes led by Max Honaker and Ben Katt of Collective Development. The remainder goes to creation of the South Omaha Global Market and an expansion of the International Bakery, both along the South 24th Street corridor.
Also assisting the “29th and Jackson Townhomes” is $200,445 in public tax-increment financing approved by the City of Omaha. 
Designed for families, each townhome will include four bedrooms, about 2,000 square feet and a two-car tandem garage. Rent is expected to be $2,500, said Honaker.
A highlight of the housing is the mural that will be coordinated by the South Omaha Mural Project, a force behind 16 other murals and one sculpture that dot the “Magic City” known as a landing spot for immigrant and newcomer groups, including Irish, Polish, Czech, Lithuanian, African American, Mexican and Maya.
The future mural will be different in that it is to be a patchwork of designs — each representing a distinct culture or population — pieced together to convey unity, said Richard Harrison, an artist and business owner who created the South Omaha Mural Project series. 
“We are woven together,” he said of the theme. 
Harrison said he is hoping to assemble about 20 artists who each will design and produce a piece of the art that will face Highway 75. The overall quilt mural, he said, is to be 32 feet tall and 44 feet wide. 
Mural expenses are to be covered in part by the state award.  Harrison said he is applying for other community grants as well.
The funding source for the broader North-South recovery grant program started with deadline-strapped COVID-19 federal dollars, but a swap with state dollars later occurred to allow more time for a complex slate of projects to develop. Sharing the $235 million are about 130 groups and businesses, whose selection by state officials were based on potential for helping to reverse disinvestment.
When Midwest Businesses & Projects tapped Harrison, he was told to consider the diversity of residents in the area. Harrison said he had been intrigued with a quilt design he’d seen in a different city, and thought that the “unity” concept fit well in this case.
Lodoño Mejía said job creation and international flavor are common denominators of the three projects that share the state award. 
“On the housing, we wanted a mural to show the importance of working together, the many people from South Omaha that contribute,” she said.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A new Montana law requiring a voter’s birth year has led to county election officials rejecting an abnormal number of ballots for this year’s local elections.
Ballots sent to Montana voters this election year look a little different than in years past. Underneath the ballot envelope’s signature line are four rectangles, with instructions to fill in a voter’s birth year.
The change comes from a law passed by the 2025 legislature that was intended to increase voter security by adding another layer of verification to absentee ballots.
In one county that had a practice run with the requirement, voters have adjusted, although a county official said the federal election next year will require significant outreach.
However, the law also gives voters an additional chance to make a mistake, and some counties are seeing rejection rates soar as a result. 
“This was our concern at the Legislature, that this law could cause otherwise valid ballots to be rejected, and unfortunately we’re just seeing it come to fruition,” Missoula County election administrator Bradley Seaman told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “We’ve got about a 4% rate of rejected ballots, up from just fractions of a percent we normally see. We have a very high rejection rate this year, and the main reason is people are missing the dates.”
Seaman said that as of Wednesday, with another week and a half to go before Election Day, his office in Missoula had rejected 467 ballots — 357 of them due to a missing or incorrect birth year. 
By comparison, in Missoula county’s 2023 municipal election, only 142 total ballots were rejected due to a missing or mismatched signature, out of nearly 25,000.
“It’s critical that every vote matters,” Seaman said, pointing to the previous city council election where one race ended in an exact tie. 
If a ballot is rejected, a county elections office will send a letter to the voter’s address, and if possible, send an email or call them. Once notified, voters are able to resolve issues with their ballot until 5 p.m. the day after the election, either in person, or by mail or email, by following the directions sent by election officials. 
Montana voters can check the status of their ballots by going to myvoterpage.com, which Seaman recommends everyone do, regardless of how sure they are that their ballot was correctly filled out.

While Missoula County is seeing a higher than normal rejection rate, not all counties are in the same boat. 
In Lewis and Clark County, the elections department, and voters, benefitted from having a “soft launch” of the birth year requirement during a school bond and city of Helena primary election in September, and widespread voter outreach. 
Connor Fitzpatrick, the county’s elections supervisor, said voters in the September election were instructed to put their birth year on their ballot envelope, even though the law didn’t take effect until Oct. 1. Missing dates, in that case, didn’t mean ballots would be rejected, but it gave voters the opportunity to practice. 
In addition, the week prior to mailing out ballots, the department sent a mailer to every address involved in the election “as a reminder for city of Helena folk, and to bring it to the attention of anyone not in Helena, that this new law is fully implemented and in play this election,” Fitzpatrick said. 
As of Thursday, Fitzpatrick said his department had only rejected 15 ballots, which he attributed to the soft launch and directed outreach by the elections team. 
“Anytime you change the process for voters, even if it’s a minor change, you’re going to want to find a way to tell them about it,” Fitzpatrick said. “And this is more than a minor change.”
“At the end of the day, we want you to vote, that’s why we’re here,” he added. “But we don’t want to have to deal with a lot of folks coming in at the last minute saying ‘goodness gracious, my ballot was rejected because of this new item.’”
Fitzpatrick said that the double-verification requirement added a little bit of time to ballot processing — a few minutes for each batch — but said that since this year is only a local election, it’s a smaller lift for the department to begin with. 
“A few years from now, in the next presidential election, that will be a good question to ask again, and see if we know how much more time this could add,” Fitzpatrick said. 
In Yellowstone County, where the most ballots have been sent out to voters, election officials told the Daily Montanan that of the 9,700 ballots returned as of Wednesday, 5.6% had been rejected — up from 0.8% in 2023. 
“For those who did not complete the requirement, it adds an extra burden to them to have to fix it,” said Dayna Causby, the county’s new election administrator. “And it’s a strain on our office as well. Our office is having to reach out to a much larger number of them than before.”
Flathead County, which is conducting its largest all-mail election ever, said they’re seeing ballots returned at an extremely slow pace. Of the roughly 1,100 received through Wednesday, about 1.5% were rejected. That’s about twice the rate seen during the 2024 election, though the election administrator noted that last year was a presidential election so it’s not a perfect comparison.
Strengthening election integrity
House Bill 719 was carried by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls at the request of the Secretary of State’s office. 
Mitchell couldn’t be reached for comment on Thursday, but said during the Legislature that the law is a “common-sense practice,” that aligns absentee voting with in-person requirements. The bill is aimed at increasing voter confidence, reducing errors and preventing fraud, he said.
Montana has had just two known cases of election fraud since 1997, according to the Heritage Foundation’s election fraud tracker. 
In May, the law was challenged in Lewis and Clark District Court by two organizations, Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana, which allege the law is unnecessary and adds a hurdle to the process that will disenfranchise voters. 
More than 80% of Montanans vote using absentee ballots, all of whom would be subject to the new requirement, the lawsuit states, and have more chances for error. 
“Researchers found that, as the number of ‘verification’ requirements increases, so do ballot rejection rates,” the lawsuit states. According to an MIT study, states that just require a signature verification have an average rejection rate of 0.77%; but having two verification requirements increases the rejection rate 2.5 times. 
“Ultimately, in its effort to fix a non-existent problem, HB 719 creates a problem that is very real: the exclusion of qualified voters,” the suit states. “And while it was vaunted by its proponents as an election integrity measure, HB 719 undermines democracy in Montana by excluding qualified voters from the process.”

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Large scale federal changes to funding, both through the reconciliation bill passed this summer and other actions President Donald Trump’s administration has taken, will have significant impacts on Montana, state agencies reported on Wednesday.
Legislators heard the report from the state’s legislative support divisions, as well as agency staff during an eight-hour meeting on Wednesday in Helena. Food assistance and government-funded healthcare will see changes and the state could see less tax revenue through new rules in that area.
The Legislative Fiscal Divisions report, “Federal Budget Impacts to State,” is 45 pages long and specifically gets into what federal grants have changed. A report this summer estimated a nearly $160 million hit to the state’s budget.
About 44.5% of the House Bill 2 budget comes from the federal government, the report states. That bill included certain “triggers” that would bring the finance committee together with interim committees and interim budget committees.
“We’ve well established that those triggers have happened in (the federal reconciliation bill),” Amy Carlson, with Legislative Fiscal, told legislators on Wednesday.”… I think that we as a state are going to be having this conversation about how the federal government changes in funding affect Montana’s budget, and how you all feel about that, and what changes you may or may not want to do as a result of that.”
Marcia Howard, the executive director of Federal Funds Information for States, also gave the legislators an overview of federal changes. Her organization helps states analyze the impact of federal changes on their budget. 
She said the president’s administration has made it clear where their priorities lie.
“To cut taxes, to cut mandatory programs, to cut discretionary grants, to shrink the federal footprint generally, to make the federal government smaller and to vastly expand executive branch power,” Howard said. “And there are a lot of tools available to do these things, and the administration has used all of them to some degree.”
She said those changes have not been as “transparent” as they would be “in a normal year.” Howard added that many grant programs have been restructured, and that timelines have been shortened if they get reopened. Some actions the Trump administration has taken to stop grant programs may or may not be legal, she added.
“It may be that by the time all of this runs its course, the clock has just run out, that it becomes irrelevant whether it was legal or illegal, because it was two or three or four years ago, and the funds just never made their way to the recipients,” Howard said.
Susie Hedalen, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, said federal funds only make up 13.7% of a school district’s budget in the state and told legislators they “were not too worried” about potential federal education cuts. The federal Department of Education has been marked for shutdown by the Trump administration.
There was also concern funding could dip for the Montana State Library, the Montana Arts Council and the Montana Historical Society. They have small budgets to begin with and federal money makes up a huge percentage of their funding, representatives for those organizations noted.
Legislators and the presenters discussed what they could do to cover food assistance programs during the federal shutdown. House Bill 924, asking the Governor’s Office to use certain funds or even taking a loan against another pot of state money were all discussed as potential pathways for food assistance funding.
“The Legislative Fiscal Division memo today shows an estimated biennial revenue loss from the individual income tax provisions of around 230 million each biennium,” Rose Bender, with the Montana Budget and Policy Center, said during a public comment. “Moving forward, we think there is additional risk of revenue loss within this budget window from changes not listed in that memo, and on top of that, lost tax revenue, these tax cuts come while our state is being required to cover additional pieces of the SNAP and Medicaid programs.”
New rules on Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Programs ask states to contribute more and ties what’s called an “error rate” to that money. Montana’s error rate, which includes both overallotting and underallotting money for food, is between  7% and 8%, the report noted.
“There are less federal dollars coming in for SNAP administration, more state funds required as we move forward in SNAP, there is that state responsibility tied to the error rate in SNAP, right,” said Josh Platt, with Legislative Fiscal. “And so that work has already started at the agency level to work on getting that error rate down.”
Other changes discussed included coal and oil leases — new rules will have companies paying less, so less tax revenue — and transportation funding.
Two large state transportation projects, Nine Pipes along Highway 93 and another in East Missoula, were impacted in the cuts. Department of Transportation head Chris Dorrington said Nine Pipes would likely be reduced in scale and that he “didn’t see” the East Missoula project coming back.
The justice system is also seeing cuts, Walker Hopkins, with Legislative Fiscal, added.
“What we’ve been able to identify so far is areas that would be hit in terms of federal funding is our assistance and services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence and sexual assault,” Hopkins said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HB-2-Folder-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:57:35.450220

Of the 1,625 claims the state Employment Security Department had received by Tuesday, 411 had been paid. The rest were pending. 
The state’s goal is no more than 21 days from getting an unemployment insurance application to the applicant receiving benefits. 
“Our No. 1 goal is to get people paid as quickly as possible,” Employment Security Commissioner Cami Feek said. “We understand the stress involved in being furloughed or laid off.”
The agency is receiving dozens more claims each day. This tracks with what the state saw during the last shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019. The current shutdown was in its 23rd day on Thursday and is now the second-longest in U.S. history.
King, Pierce, Kitsap and Thurston counties are home to the most federal employees filing claims. An Employment Security Department spokesperson said information about which federal agencies employed the laid-off workers is confidential. But the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security and Transportation, along with the Postal Service, are among the agencies with the most workers in Washington. 
As of the first quarter of this year, Washington had nearly 80,000 federal workers in total.
Nearly 500 people attended an Employment Security Department webinar Thursday focused on helping federal workers and others affected by the government shutdown. 
Congress has shown no signs of coming close to a compromise to reopen the government as they disagree on the future of health care subsidies.
Once the shutdown ends, federal workers are meant to receive back pay under a 2019 law, but the Trump administration has signaled it wouldn’t compensate employees for their forced time off. If they do receive that back pay, they’d have to repay unemployment benefits to the state.
President Donald Trump has also tried to fire thousands of federal workers during the shutdown, but a judge has halted that move.
Federal workers who are continuing to work without compensation aren’t eligible for unemployment, a change from the previous prolonged shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019. 
Senators on Thursday failed to pass either Republican- or Democratic-backed proposals to pay federal employees and contractors who continue to work despite the shutdown, meaning they won’t be paid until the government is reopened.
Most federal employees will miss their first full paycheck either Friday or early next week. 
The state Department of Financial Institutions has compiled a list of resources for federal workers during the shutdown. And there will be another webinar to answer questions Oct. 30.

Meanwhile, Washington state employees who work on the food stamp program could see layoffs if the shutdown continues into November. Benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are set to run out if the shutdown stretches into November.
The Department of Social and Health Services is “looking at ways to address” the funding issue to minimize the impact to state workers and food stamp enrollees, said spokesperson Norah West.

(Jeniffer Solis / Nevada Current)Two New Mexico Congressional delegation members on Thursday helped lead a letter with other Democratic lawmakers demanding the federal government reverse its decision to furlough federal workers overseeing nuclear weapons work and stockpile.
On Monday, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright confirmed 1,400 employees across the nation had been furloughed as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1.
As Source reported on Wednesday, those employees included  152 National Nuclear Security Agency workers in New Mexico, leaving only 14 employees split between the NNSA’s Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories locations. The furloughs are the agency’s first since its creation in 2000, and none occurred during previous shutdowns.

Democratic U.S. Reps. Melanie Stansbury and Teresa Leger Fernández, representing the 1st and 3rd congressional districts respectively, signed an Oct. 23 letter, along with Reps. Eric Swalwell from California, Dina Titus from Nevada and more than 20 other members of Congress.
The letter, addressed to Wright and NNSA Administrator Brandon Williams, asks for an explanation of why more NNSA employees were not kept on as essential workers, “given the gravity of their duties” in overseeing the nuclear weapons stockpile and nonproliferation work overseas.
“Furloughing the vast majority of the agency’s personnel is not only an unprecedented step, it is deeply harmful to U.S. national security,” the letter states. “Undermining the agency’s workforce at such a challenging time for U.S. global leadership diminishes our credible deterrence, emboldens our international adversaries, and makes the world a more dangerous place.”
Other questions the letter asks to be answered by Nov. 7 include the administration’s legal basis for furloughing NNSA staff, along with an accounting for the total numbers of staff furloughed and remaining on duty.
“Congress has a right to know exactly how much more dangerous our lives are now that you have sent the vast majority of NNSA’s staff home,” the letter states.
The letter, which notes the unprecedented nature of the NNSA furloughs, concludes with a request that the agency reverse its decision.
“We urgently demand that you rescind this furlough notice and return NNSA employees to the important job of ensuring our nuclear stockpile is safe, secure, and reliable.”

Ned Lamont are aligned on most portions of a new housing bill, written to replace the vetoed House Bill 5002. But a handful of the most substantial pieces of the measure are still up for debate.
State legislative leaders say they won’t bring a weak bill to the floor during a special session of the General Assembly planned for next month.
At the state Department of Housing’s annual conference at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket on Thursday, top state officials said negotiations are almost wrapped up.
“I think we’re still talking. I think we’re pretty close,” Lamont said.
The new bill seeks to replace H.B. 5002, the most significant piece of housing legislation to come across the governor’s desk during his years in office, which tackled homelessness, zoning and parking, among other topics. Lawmakers narrowly passed the measure in the waning days of this year’s legislative session. The governor then surprised many Democrats when he vetoed the measure in June.
The veto caused anger and disappointment among many Democrats who said Lamont’s staff had worked on the bill with them, and they’d been assured he would sign it.
Lamont issued the veto under pressure from outside groups and town officials. Opponents feared the bill would dilute local control and put unrealistic expectations on towns for building more housing.
On Thursday, Lamont gave some of the clearest details released so far on the new version of the bill — including changes to a parking reform measure, more regional resources, and state aid to build sewer and water systems.
Lamont said after Thursday’s event that he was still discussing some of the same measures he’d taken issue with when he vetoed the bill — parking reform and a requirement for towns to plan and zone for a set number of units known as fair share. Those were among the most controversial measures in the bill.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he wants to find a solution — and he also wants to see housing built more quickly. 
“I hope we can get there, but we will not bring a weak bill to the floor of the Senate,” Duff said.

House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he thinks lawmakers and the governor agree on about 85% of the bill, but the 15% they don’t agree on is substantive.
“Knowing that we were talking about 15% of the bill … maybe 13%? I’m not just saying that for the sake of saying that, I truly believe that,” Rojas said. “A bill ain’t dead until it’s dead, and it ain’t dead yet.”
Rojas said he’s optimistic that officials will have a housing bill ready for the Nov. 12 and 13 special session. Lawmakers also plan to debate a financial plan to respond to federal human services cuts at the session.
Lamont said he agreed there was little of the bill left to negotiate but “the final two yards is always the toughest.”
“I want to do everything I can to make it easier and faster for developers to build. I want towns to take the lead,” he said.
He said the new bill aims to have towns select areas to “pre-zone” for more housing, such as locations close to public transit — a description similar to elements of the portion of the old bill known as Work, Live Ride.
He said the state will provide regional councils of government with planners who have “the skills they need to work with the towns” and to work “as a region.” He said towns will be able to work collectively on housing, sewer and water resources under the approach. The state will help with the projects, and for towns that build more housing and need to expand their schools, Lamont said the state will be ready to help.
According to Lamont, town officials have said they’re OK with allowing the conversion of commercial properties to residential without a special hearing in certain districts and — as long as the first floor can remain commercial so residents can access restaurants and shops. The previous proposal had allowed those conversions as of right without the qualification regarding the first floor.
H.B. 5002 had also removed mandates for developers to build off-street parking for residential buildings with up to 24 units. Lamont said under the new bill, that number will likely be lowered to 16 units.
“The parking requirements are overdone, and that’s one of the things we’re looking at with this bill,” Lamont said. “Maybe 16 units, you don’t have to have additional parking, but we’ll give the towns a little bit of flexibility if there’s a particular need.”
Rojas and Duff weren’t as specific.
“I think the big picture of the bill is: How do we get more bang for our buck? How do we reduce regulations and all the other obstacles and needle points that exist in our housing development process?” Rojas said. He said the legislature had done its job during the session and passed a good bill.

“This is an issue that literally impacts everybody across the state of Connecticut,” Duff said. “And while you have people in communities who don’t want growth and don’t want housing, it’s really important for us to say ‘But there are actually more people who want growth and who want housing, who can’t afford a place to live.’”
Rojas has often characterized other housing bills as painfully incremental. Both lawmakers said they want to see bigger moves.
“Incremental legislation is not putting shovels in the ground, and that’s why we have to go forward faster,” Duff said.
Lamont and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz praised a few towns such as West Hartford that have taken steps to build more affordable housing. 
They also pushed back against ideas that have spread widely among some who opposed H.B. 5002 — that more affordable housing in towns is a problem for current residents.
“I love Mayor Shari Cantor, and people come up to her a little grumpy sometimes, and go ‘I like West Hartford just the way it is.’ She goes, ‘I know. You’re going to love it the way it will be,’” Lamont said. “That’s what we’re trying to think about in this state.”
“I think there’s a myth out there that if your town has affordable housing in it, that somehow that affordable housing makes that town or city undesirable, and the exact opposite is true,” Bysiewicz said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1023_SR_HousingConvention_162-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:01:39.950344
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-23 22:56:49+00:00,CT Mirror,CSCU will not raise tuition next year. But food service will cost more,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/23/cscu-freeze-tuition-housing-food/,The CSCU Board of Regents voted Thursday to keep tuition and housing fees flat for the second year in a row.,"The Board of Regents for Connecticut State Colleges and Universities — which includes four regional universities, the community colleges and the online Charter Oak State College — voted Thursday to keep tuition fees flat for the second year in a row but to raise food service costs and certain programmatic fees.
Average annual tuition at the state universities is about $7,000 for a full-time student. Tuition at the community colleges is about $5,200 for full-time, in-state students. The regents voted unanimously to keep those rates steady in the coming school year. Housing fees will also remain flat this year.
Food service fees will increase by about $200 at Central Connecticut State University and Eastern Connecticut State University, by about $270 at Southern Connecticut State University and by $300 at Western Connecticut State University. And several specialized programs will incur additional fees between $100 and $300 annually.
“We are not proposing increases in tuition for academic year 26-27. Nor are we proposing any changes in the mandatory fees. However, we do face increased costs. And so the institutions are proposing a select few number of fees that they’d like to see increased to cover those increased costs,” said CSCU Chief Financial Officer Lloyd Blanchard. 
The move comes as public colleges and universities elsewhere the country have been raising tuition to offset declining revenues, slowing state investments and anticipated federal funding cuts. According to The Hechinger Report, tuition at public colleges this fall have risen as much as 10% after a period in which tuition increases were generally below the rate of inflation.
Connecticut has bucked that trend. This is the second year in a row that the state Board of Regents has frozen tuition — although housing costs rose last year between 2.75% and 12%. The previous year, tuition increased 5% as the colleges and universities faced the loss of federal COVID emergency funding. 
With tuition frozen at last year’s rates, the CSCU system saw its student population rise. Student enrollment at the four state universities is nearly 10% higher than it was in the fall of 2024. Enrollment at the community colleges is 4.3% higher than at the same time last year. 
Reserve funds
The boost in student enrollment could mean additional revenues for the state colleges and universities. But the system also has reserve funds to help keep things steady.
In March, CT Mirror reported that CSCU was sitting on about $600 million in budget reserves. The system plans to tap into its reserves in order to pay for expected shortfalls next year. So far this year, CSCU officials said they’ve used about $155 million in reserve funds.
“We are not sitting on a treasure trove. We are being strategic and responsible as it relates to our finances,” O. John Maduko, CSCU’s interim chancellor, said at Thursday’s regents’ meeting. “But we need to be cautious and we need to be conservative.” 
The board also voted Thursday to approve several partnerships between local companies and state universities that would allow employees at the companies to receive a 5% discount if they enroll in the local state university. 
Zulma Toro, president of Central CT State, said the university expected to enroll as many as 20 students through a partnership with Hanwha Aerospace. She said the college’s investment, for the 5% tuition discount, would equal about $5,700, and the college would receive about $109,600 in tuition. 
“Even though higher education is not a business, in any business, this could be a nice investment,” said Toro. 
She noted that Hanwha Aerospace had a long-standing partnership with Central, having donated $200,000 for the naming of the campus’ aerospace mechanical engineering lab, and that the company had pledged to put aside spaces for internships for seven Central students. The college is also partnering with Advanced Behavioral Care, which is working with students in the school’s College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. 
The board approved three partnerships at Western CT State — with the Danbury Chamber of Commerce, Newtown Savings Bank and Ives Bank. 
At the Oct. 15 finance committee meeting, Western CT State President Jesse Bernal told the committee that the partnerships were part of the university’s strategy to get out of its $23 million deficit. “These kinds of arrangements are going to be central for us to be able to generate revenue,” said Bernal. 
On Thursday, Ari Santiago, one of the regents, expressed support for the arrangements. “This is an opportunity to get our name out through people in the workforce who are looking to improve their position, gain more education,” Santiago said. “It opens us up to get marketing inside these organizations, and … we can gain additional students down the line.”  
Financial insecurity
Still, many CSCU students struggle to afford necessities. Monthly visits to the college food pantries has grown by 40% over the past year. Recently, grocery chain Stop and Shop donated $200,000 to CSCU’s food pantries. 
According to a survey of students at Central CT State last fall, nearly half said they ate less because they couldn’t afford enough food. About a quarter of the students said they skipped eating at least one day a week because of financial insecurity. 
Looming federal cuts could make things even more challenging. Karen Hynick, acting provost at CT State Community College, told lawmakers in September that about 6,000 students, or about 11% of the student body, were eligible for SNAP benefits — a program that’s at risk of being cut off after this month due to the federal government shutdown. 
And many students will face additional fees for the programs they’re enrolled in.
The Board of Regents also voted Thursday to add fees for specialized programs, including a $300 fee at Central for the college’s doctor of nurse anesthesia practice program and a $125 fee for the bachelors of nursing program.
Blanchard, CSCU’s CFO, said the fees would cover things like virtual reality software and equipment, as well as supplies like needles. 
Additional fees will also apply to several programs at Southern CT State, including a $100 fee for the social work bachelors program, a $300 fee for the social work masters program and $300 for the occupational therapy program. 
Lillian Wanjagi, Southern’s Chief Financial Officer, said at the Oct. 15 meeting that the masters in social work fee was connected to accreditation requirements, and the occupational therapy costs were connected to specialized tools used in the program. 
Southern CT State Interim President Sandra Bulmer said that the cost of social work programs had increased “dramatically” because of the necessary clinical placements.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1109_SR_AllinMilford_158-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-23 19:01:39.950344

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Two days after a U.S. senator from South Dakota said he was encouraged by the desire of President Donald Trump to “do right” by American ranchers, Trump outraged many of them by rolling out a policy to import more beef from Argentina.
A White House official told Reuters on Thursday that the Trump administration will quadruple the amount of beef that can be imported from Argentina at a lower tariff rate. 
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in response to a reporter’s question at a White House briefing Thursday that Trump “loves our ranchers and he also loves American consumers, and he wants to do right by both.”
“So the immediate solution to the problem of the rising cost of beef — the president wants to bring that down — is we have to increase our supply, and so that’s what he’s doing with respect to these imports,” Leavitt said.

The policy announcement came amid a sudden and rapidly escalating feud between Trump and ranchers — many of whom are Trump supporters — after Trump said Sunday that buying more Argentinian beef would “bring our beef prices down.” The average price of ground chuck is up by more than $1 per pound so far this year.
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, issued a statement Tuesday that he’d met with the president and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and came away “encouraged by the desire of President Trump and Secretary Rollins to do right by the American producer.”
Wednesday, as tempers flared against Trump in cattle country, the president posted on social media that “Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” adding “It would be nice if they would understand that.”
Thursday, after the news broke that Trump was following through on his suggestion to import more Argentinian beef, Rounds’ office did not offer a comment and told South Dakota Searchlight he was unavailable for an interview.  
Cattle industry representative calls action ‘ludicrous’
Ranchers and their trade-industry representatives in South Dakota, which has more than 3 million cattle and gave Trump 63% support in the last election, did not hold back.
Craig Bieber, vice president of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, said the messaging from Trump landed hard. 
“This has all been a bit of a gut punch to producers. I mean, I really feel like producers are shocked because we’ve supported him consistently,” Bieber said. “We finally got prices that we can make some headway on, and it just seems ludicrous that President Trump thinks that now that we’re finally at good prices, he needs to do something about it.”
Senator ‘encouraged’ Trump will ‘do right’ amid backlash over Argentinian beef comments

U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, and seven of his House Republican colleagues sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday, urging the administration to ensure that any future trade decisions are made with “full transparency, sound science, and a firm commitment to the U.S. cattle industry.” 
“I understand the president’s efforts to strengthen trade and keep food affordable, but those efforts should not undermine the farmers and ranchers who put dinner on our tables,” Johnson said in a statement at the time. 
Thursday, Johnson’s office sent Searchlight an updated statement: “I’ve been public about my concerns with this plan. The best way to lower prices at the meat counter is through more American beef, not more Argentinian beef.”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said Thursday that he is concerned and wants a say in how the import policy is implemented.
“We’re paying close attention to it, and we’ve been in touch with the White House, Department of Agriculture, U.S. trade rep on all this stuff, trying to figure out where it’s headed,” Thune told reporters, according to Reuters.
‘Suite of actions’ welcomed, but seen as insufficient
In addition to Trump’s social media post Wednesday, the White House announced what it called “a suite of actions to strengthen the American beef industry.” They include boosting access to federal grazing lands, expanding indemnity payments for livestock lost to predators, strengthening “Product of USA” labeling, increasing funding and loans for small meat processors, reducing inspection fees, encouraging schools to buy locally raised beef, and working to open additional export markets.
Rancher and South Dakota state Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, said the proposals will help, but won’t solve all the problems in the cattle industry. 
“You can nibble around the edges, or you can go to the big issue: breaking up the monopoly structure that lets meatpackers dictate markets,” she said. “Restore true market competition.”
USDA announces plan to ‘strengthen’ beef industry

May said it’s simple: “Enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act and dust off the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Act.” The first law is designed to prevent unfair, deceptive and anti-competitive practices in the livestock and meatpacking industries, and the latter is intended to prevent monopolistic practices. 
“Do that and the rest will take care of itself,” she said. 
Amanda Radke, a rancher near Mitchell and co-owner of Radke Cattle Co., made similar observations while saying she is excited about a number of the Trump administration’s “suite of actions” to strengthen the beef industry. 
“We have a packer monopoly where 85% of our beef supply is held captive by four major players, two that are foreign-owned,” she said. “Ranchers don’t want a handout — they just want a free and fair market.”
Packer concentration, as many ranchers describe it, has worsened in recent decades. In 1980, the top four beef packers accounted for about 35% of cattle purchases. 
May, Radke and others in the industry have said greater imports of beef from Argentina are unlikely to push down retail prices.
“The packers will benefit from this, not consumers,” May said.
Parade-area rancher and Democratic former state lawmaker Oren Lesmeister said Trump’s comments on social media show an ignorance of cattle industry economics.


Let us know what you think...


 

Lesmeister said prices are high because cattle numbers have declined due to droughts, ranchers aging out of the business and other factors. The Agriculture Department’s own Wednesday announcement said the national herd is at a 75-year low while consumer demand for beef has grown 9% over the past decade. 
Lesmeister said he hopes ranchers take the moment to reflect and see that it’s Democratic politicians working to break up monopolies, not Trump. 
Lesmeister also said an unpredictable president who seems indifferent to the effects of his words on markets “makes it really tough to operate.” He said beef prices have traditionally been influenced by weather, production and the export market.
“Now, it doesn’t matter. It’s, ‘What’s the president going to say tomorrow?’” Lesmeister said. 
Soybean farmers also angry about Argentina aid
Ranchers aren’t the only members of the agriculture community upset with Trump’s efforts to help Argentina.
Trump has praised Argentina’s Libertarian president, Javier Milei, including at Mar-a-Lago last year and during a White House meeting this month. Trump has also pledged $20 billion worth of aid to bolster the country’s collapsing currency and has discussed increasing the figure to $40 billion. 
Meanwhile, Argentina and the U.S. are rival soybean producers, and Argentina is reportedly increasing its soybean exports to China while that country boycotts U.S. soybean purchases in retaliation for Trump-imposed tariffs.
National Farmers Union President Rob Larew said the Trump administration was already hurting American agricultural producers while helping Argentinians.
“The last thing we need is to reward them by importing more of their beef,” Larew said in a statement.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota couple want an Iowa carbon pipeline company to pay them for surveying their land against their will.
Jared and Tara Bossly, of rural Aberdeen, filed a trespassing lawsuit this week in Brown County against Summit Carbon Solutions and a handful of affiliated companies they say acted as agents of the company.
That Iowa-based company hopes to build a multi-state underground pipeline to collect carbon dioxide from ethanol plants for transport and sequestration. Fierce opposition to the project by some South Dakota landowners helped spur the ballot box repeal of a law seen as too friendly to pipeline companies in 2024 and to the passage of a law barring the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Summit has also been denied a permit by South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission.
Eminent domain is the right to access private property for projects that benefit the public, with compensation determined by a court.
The Bossly family, whose land was included in Summit’s original pipeline path, have been vocal opponents of Summit since 2022. The family was among several to sue Summit in an attempt to block it from using eminent domain to survey land or use it for the pipeline project.
The landowners won at the South Dakota Supreme Court level in August of 2023.
Court ruling complicates carbon pipeline company’s push for land

Two months before that, however, Summit arrived at the Bossly property to survey it. At that point, a circuit court judge had twice issued rulings allowing such surveys to take place, but the landowners had an appeal pending before the state’s high court.
In the Bosslys’ new lawsuit, the family says Summit’s actions on the day of the survey amounted to trespass because the company knew of the pending appeal.
The lawsuit says Jared Bossly was a “prisoner on his own land” as the surveying took place in June of 2023, because private security guards and sheriff’s deputies prevented him from being within 300 feet of the surveyors.
“I would never want anyone else to feel that way on their own land,” Bossly said in a press release on the lawsuit. “We are bringing this case in hopes a Brown County jury will do justice by finding Summit and the other defendants liable for what they did.”
The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for the June 2023 surveying, for what the case says was permanent property damage from drilling and surveying. The Bosslys are alleging the company trespassed, acted as a nuisance, and was negligent in training its employees.
The Bosslys are also seeking damages based on a visit to the Bossly farm in May of 2023, a day on which they say company representatives unlawfully entered an outbuilding while Jared Bossly was away and frightened his wife Tara Bossly by hollering into their house while she was inside taking a shower. 
A representative from Summit said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
Ed Fischbach, another vocal pipeline opponent who lives near the Bosslys, arrived at the Bossly farm before Jared on the day of the June survey. He said he hopes the case will “send the message that what Summit has done is wrong.”

Efforts to reconfigure the state’s legislative districts to adhere to county lines came to a halt Wednesday. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers hit pause on redrawing voting maps appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming lawmakers are pumping the brakes on efforts to redraw the state’s legislative district maps to match county lines. 
The Joint Reapportionment Subcommittee met virtually Wednesday to hear public comment and to discuss several proposals Weston County voters presented to lawmakers last month in Newcastle. 
Since 2022, when Wyoming redrew its legislative districts following the last census, some Weston County voters have argued they’re inadequately represented in the statehouse because their lawmakers also represent varying portions of surrounding counties. 
The subcommittee, however, chose not to recommend any of the proposals to the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee for sponsorship in the 2026 budget session. Instead, the subcommittee chose to draft and forward a report to lawmakers to consider down the line. 
“We’re coming in on a recommendation here that the present system seems satisfactory for now, but we’re willing to put in more effort to keep looking,” Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said at the virtual meeting. 
For decades, Wyoming’s legislative districts adhered to county lines, as specified in the state’s constitution. However, that legal requirement was upended in 1991 when a federal court ruled that Wyoming’s legislative maps violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution — also known as “one person, one vote.” 
Since then, the Legislature has shifted away from strict adherence to county boundaries and toward population. As a result, Weston County — one of the state’s least populated counties — is represented in the House and Senate by lawmakers who also speak for voters in certain parts of Campbell, Crook, Goshen and Niobrara. 
“It’s got to be a hard job for a senator to represent more than one community of interest in Wyoming at the same time, equally on all things,” Newcastle resident William Curley told the subcommittee in September. 
At that meeting, public testimony was nearly unanimous in its support for county conformity, though support varied on how exactly to achieve that. One proposal would involve weighted votes, while another would dramatically expand the number of lawmakers.

“Our ruralness is what, many times, makes us, I would say, makes us Wyoming,” Neiman said. 
Over the course of three terms in the Legislature, Neiman has ascended to Speaker of the House, the most powerful position in the lower chamber. Still, he and his constituents argue that “rural voices” are diminishing in Cheyenne. 
Wednesday meeting
The meeting this week offered a different perspective. 
“I am the Gorin of Gorin v Karpan,” Laramie resident Sarah Gorin told the committee. “I was unable to attend your first meeting, and so I asked to testify today just briefly to fill you in on some of the background of that case and to speak for the basic fairness of the principle of one person, one vote.”
In 1991, Gorin was lead plaintiff in the case that would ultimately result in a U.S. District Court directing the Legislature to disregard the provision in the Wyoming Constitution that required each county to constitute a senatorial and representative district.
“While there can be little doubt that many Wyoming counties possess a sense of identity, a sense of neighborhood, and a sense of community interests, the bottom line is that citizens and not governmental units or regional interests are entitled to elect lawmakers,” according to a section of the ruling Gorin read to the committee. 
The ruling has held up, including in a 2012 legal challenge, according to a Legislative Service Office memo. In that case, the court ruled that the plaintiffs presented no evidence that county-based districts resulted in different electoral rights compared to those drawn based on population.  
Gorin told the committee that lawmakers are treading into similar territory. 
“We haven’t yet heard a description of a problem that is so big that we need to turn the entire legislative system on its head and embark on something that is almost guaranteed to engender litigation,” Gorin said. 
A New Jersey resident, who provided virtual testimony, was the one person at Wednesday’s meeting to urge Wyoming lawmakers forward.
“I know many of you might be thinking, ‘What brings a 26-year-old New Jerseyian all the way to Wyoming to testify about apportionment?’ The answer is the same reason I testified in my home state, which was to ensure that our state constitutions are followed as faithfully as possible,” Todd Lund Jr. told the committee. 
Lund works as a policy director for Paul Kanitra, a Republican New Jersey Assemblyman, according to his LinkedIn.  
While the panel did not proceed with legislation, the door’s not entirely closed on redrawing the state’s legislative lines. Individual lawmakers could bring their own bills, though such knotty legislation is likely to face significant challenges during a budget session when time is limited and bills face a steeper, initial hurdle. 
The 2026 session starts Feb. 9.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An 18-year-old Des Moines Public Schools student was detained and deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to an immigrant rights group.
The student, whose name was not released, had attended a routine immigration check-in at the Federal Building in Des Moines on Sept. 30, according to advocates with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, and was detained by ICE officials at the building briefly before being taken to the Hardin County Jail in Eldora.
After being transferred to the Iowa jail, the student was later sent to a detention center in Louisiana before being deported to a Central American country, according to the advocacy group. Iowa MMJ did not respond to further questions about the student’s immigration status or background; though the Des Moines Register reported his guardian was not able to speak with him for four days following his detainment, and then did not hear from him until Oct. 12, when he had been deported.
DMPS officials said in a statement shared with media that the school district was “aware that one of our high school students was detained by federal immigration authorities late last month.”
“This situation did not occur on or near school property,” The statement said. “We understand that news like this can cause concern among our students, families, and staff. Our schools are committed to being safe, welcoming places for every student with principals, teachers and staff who care about their well-being.”
The news of the DMPS student’s deportation comes after the school district has faced the high-profile arrest of former superintendent Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana who was also arrested and detained by ICE officials in late September. Since his arrest, information has been released through reporting and federal authorities showing Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, and faced previous criminal charges.
The Des Moines school board is suing the consulting firm JG Consulting contracted for the search that led to Roberts’ hire. Additionally, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand has said his office has received requests to reaudit DMPS, as well as audit the Iowa Department of Education and state Board of Educational Examiners which granted Roberts’ an administrative license in 2023, in relation to the situation.
There have been several other ICE arrests in Iowa in recent weeks. According to reporting from the New York Times, immigration arrests have increased by 276% in Iowa since President Donald Trump has taken office compared with rates in 2024.
Another immigrant rights group, Escucha Mi Voz, held demonstrations in Davenport Monday in Iowa City calling for workers’ protections against ICE raids, and in Davenport protesting the detainment of Jorge González, a worker at the Bread Garden Market in Iowa City who was detained by ICE agents Sept. 25.
“We will not stand by while ICE unlawfully targets our communities,” Escucha Mi Voz Iowa member Eva Castro, González’s mother-in-law, said in a statement. “Jorge complied with every condition of the asylum process and Alternatives to Detention program. We are going to court to make sure he walks free.”

With the Legislature set to consider statewide school redistricting efforts this coming session, some school boards and supervisory unions are pushing to set their own course.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A southern Vermont school district will weigh whether to close two elementary schools.","Danby, Mt. Tabor and Sunderland residents could soon see their community elementary schools shutter. On Tuesday, residents of the three towns will vote in a non-binding referendum over whether to close the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools.
The Taconic and Green School District oversees four elementary schools and an elementary-middle school for nine towns including Manchester. Residents will vote by Australian ballot on Oct. 28. The district board will then have the final say on closing the two schools during its Nov. 4 meeting.
The board will need 10 of its 13 members to vote in favor of closure — a rule that was enacted during the 2017 merger and creation of the Taconic and Green School District under Act 46. Taconic and Green school board chair Melanie Virgilio, of Sunderland, said the board will consider the results of the referendum but is not bound by them.

“We’ll vote however the entirety of the board chooses to vote in November, but we’ll be given the results, and we’ll have to consider that,” she said. “It’s a huge consideration for board members.”
The move to consolidate the southern Vermont school district’s facilities comes amid declining enrollment and persistent costs to repair and maintain aging infrastructure at the schools — a common dilemma for school districts across the state.
The Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, which encompasses the Taconic and Green, the Mettawee and Winhall school districts, is also simultaneously developing plans for a regional middle school. Superintendent Randi Lowe said she expects the supervisory union will request voter approval in the spring or summer of 2026 to bid for that work.
“We’re moving to consolidation, just because we don’t need as many schools as we’ve got,” she said. “We want to update our facilities, because, just like everybody in the state, we’re facing really, really aging facilities.”
The supervisory union pays tuition to send its high school-aged students out of the district, many to two nearby private schools, Burr and Burton Academy in Manchester and the Long Trail School in Dorset.
Both the Sunderland School and Currier Memorial School in Danby, which respectively serve grades K-6 and pre-K through 5, currently have fewer than 50 students at each school. The closures are necessary, district officials say, to give all of the kids in the district’s schools equal learning opportunities.
The district’s other schools — the Flood Brook School in Londonderry, the Dorset School and the Manchester Elementary-Middle School — each have 30 to 40 kids per grade, and Virgilio said those schools enjoy more robust programming. Staff at the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools, meanwhile, have a difficult time providing the same resources, which creates an “inequity of opportunity” for students in the smaller schools.
“There’s just so few kids that they’re not really able to build learning communities,” Virgilio said. “That just is inequitable as a district. If there are kids in the district that are having access to this kind of elevated level of programming and then the smaller schools aren’t, that’s not really fair.”
If the school district board votes to approve the closure, both schools would shutter on July 1, 2026. The remaining students at the two schools would transfer to the Dorset Elementary School, while the district would shift all of its seventh and eighth grade students from the Dorset School to the Manchester Elementary-Middle School, Lowe said.

Getting ahead
The move to close the two schools, and the plans to build a regional middle school, represent a microcosm of sorts of the changes currently underway on the state level.
Act 73, the education reform bill signed into law in July, has set Vermont on a course to transform its public education system and rework how the state pays for it. But the first step is to consolidate the state’s 119 school districts and 52 supervisory unions into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
The school redistricting task force is currently working to create no more than three possible map configurations for the Legislature to consider, and will meet again on Monday.
While Act 73 has a ways to go before its full implementation, its effects are already being felt. Future ramifications in the law around class size minimums and other provisions are pushing school districts like Taconic and Green to try and exert control over their future. 
More than a dozen school districts in the last two months have written letters to the state’s redistricting task force to convey their preferences around merging.
In the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, the reorganization efforts serve as a preemptive step to get ahead of the consolidation efforts underway at the state level, its superintendent said.
The state’s push to reform its education system, Lowe said, provides “a greater context that says, ‘Hey, this is the right thing for our community, no matter what.'”
“As far as I’m concerned, we know we spend a lot of money on education,” she said. “We are an operationally inefficient state, and we are an expensive state.”
“If we can stabilize our programming for our students and be as efficient as possible with our budget, then we have an opportunity to really make the best decisions for our community, independent of what the state does or doesn’t do,” Lowe said.

Urging caution
Not everyone appears to be on board with the plans. At one of several recent community forums, residents expressed fears that closure of the schools could have a wider impact on their communities. Without schools, why would young families settle in their town?
But residents also expressed a sense of futility that there was little they could do to influence the process — both at the local level and on the state level, according to reporting from the Bennington Banner.
Sandy Pinsonault, R-Dorset, who represents some of the areas that would be affected by the closures, said she hoped that the Taconic and Green school board would “weigh the opinions and concerns of their stakeholders carefully.”
“I think it’s difficult for most people to wrap their minds around the complete picture and how it will affect their families,” she said in an email.
She specifically pointed to uncertainties and “variables” at the state level. The Legislature will ultimately need to vote to approve a new school district map. Without that, much of the provisions in Act 73 would not move forward.
Pinsonault urged caution, and said the board should follow the results of the public referendum. 
“If support is low, the board should pause and regroup,” she wrote. “If support is high, I would recommend deferring any formal action until after the legislative session and committees complete their work.”
Nonetheless, school district leaders point to the uncertainty around what the Legislature will decide as a reason to move forward.
Act 73 sets parameters around class size minimums, requiring at least 12 students in grades 2 through 5, for example — below the current enrollment at the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools.
District members and community members also fear the district could lose access to their school choice system.
“There’s every reason to believe that when the state reconfigures our boards, that a new board will be forced to close the schools anyway,” Virgilio, the school district chair, said. 
The Taconic and Green board can at least move forward now with some community input, but they can’t guarantee the same with the state’s reconfiguration.
“There is a protectionist methodology to this,” she said. “If we do this now and come together, it hopefully fortifies the boundaries of our district.”

(Photo via Google Earth)State officials have cited an Oskaloosa nursing home where a resident died after the staff couldn’t locate a crash cart, forgot to summon an ambulance and failed to realize the resident had standing orders in place for CPR to be administered.
The Oskaloosa Care Center, a 76-resident nursing home in Mahaska County, has been cited by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing with failing to carry out cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, in accordance with a resident’s wishes, and for workers’ inability to locate the facility’s crash cart, which had a defibrillator on board for restoring a patient’s heartbeat in cases of cardiac arrest.
According to the state agency, these failures placed residents of the home in immediate jeopardy.

State inspectors allege that on the morning of Sept. 8, 2025, a certified nursing assistant and registered nurse entered a male resident’s room and found the man slumped over in his recliner and in distress – gasping, sweating profusely and stating he needed to sit.
According to the inspectors’ reports, one of the workers left the room to obtain equipment to check the man’s vital signs, at which point the man’s eyes rolled back in his head as if he was having a seizure.
The director of nursing arrived in the room and instructed a licensed practical nurse to call an ambulance and verify the resident’s “code status,” which would indicate whether the resident either had a do-not-resuscitate, or DNR, order in place, or wished to have potentially lifesaving measures, such as CPR, administered.
After one worker left the room to check the resident’s code status, a nurse communicated over a two-way radio that the resident had a do-not-resuscitate order in place. The staff then concluded the resident was dead and began to clean and clothe the body for the family’s viewing, according to inspectors.
While one worker began the process of contacting the resident’s family, she noticed in the resident’s chart that the man was listed as “full code” — indicating life-saving procedures were to have been performed. She then reviewed other records and confirmed that information.
According to state inspectors, the staff elected not to perform CPR at that point due to the man’s lack of responsiveness, ashen color, blotchy skin and lack of a pulse.
A certified nursing assistant later told inspectors that shortly after the resident was found in distress, two of her co-workers began looking for the home’s crash cart but could not find it. The aide told inspectors she was able to locate the cart, noting that it was marked with a sign that read “AED,” for automated external defibrillator.
According to the inspectors, the CNA noted that for residents designated “full code,” there was supposed to be a green sticker on the outside of their door — adding that there was such a sticker in this case, but it was located on the roommate’s side of the door, so the staff presumed the resident who died had a DNR order in place.
The director of nursing allegedly told inspectors the resident’s door did not contain the correct sticker due to a recent room change, adding that she would have started CPR had she known the man was “full code” but believed she could trust the information given to her by the nurse.
It was later determined that no one had ever called the ambulance and, according to inspectors, the worker who was tasked with that responsibility explained she “forgot to call” while searching for the crash cart.
As a result of the incident, the inspections department proposed, but then held in a suspension, a $10,000 fine. The state fine is being held in suspension so that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services can determine whether a federal penalty should be imposed in its place.
Fine proposed for separate incident
The inspections department also proposed, and held in suspension, a fine for a separate incident involving the staff’s failure to adequately respond to a lethargic female resident’s complaints of chest pain. The resident was later taken to a hospital where it was determined she had suffered a heart attack.
Workers at the home allegedly told inspectors they had reported the resident’s worsening condition to a nurse. The nurse, they said, “dismissed” their concerns, “acted like it was no big deal,” and then asserted the resident was merely “playing possum.”
According to inspectors, when they later interviewed the nurse and asked whether she thought she should have notified the woman’s physician of the situation, the nurse refused to answer.
State records provide conflicting information as the size of the suspended fine stemming from that incident, with some of the records stating $9,000 and some stating $9,500.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — In shadows of the massive Holcomb coal-fired power plant in southwest Kansas, researchers with the Kansas Geological Survey installed solar panels to test a theory about generating electricity on underused corners of center-pivot irrigated crop fields.
The experiment would blend interests of corn, sorghum and soybean farmers and address goals of renewable energy enthusiasts. The idea would be to supplement irrigated crops while producing solar energy on adjacent ground and collecting moisture with gutters affixed to solar panels so water could be directed to the underground aquifer.
“What we hypothesize is that these systems could enhance groundwater recharge, generate substantial amounts of energy, reduce the climate footprint of agriculture while simultaneously providing economic benefits to the farm without displacing any production agriculture,” said Sam Zipper, assistant scientist at KGS and a geologist at KU.
He estimated adding solar panels to corners of 110 center-pivot fields could match production of electricity at the Holcomb plant.
The project was part of an $880,000 grant from the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research’s program known as Seeding Solutions. It involves KU, Kansas State University, Michigan State University and Wheatland Electric Cooperative.
Zipper shared the integrated vision Thursday at the 2025 Kansas Economic Policy Conference at KU, “Ripple Effect: Water and the Kansas Economy.”
Other researchers delved into research on minimizing algae blooms tainting Kansas reservoirs that are key to supplying the state with drinking water and on development of plans for delivery of quality water in quantities necessary for the state’s well-being.
Donna Ginther, director of the KU Institute for Policy and Social Research, delivered a primer on the Kansas agriculture economy and its reliance on water access. Cattle prices, given a national beef shortage, continued to rise at the same time market prices of wheat, corn and sorghum tumbled.
In the past three years, she said, the price of sorghum fell 61%, the value of wheat declined 53% and the price paid for corn slumped 44%. China, traditionally a key destination for U.S. soybeans, has refused to purchase any in wake of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Many countries responded with tariffs of their own.
“A lot of this is retaliatory tariffs,” Ginther said. “If there are retaliatory tariffs, and there’s not international demand for Kansas products, those markets don’t necessarily come back. Sorting out the tariff situation is going to be really important to the ag economy going forward.”

Water policy development
Susan Metzger, director of the Kansas Water Institute at Kansas State, said water was a public good that warranted public investment.
“Water is the backbone to the rural Kansas economy. It’s in all of our best interests, no matter where we live in the state, that we invest in securing the future of that water supply,” Metzger said.
She said leadership of Kansas water policy was shared among the Kansas Water Office, Kansas Water Authority, Kansas Department of Agriculture, Kansas Department of Health and Environment, as well as the Kansas Legislature and governor. The Legislature approved a two-year study of water issues, with the final report due in January 2027.
“With the organization we have, it makes it really hard to find your elbow room if you have a new idea,” Metzger said. “It’s really confusing to figure out whose space is whose, but nobody has really figured out the best reorganization strategy that would make it more efficient.”
Paul Johnson, a farmer serving as policy analyst for the Kansas Rural Center, said the conference ought to be used as a catalyst for a comprehensive debate about the state’s water resources. He said Kansas’ local, state and federal officials had to recognize the result of federal Farm Bill policy delivering $1.3 billion annually in payments to farmers. Those payments incentivize wheat, corn, sorghum and soybeans, he said.
He said about 5,300 farmers in Kansas were responsible for irrigating 2.3 million acres of crops and consuming an estimated two-thirds of the state’s water. In addition, he said, commitment to these crops led to farming practices that washed away topsoil that eventually became sediment in reservoirs central to Kansas’ water supply.
“The Farm Bill drives cropping patterns in Kansas,” Johnson said. “We have to have a meaningful debate.”
He said Kansas policymakers had to accept that too many water rights were issued to landowners from the 1940s to 1980s. Excessive deployment of water rights fueled withdrawal of too much water from the Ogallala Aquifer, which has been in decline for decades. It could be time for the state to determine whether water rights were legally a property right and if the state was willing to buy back a portion of water rights, he said.
Katie Durham, manager of Western Kansas Groundwater Management District No. 1, said compelling top-down changes to use of water by Kansas agriculture could backfire.
“The producers want it to be a local solution,” she said. “The producers want it to be something they come up with.”
 
Urban water priorities
Hays city manager Toby Dougherty, who presides over the only major city in Kansas without an adequate local source of water, said the Legislature ought to come to the aid of Hays. In 1995, Hays bought a 7,000-acre parcel about 70 miles south of the city that included 8,000 acre feet of water rights. The city of Russell, which has also been susceptible to drought, bought an 18% stake in that property.
In 2014, Dougherty was authorized by the two city governments to begin the regulatory process of converting those water rights to municipal use. That triggered an 11-year legal and regulatory conflict tied to the Kansas Water Transfer Act, which outlined the oversight process for transfer of more than 2,000 acre feet of water rights a distance greater than 35 miles.
He said the Legislature ought to repeal the statute because it improperly interfered in Hays and Russell securing a reliable water supply.
“If you have time, Google ‘pipeline map of Kansas’ and look at the amount of oil and gas pipelines we have across Kansas moving commodities,” he said. “Look at a train as it goes by next time. Look at all the grain cars on that train. When you see trucks going down the road, look at the cattle and the beef in those trucks. Yet somehow, when two cities, who are trying to provide water for the future, want to move that water more than 35 miles, we are kind of treated as a foreign actor.”
Gary Janzen, director of public works and utilities in Wichita, said more research should be conducted in purification systems that result in water safe for human consumption.
“Our goal is to lead the way on developing state regulations,” he said. “Right now, Kansas doesn’t have anything in place. It’s a big lift. It’s a big ask, we recognize that. But from a policy perspective we’re hoping to have that in place soon as we can. It’s not for everybody. It’s expensive. There’s a lot of issues of public outreach. Those regulations need to be in place before any of that happens.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Paul-Johnson-Katie-Durham-Susan-Metzger-water-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:01:39.950344

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) As federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is days away from running out, food banks, pantries and charitable groups across Iowa are bracing for what they anticipate will be “unprecedented” need. 
SNAP serves around than 270,000 Iowans each month and is a federally supported program. But as politicians in Washington, D.C., squabble over budget decisions that determine when the government will reopen, food banks across the state have been asked to support hungry Iowans when current federal funding ends on Nov. 1.
Despite the daunting task ahead, food bank officials have said they are determined to continue their mission to keep folks fed. That mission, they said, can be supported by everyday Iowans via donations of time, funds, nonperishable goods and advocacy to members of Congress. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“There is literally no precedent for this,” said Kathy Underhill, the CEO of Des Moines Area Religious Council, or DMARC. “I wish that there was, because that would make it a lot easier for us to predict what we think is going to happen next … In the history of the SNAP program, benefits have never been delayed or not issued, ever.” 
The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services said earlier this month the federal Food and Nutrition Services department instructed states not to issue November SNAP benefits. HHS, in the same news release, said it informed food banks and community organizations to “prepare to provide additional support to impacted Iowans.”
Food banks across the state said they hope the shutdown will end before benefits run out, but will work to keep Iowans fed. That mission, they said, will require creativity and additional support from every community.
Aron Brecht, the community food systems manager with Hawkeye Area Community Action Program, or HACAP, a food bank serving eastern Iowa, said there is no “wrong way” for Iowans to help the sector.
“If you have not given time, or given money, or given food and have always been interested, please allow this to be a scenario where you do that,” Brecht said. “Food banks who provide food to food pantries and meal sites — anybody that’s opening up to help their community right now — we’re all going to need some more help.”
The stakes 
The charitable sector, according to Feeding America, is able to provide one meal to every nine meals provided by SNAP dollars. 
“I want to be really clear that nonprofits cannot replace SNAP benefits,” Underhill with DMARC, said Thursday at a press conference. 
In Polk County alone, where DMARC serves, 50,000 residents receive SNAP benefits. According to DMARC, about half of those recipients are children and seniors. 
While food bank and pantry leaders each said the situation was “unprecedented” they also said they plan to do everything they can to meet the need in their communities. 
“Regardless of what the future holds we will be here, and we’ll be prepared to help meet the need,” Underhill said. “… if you’re one of our neighbors who is losing sleep about how you and your household will be able to get by, please know that there’s a network here to help you.”


Food security vocabulary: 
Food bank: is a broader coalition that transports large quantities of food within a given region. There are six main food banks serving Iowa.
Food pantry: the drive-by windows, charitable closets,  free grocery store setups and the like that serve individuals experiencing hunger. 
SNAP eligibility: The gross income limit for SNAP eligibility in Iowa is 160% of the federal poverty level, which is $25,040 for a single individual or $51,440 for a family of four.


In addition to stocking food pantries, food banks are often involved in after school and weekend feeding programs that help keep children fed when schools are closed.
Barb Prather, executive director for Northeast Iowa Food Bank, said these programs, along with mobile food pantries, are some of the most important programs her food bank does to serve rural communities. 
The word “unprecedented” was used consistently to describe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Prather said the current situation feels “worse to some degree” because during the pandemic there were additional resources available for food banks to tap into. 
“Food banks can’t make up the difference in SNAP or WIC or any of those government programs, but we at the Northeast Iowa Food Bank have a commitment to feed people, and we’ll do everything in our power to be able to hopefully meet that commitment and encourage communities to rise up and help us in doing that,” Prather said. 
Stephanie Sullivan, the assistant director of communications and marketing for Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves western Iowa and eastern Nebraska, said the impact of the shutdown will have “ripple” effects for thousands of people in her region, for months to come.
“We know that our neighbors are already making unthinkable decisions whether they choose between going to the grocery store or paying their medical bills and no one should be forced into that decision,” Sullivan said. 
Beyond the food security sector, SNAP has an economic multiplier factor of up to 1.5, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Under that multiplier, the estimated $45 million in SNAP dollars spent in Iowa each month generates nearly $70 million in economic activity. 
The timing of the shutdown also follows historic cuts to the SNAP program from the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, which a nonpartisan government analysis estimates will cut 20% of funding to the program through 2034. 
It’s estimated the cuts will result in a loss of $50 million in funding for the program in Iowa for 2026, with greater losses in subsequent years. 


Women, Infants and Children program 
While the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, program was originally slated to run out of funds early into the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized $300 million into the program to keep it operational through the end of October.


Sullivan said the cuts to SNAP while her food bank faces historic need makes it feel like the food bank is “climbing an uphill battle” to deploy its mission. 
“Because we haven’t seen a need this high in our history, on top of all the other challenges we’re facing, this is a hunger epidemic, what we’re facing right now,” Sullivan said.
Three ways to help 
Underhill with DMARC, which is the largest food pantry in Des Moines, said the pantry is increasing its food on hand by about 25% and remaining in contact with partners across the metro to “ensure that there are no interruptions in daily service.” 
According to Underhill, the pantry has no intentions to limit the amount of food it guarantees to visitors, nor to alter its services. 
Brecht with HACAP said need increases in the food sector any time there is a real or perceived threat to benefits. He said partners in his region have said their communities are already preparing for that lapse in benefits to occur. For SNAP recipients, that might mean trying to stretch their October allotments, or making an extra trip to the food pantry. 
“We’re purchasing more food in anticipation for any sort of expanded shutdown to try to at least bolster our inventory and do our best to meet whatever need comes through the next week, month, etc.” Brecht said. 
Brecht said eligible Iowans can continue to sign up for SNAP, and he said they also should keep their electronic benefits cards — even if the shutdown persists into November — so that funds can be distributed quickly when they do become available.

Brecht and the other food bank officials pointed to advocacy as one of the most important ways that Iowans can help during this time. 
“Local, state, federally elected officials all need that education from folks that are that are concerned and folks that are either utilizing programs or have some insight,” Brecht said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds singled out congressional Democrats Thursday morning in a news release and called on her opposing party to end the shutdown before it caused “disruption” to SNAP benefits. 
“Because SNAP is fully funded and operated by the federal government, states are unable to step in and keep it running,” Reynolds said in the release. “But this issue could be resolved today if Senate Democrats would vote to reopen the government. If they continue to refuse, they’ll be choosing to put low-income American families at risk.” 
Republicans and Democrats in D.C. continue to be at odds and stalemate on key bills that would reopen the government. 
In addition to calling for an end to the shutdown, Reynolds directed Iowa HHS to remain in “regular contact” with Iowa food banks about their current inventories and abilities to increase distribution if necessary. 
“Our focus in Iowa will be on understanding the needs of food banks and pantries across the state and applying what we learned during the pandemic to support SNAP households if benefits are delayed,” Reynolds said. 
Prather with Northeast Iowa Food Bank said the state has been a “great partner” in the past and she appreciates the governor’s actions. 
“It takes all of us to make a difference in the lives of people in Iowa, not only private but also public support in that as well,” Prather said. “I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to work with her to help alleviate the need if the government continues to be closed.”
As Underhill put it, “many hands make light work.” In addition to calling and emailing congressional leaders, food bank leaders said Iowans can also volunteer at their local food pantries to help pack and organize donations, or they can make monetary or nonperishable food item donations.

While all donations are appreciated, the food bank leaders said monetary donations are especially prioritized because food banks and pantries have wholesale partnerships that allow them to spread each dollar further. 
If an organization is planning to host a food drive, or someone wants to donate food items instead, Underhill said things like canned goods, peanut butter, rice, boxed pasta, cereal, canned chicken and dried beans are some of the most useful items to donate. 
Other food banks echoed the same sentiments and said they are doing all they can to beef up their warehouses in anticipation of the need. 
Annette Hacker, communications manager for Food Bank of Iowa said while the food bank has “sound financial footing,” its resources are “not unlimited.” 
“We really can’t continue at the rate we’re going with purchased food,” Hacker said. “That said … we’ve been here a long time and will continue to be here, but we’re going to have to get more and more creative on how we source that food, how we deliver that food, how we fundraise. It is a very very challenging time.”

As the federal stalemate wears on, state officials are focusing on how they can get funds to households relying on food stamps, as well as heating benefits, if the shutdown continues into November.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
The Vermont Department for Children and Families said Wednesday it was directed by the federal government earlier this month to pause food stamp distribution for November due to the continued shutdown in Washington, D.C. State officials said Thursday that they’re rushing to deliver stopgaps for food and heating assistance.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed Vermont and other states in recent weeks that it did not have sufficient funds during the shutdown to operate its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through November. U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Peter Welch, D-Vt. co-signed a letter Wednesday calling on the USDA to use tools the legislators say are available to protect the program past the end of the month.

“Due to the current lack of funding, Vermonters receiving benefits are encouraged to plan ahead,” said the Wednesday release from the Vermont Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, the state’s nutrition assistance program.
The department said it could not provide further information on Thursday, and encouraged benefit recipients to “contact their local food shelves and community resources.”
As the federal stalemate wears on, state officials are focusing on how they can get funds to households relying on food stamps, as well as heating benefits, if the shutdown continues into November. So far, plans are not finalized, but lawmakers say state-funded stopgap measures for those benefits could be active by mid-November.
Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, who chairs the legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee, said she and her colleagues have been “doing everything we can to guarantee” that Vermonters are able to receive state funds to buy groceries.
“As someone who’s been on food stamps and gotten (heat assistance) dollars … I understand how scary it is to just read that everything’s going to be shut off without any information,” Kornheiser said.
The state’s Emergency Board — a body that includes the governor and heads of four legislative committees that manage public money — will be meeting to determine a solution next week, lawmakers said. 
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who serves on the Emergency Board as the head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he’s “confident that money will go out.”
What’s less certain, he said, is whether it will be the full amount of the original benefit, given the state has “little confidence” of federal reimbursement. Perchlik and House leaders expressed support Thursday for fully funded state coverage of 3SquaresVT.
Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor, said Thursday that the Scott administration will be presenting a plan to the Emergency Board in the coming days that “we hope they approve.”
Kornheiser said she has also been working to ensure that Low Income Heat Energy Assistance Program funds, which provide support to Vermonters during the cold winter months, will continue as normal. She expects the program, which like SNAP may see an absence of its normal influx of federal money, to be paid out as normal using state funds.
Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said the electronic benefit cards used to dispense the benefits are federally controlled, which adds to the complexity of the state’s challenge. 
“It’s not an unlimited amount of levers that we can pull,” Wood said. But like Kornheiser, she expressed cautious confidence about the state’s ability to get support to those in need, even if unusual means of dispensing funds become necessary.
Vermont’s 3SquaresVT program costs about $12 million each month, according to documents released last week by the state’s Legislative Joint Fiscal Office.
Ivy Enoch, the policy and advocacy director at Hunger Free Vermont, called the USDA’s messaging a “manufactured crisis.” In an open letter Thursday morning, Enoch’s organization called on Gov. Phil Scott to urge the USDA to keep SNAP benefits flowing into November.
“People are wondering how they’re going to buy groceries next week,” Enoch said, adding that the absence of federal cashflow will also hurt the state’s food vendors and broader economy.
“These are folks that don’t have the ability to simply plan ahead for an issue like this,” State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said Thursday. The vast majority of Vermonters who receive food stamps are older, have disabilities, or live in households with children, he said.
“We have the money,” Pieciak said, referencing money that Vermont has set aside to fill gaps in federal funding. “We just have to have a plan.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)NORTH CHARLESTON — On the wall at the front of Sydney Carroll’s classroom is a blue cutout reading “100%.”
The meaning is twofold: It’s a reminder to her eighth grade class that they should be giving 100% to their classwork, but it’s also a reminder to herself that she’s trying to get 100% of her students to read on grade level by the end of the year.
The more students Carroll moves toward that goal, the bigger her end-of-year bonus will be.
Carroll, who teaches English at Meeting Street’s Brentwood elementary and middle school, was one of 526 teachers across 39 schools to receive an Excellence in Teaching Award this year, totaling more than $4.6 million for kindergarten through eighth grade teachers whose students showed improvement and proficiency on end-of-year math and reading tests.
The average bonus totaled $8,800, according to Beemok Education in Charleston, which runs the program for many of the schools.
The pay-for-performance model has expanded since its 2021 inception in Charleston County to dozens of schools. The program’s leaders see it as a way of rewarding the best teachers and keeping them in the classroom. They want to see it expand to even more schools, using a mixture of private and public funds.

Carroll, who is in her sixth year of teaching, knew her students did well last year. She saw how hard they worked throughout the year, and their end-of-year test results reflected that.
Still, Carroll wasn’t expecting the phone call notifying her she won the year’s top award winner. Her prize: $57,250.
“I’m a teacher,” Carroll said. “I’ve never heard that amount — or even close to it.”
She cried when she heard the number.
She got used to living paycheck to paycheck, never saving more than a couple thousand dollars at a time. The lump sum was more than her annual salary for the first few years she spent teaching, she said.
Her bonus is more than the salary of many teachers across the state. This year, teachers can make no less than $48,500. Under the state-paid salary schedule, teachers with a bachelor’s degree don’t surpass $57,000 until their 18th year in the classroom.
With the bonus, Carroll, who is also a full-time graduate student, paid for a semester of school in cash, paid off debt, and saved the rest, she said.
She saw the bonus as a reflection of how much work she put into getting her students on grade level, including early mornings rehearsing lesson plans with principal Roger Michael and after-school grading sessions with friends.
Just 7% of Carroll’s 75 students, spread out across multiple classes throughout the day, were reading at an eighth grade level when they started last school year. By the end of the year, 45% were on grade level, with her students gaining, on average, about two years of progress.
‘What they deserve’
On a recent rainy Friday, Carroll told her students to grab their pencils and turn their attention to the front of the room.
“Alrighty, eighth grade,” Carroll said to start a reading assignment. Heads looked up from the poems students were reading to watch her.
“I love today,” Carroll continued. “It’s a challenge for us today, for sure, and that is OK, because that means we’re going to learn something.”
Fridays, especially one with a challenging lesson headed into a four-day weekend, can be tough, Carroll said. But her class remained rapt with attention as Carroll displayed one student’s responses to questions about the poem “This Is Just To Say” by William Carlos Williams, a personal favorite of the teacher’s.
Carroll asked her students: What was Williams literally saying in his poem? How did he change the style? What could the reader learn?
Carroll didn’t give the correct answers. During the two minutes the eighth graders had to read and analyze a poem, Carroll roamed the room, asking struggling students more questions to help them think about the assignment in a different way.

That’s what Carroll calls the “productive struggle,” and it’s what helps her students succeed, she said.
Reading, for them, is not just about seeing the words on the page but about constantly thinking and asking themselves questions. Her class moves at a quick clip, never giving students a moment to get bored.
“If I just stand up there and I’m like, ‘OK, so here are all the rules of poetry normally,’ none of them are doing the thinking,” Carroll later told the SC Daily Gazette.
Knowing she might get a bonus at the end of the year is not the reason Carroll wants to be a great teacher, she said.
The reason she gets to school over an hour before doors open, the reason she rehearses lesson plans with her principal, the reason she printed out the “100%” that hangs over her whiteboard, is because she sees how smart and hard-working her students are, and she wants to help them thrive.
Her bonus was a reflection of the time and effort she was already putting into her work, she said. But the idea of extra cash totaling tens of thousands of dollars is an extra incentive for her and other teachers to dig even deeper and work even harder, she said.
“Everyone’s really hungry,” Carroll said. “Everyone’s hungry to succeed for themselves and for the kiddos. That’s what they deserve.”
Bonuses
Brentwood was one of the original four “schools of innovation” to offer the bonuses in 2021. The program started in Meeting Street Schools, neighborhood schools that operate under a public-private partnership in an effort to give low-income students the support they need to succeed.
Since then, the approach has expanded, with 75 schools across the state offering bonuses using various funding sources.
The four Meeting Street Schools, along with 22 high-poverty elementary schools in Charleston County School District, receive funding from philanthropist Ben Navarro, who supports various education initiatives through Beemok Education.
That includes Brentwood, where more than 87% of students live in poverty.
Using federal funds, the state Department of Education began offering performance-based bonuses at schools in Allendale in Williamsburg counties, which the department manages, during the 2023-2024 school year. The state’s program grew to 37 schools last school year, with the help of $5 million from legislators, the department announced in March.
More K-12 teachers in SC can earn bonuses in $5M pilot program

Of the 34 schools added, 11 chose to use Beemok’s model, which compares students’ scores on district-level tests taken at the beginning and end of the school year. That model looks at both student growth and proficiency, rewarding teachers for how many grade levels their students advance in a single year and for how many students start testing on par with the grade they are in, according to their test results, said Josh Bell, president of Beemok Education.
Other schools opted to use results on state-standardized math and reading tests that every third- through eighth-grade student takes in the spring or create their own model to measure growth.
With another $5 million in the current year’s budget, the state-run pilot program could continue to expand. The Department of Education has not yet said where that money will go or released the results of its first year of the program.
Interest in expanding the program is there, Bell said. The Beemok Education-run program is continuing to grow, though a final number of schools eligible for the current school year is not yet finalized, he said. More than 110 schools applied for the state-run program last year, according to the Department of Education.
Whether state legislators continue to offer the bonuses will depend on what those results look like, said Rep. Neal Collins, an Easley Republican who sits on the House budget-writing panel for K-12 education.
“As with any new pilot program, I’d like to see the impact it has before drastic expansion,” said Collins, who’s also a member of the Education Oversight Committee.
Bell argues the data already exists through the privately funded bonuses in Meeting Street Schools.
And the results are promising, Bell said.
On average, student progress jumped forward about a year and a half in their reading and math skills during the most recent school year — the best outcomes so far in the program’s history, Bell said. And the program encourages outstanding teachers to stay in the profession, he said.
For Brentwood teacher Malik Anderson, who declined to disclose the amount he received, getting a bonus meant the difference between going on vacation during the school’s summer break and working a seasonal job to make ends meet.

Despite the seventh grade English teacher’s passion for the profession, he had to make hard decisions about whether to stay in the classroom or look for work elsewhere because of the pay, he said. Although he didn’t choose teaching for the money, the promise of bonuses if his students perform well means less stress over finances, he said.
“I don’t think anybody gets out of education because they don’t like it,” Anderson said. “I honestly think one of the determining factors is simply, sometimes you just simply can’t afford it, especially depending on where you live.”
Instead of telling great teachers they need to find an administrative job or take on the debt required to earn another degree, the bonuses allow them to stay in the classroom, where they are making a day-to-day impact on students, Bell said.
The Navarros haven’t capped total bonuses. They’re willing to fund whatever amount teachers earn, but they did decide to limit rewards to improvements in reading and math at high-poverty schools, Bell said.
That’s because math and reading are the foundational skills for all other subjects, Bell said.
More than half of the state’s third- through eighth-grade students can’t do math on grade level. And although reading scores jumped significantly during the most recent school year, 45% of students still are not reading on grade level, according to state test results. Students also tend to perform worse in poorer school districts, where the program is focused, according to state data.
“It’s undeniable that that’s what too many students are lacking skills in,” Bell said. “And those are the building blocks of almost everything else that you need to learn later.”
How teachers are paid
If legislators really want to make a change, they need to revamp how teachers are paid, Bell said.
For decades, teachers have been paid according to their years of classroom experience and level of college degree — making more annually as they move up the so-called salary schedule.
But years of experience and degrees don’t always correlate to student success, Bell said.
“What’s true is that some of the highest-performing teachers in our state are currently paid much less than some of the lowest-performing teachers in our state,” Bell said. “If you were building a school system from the start, you wouldn’t design it that way.”
But any change to that system is guaranteed to meet opposition. In 2019, a proposal directing the state Department of Education to come up with a way to eventually replace the salary steps met so much resistance, legislators quickly ditched the idea.
It’s unclear if legislators are willing to try again.
Teachers’ advocates, who have long fought proposed changes to how teachers are paid, aren’t against rewarding teachers for a job well done. The problem is figuring out how to do so fairly, said Patrick Kelly, lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Paying one teacher more than another with the same experience and same job solely because of student test scores would be unfair, he said.
But a bonus program that rewards excellent teachers for taking on extra duties outside of their classroom could be a way to move forward, he said.
“The key and the challenge is determining the criteria for awarding merit-based pay,” Kelly said.
A 2023 study legislators commissioned and Kelly helped craft recommended giving exemplary teachers assignments outside their normal work, then paying them stipends to cover the cost.
Under that model, teachers’ base pay would come from the number of years they’ve spent teaching, with additional amounts for getting additional degrees or working at underperforming schools. After a certain number of years in the classroom, teachers could then receive up to $10,000 on top of their normal salary if they agreed to help evaluate and coach fellow teachers.
That would allow teachers to expand their impact beyond their classroom, giving the state a better return on its investment, Kelly said.
“To me, that is the kind of performance pay I would like to see the state move toward,” Kelly said.
Legislators might be open to working through a way to pay teachers based on performance, but they would first need to see a proposal and study results, Collins said.
“I’m certainly open to the idea of making teacher pay less rigid than it is now,” Collins said.
Any sort of performance-based teacher pay would require hefty backing in the state budget. Legislators have put millions into raising the base pay for teachers in recent years, “but this is a whole another level of investment,” Kelly said.
“To have the impact that Meeting Street is having, you’re going to need substantial money behind it, and that’s going to be hard to find, especially in a fiscal environment where a lot of the conversation is around tax cuts, not around spending increases,” Kelly said.
Fairness concerns
Beemok’s Excellence in Teaching Awards model uses a formula based on how well students perform on district-wide tests at the beginning of the year versus the end. But how well a student does on a test is not always an accurate reflection of the quality of their teacher, Kelly said.
For instance, every teacher wants their students to show up to class every day, Kelly said, but that doesn’t happen.
A statewide study by the Education Oversight Committee found 1 in 5 students missed at least 10% of their school days during the 2022-2023 school year and that those students performed worse on end-of-year assessments than their peers.
Other teachers may be doing a stellar job but lack the testing with which to measure student growth, cutting them out of potential bonuses. Band and choir teachers, for example, can make a huge difference in a student’s life but would likely get left out of bonuses, said Kelly, who teaches Advanced Placement government at Blythewood High School.
SC students skip school a lot. The problem helps explain their dismal test scores, report finds.

“I know for a fact that some of the highest performing students in my AP (government) class thrive in school because of their fine arts instructors,” Kelly said. “That is the thing that keeps them engaged and thriving in school.”
A more consistent way of doling out bonuses for teachers could be looking at their annual reviews, which would give a clearer picture of how well they performed in metrics other than test scores, Kelly said.
Even that would require adjustment.
In some districts, principals simply rubber stamp their teachers’ evaluations. If that were to become the basis for a bonus, teachers in schools with less involved principals might receive higher bonuses than teachers whose principals took the time and effort to scrutinize their progress over the course of the year, which also isn’t fair, Kelly said. Teachers would need a more standardized system to be sure they were actually getting paid based on their success, he said.
“I think we have to tackle that first, and then we can have, I think, a more meaningful conversation about something like merit-based pay,” Kelly said.
Rewarding some teachers while others fall by the wayside for reasons that may be outside their control can cause divisions and unnecessary competition among teachers, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association.
Crews knows what it’s like to be the teacher not receiving an award. During her first year teaching a grade level with an end-of-year test, she was the only teacher in the school who didn’t meet the threshold of students on grade level to receive a gift bag at the end of the year, she said.
Crews’ students performed well in other ways, even if they didn’t necessarily meet their testing benchmarks, she said. Merit-based pay doesn’t account for all the other skills a student learns in class that may not show up on a test, she said.
“It was like I got slapped in the face, like the work that I did was meaningless because my kids didn’t perform on a one-time test,” Crews said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4827-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 18:16:39.121744

“Unless UAMS receives federal funding and a new federal contract to administer the Head Start program, this program will have to remain closed,” Head Start Program Director Tyra Larkin wrote to families in the program. “We understand how disruptive this will be for your family, and we are deeply sorry for the stress this may cause.”

Letter to Families 2_ 
The six facilities in Little Rock and North Little Rock serve 446 children and their families, and 130 employees will be furloughed due to the closures, UAMS spokesperson Leslie Taylor said.
Head Start provides free early childhood education to children between infancy and 5 years of age from low-income families. UAMS is one of 16 grantees for Head Start services throughout Arkansas.
Five percent of 4-year-olds and 7% of 3-year-olds in Arkansas were enrolled in Head Start during the 2023-24 academic year, according to a report from the National Institute for Early Education Research earlier this year.
The announcement comes as child care providers throughout Arkansas have been petitioning the state Department of Education for help in light of both the government shutdown and changes to the state’s School Readiness Assistance Program. The financial aid program for low-income families to access child care relies on a federal grant that the shutdown has withheld, and federal funding for child care was already steadily decreasing, state Division of Elementary and Secondary Education officials said.
The Arkansas Early Childhood Commission created an emergency working group of researchers, lawmakers and child care providers with the goal of assisting and advising the state Office of Early Childhood on how to keep child care services afloat and sustainable by Nov. 1.
As of Thursday, an end to the shutdown remained out of reach as congressional Democrats and Republicans continued not to make progress on federal budget negotiations. The 23-day shutdown is the second-longest in American history.

Three members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said Thursday that the United States Department of Agriculture has all the money it needs to keep food assistance flowing to 42 million Americans in November, despite officials’ claims otherwise.
In a little more than a week, more than 450,000 New Mexicans will likely not receive SNAP payments, according to state officials. That’s because the USDA on Oct. 10 sent state SNAP administrators a letter ordering them not to send SNAP recipient information to statewide vendors due to “insufficient funds” resulting from the ongoing federal government shutdown.
But U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, said Thursday that the USDA has access to $5 billion in SNAP “contingency funds” it could use to keep SNAP recipients fed.
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

“President Trump could act today to make sure families don’t go hungry — but instead he’s using hunger as punishment while taking $200 million from billionaires for a gilded ballroom and sending a $40 billion bailout to Argentina. That’s cruel. That’s un-American,” Leger Fernández said in a statement. 
Food and Nutrition Services, the USDA division that runs SNAP, did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Thursday about why it isn’t using contingency funds — money Leger Fernández said was “set aside specifically for emergencies like this” — to keep benefits flowing through Thanksgiving despite the shutdown. 
In addition to the statement, Leger Fernández joined about 180 colleagues in signing a letter regarding SNAP expected to be sent tomorrow, according to her spokesperson. Democratic members of the Senate, including U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, sent their own letter to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins earlier Thursday. 
The latter letter also notes the USDA’s contingency funding as one example of the agency having sufficient funding and authority to avoid any lapse in SNAP funding. 
“Americans are already struggling with the rising cost of groceries, and they cannot afford a sudden lapse in grocery assistance,” the letter reads. 
NM food banks say they have no time to prepare for Nov. 1 SNAP stoppage 

New Mexico has the highest rate of SNAP reliance in the country, with $90 million in benefits serving 250,000 households hanging in the balance come Nov. 1. Food banks across the state are gearing up to meet the increased demand, though food bank leaders told state lawmakers Wednesday they do not have the capacity to meet an increase in demand for food. 
Michael Coleman, Gov. Michellle Lujan Grisham’s communications director, told Source in a statement Wednesday evening that the governor is “carefully assessing options for those whose benefits could be abruptly cut off Nov. 1.” 
However, spokespersons from the Health Care Authority, which administers SNAP, and the governor’s office did not provide further comment Thursday about how the state might intervene to save the benefits. 
“Gov. Lujan Grisham is fully aware and deeply concerned that food security is in grave jeopardy for nearly a half-million New Mexicans who rely on the SNAP program,” Coleman said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0931-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 18:16:39.121744

Federal cuts will make it harder,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/23/federal-cuts-medicaid-access/,"Kimberly Todd qualifies for Medicaid, but the difficulty she has faced getting on the program over the last few months reveals the cracks poor people fall through when trying to get assistance from the social programs that purportedly exist to help them.","LAMAR – Kimberly Todd sat in a brown and gold upholstered chair on her front porch at the end of a long dirt driveway on a cloudy September afternoon. Wearing jeans and a crimson blouse, it’s the most dressed up she’s been in months, she says. 
Tight clothing, socks and shoes make her skin feel like it’s on fire – a symptom of fibromyalgia she has lived with for four years without health insurance. A single mother of five, Todd also has endured numbness in her abdomen, pain in her uterus and two periods a month as a result of complications from a C-section in 2021. 
Todd qualifies for Medicaid, but the difficulty she has faced getting on the program over the last few months reveals the cracks poor people fall through when trying to get assistance from the social programs that purportedly exist to help them. Mississippi has among the strictest Medicaid income eligibility requirements in the nation. People must meet the income threshold, which amounts to less than $500 per month for a family of three and is a fraction of the federal poverty level. They also face bureaucratic red tape and punitive measures for missteps that often force them into deeper holes. 
Her most recent barrier to getting health care? The state has asked Todd to file for child support from her ex-boyfriend. This little-known Medicaid requirement has translated to four months of back-and-forth with caseworkers, miscommunication among state agencies, delayed medical care and the possibility of sending the father of her two youngest children to jail. 
“I want to take care of my family – that’s it,” Todd said. “Something I never had growing up.”
Whether or not it’s intentional, social safety net programs end up shutting out eligible people through “unnecessary complexity,” explained Daniel Dawes, an attorney and founding dean of Meharry Medical College in Nashville who helped write the Affordable Care Act, widely considered the most progressive health care legislation since the formation of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965. 
“Many of these programs are designed as if they’re intended to keep people in perpetual poverty,” Dawes said. “Instead of making allowances and helping people to maneuver out of that.”
By all accounts, people in circumstances like Todd motivated lawmakers to create the Medicaid program. Todd has worked multiple jobs – from cleaning houses and hotels and working in convenience stores to fixing cars and broken phones. She has worked in grueling conditions so that she can care for the three children ages 4 to 18 in her custody – two of whom have autism. 
She has no family in the state and lives in what she calls “a shack” on an acre of wooded land without the resources to put her kids in afterschool activities like art classes or programs for autistic children. Todd and her children lack the community safety net most people take for granted. 
“Most people have family, friends – I don’t even have a friend,” Todd said. “I don’t have one friend.”
Medicaid would be her safety net – at least in theory. But the system has been failing her. 
“I will work myself literally to death and not have any health care coverage,” Todd said. “Who’s going to take care of my autistic child when I pass away? Where is she going to go? She can’t talk. Who’s going to hurt her while I’m not here?”
‘I didn’t want that for my kids’
The child support requirement aims to help single parents. In practice, research suggests it can be harmful for families – yet it pervades most social safety net programs. 
“It may be that a family already has informal arrangements for all the parents to financially contribute to the child’s wellbeing, and complying with this requirement through the state can disrupt those informal arrangements that are working better for families in many cases,” explained Matt Williams, director of research with the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. 
That’s the case with Todd. She said she is on good terms with her ex-boyfriend and often gives him a place to stay. She said she is hoping to help him get back on his feet so he can start working again after his own mental health conditions and lack of insurance made working impossible. He doesn’t qualify for Medicaid because his biological children are not in his custody. Mississippi’s version of Medicaid does not insure childless adults. 
In other cases, being forced to file for child support with the non-custodial parent could have dangerous repercussions. 
“For any one of a number of reasons, including concern for their own physical wellbeing, they might be reluctant to identify someone,” said Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who previously told Mississippi Today “the child support system in Mississippi is f-cked up, and no one knows how to unf-ck it.”
Exemptions to the rule technically exist for those who are concerned for their own or their children’s safety. In practice they are very difficult to obtain, explained Williams. 
“It’s not always the case that they are granted that exemption if they don’t have the right kind of legal paper trail, court documents or restraining orders,” he said. “If they’re unable to prove through documentation that they are experiencing domestic violence or fleeing domestic violence, they may not get that exemption.”
In Todd’s case, filing for child support from her former partner in August was an impossible decision. She worries the missed payments she knows he will incur will put him in jail. 
“How is he going to help me from jail?” Todd asked. “What sense does that make?”
She knows this situation all too well. Her own driver’s license was revoked twice in the last year after she fell behind on child support payments to the father of her two children who are not in her custody. She has not been able to pay off the most recent fine since she is out of work, making it harder for her to find work and to take her non-verbal autistic daughter to therapy. 
What makes the child support requirement even more harmful in Todd’s case is that evidence suggests it was implemented incorrectly. States are only allowed to ask applicants to agree to comply with requirements at the time of application, according to several national Medicaid experts who spoke to Mississippi Today. States cannot force applicants to file for child support before they are approved for Medicaid. But according to Todd, they did. 
“Part of that’s just practicality,” said Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “In the application timeframe, filing for child support is not something that can always be completed before the state’s deadline and it’s counter to the concept of Medicaid and providing timely care.”
Mississippi Division of Medicaid Spokesperson Matt Westerfield confirmed applicants cannot be required to file for child support until after their Medicaid application is approved. He did not respond to a request for comment on Todd’s case. 
Once Mississippi Today informed her of state and federal law, Todd went back to her case worker in mid-October with the information, at which point they told her she should expect an approval letter in the mail in a week.
According to Todd, the caseworker alleged over the phone that Todd had been approved for Medicaid in August, failed to comply with the child support requirement, and had her coverage rescinded. But Todd says the application in her online portal went from “processing” to “denied,” and she never got an approval letter in the mail. 
Her online portal finally said “eligible” on Wednesday – nearly four months after her initial application. But Todd has yet to receive her official approval letter and insurance card in the mail  – and she can’t start using her coverage until then, according to the Mississippi Division of Medicaid site.  
It’s not uncommon for Medicaid requirements to be implemented incorrectly at the local level, according to Tricia Brooks, a research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. 
“Although we don’t have hard data, we consistently hear about errors made by eligibility workers or misinformation provided by call center staff,” Brooks said. “Unfortunately, applicants and enrollees are often unaware of their right to a fair hearing and hit roadblocks in getting accurate information.”
Before Todd got sick, life wasn’t much easier. 
The last time Todd and her former partner were working full-time, they were told they made too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Together, they struggled to cover rent and utilities and had no money left over for food – much less health insurance. They got by on provisions from a nearby church, but they only ever ate “peanut butter and jelly and noodles,” Todd said. 
Since then, her health has deteriorated to the point that she can no longer work. As a result, Todd qualifies for Medicaid. Advocates for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi have long sounded the alarms on this paradox. In one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid, Mississippi could have covered tens of thousands more working people who do not earn enough to pay for their own insurance – people like Todd. 
Nearly a quarter of people in Marshall County, where Todd lives in the northern part of the state, are living below the poverty line, according to the Mississippi Department of Employment Security. That’s more than double the national average. Todd grew up in poverty, but she always thought it was an escapable fate. She’s since lost all faith in the system.
“I grew up in nasty houses with roaches and rats and holes in the floor and no money and starving – I grew up like that,” Todd reflected. “I didn’t want that for my kids. But there’s nothing I can do. I see how hard it is now.”
Widening gaps
Government programs are not universally difficult to apply for. Those serving poor people tend to be far more wrapped up in red tape, unequally levying what’s called “the time tax.” A 2021 Atlantic article written by Annie Lowrey sums it up: the time tax is regressive. 
“Programs for the wealthy tend to be easy, automatic, and guaranteed. You do not need to prostrate yourself before a caseworker to get the benefits of a 529 college-savings plan. You do not need to urinate in a cup to get a tax write-off for your home, boat, or plane. You do not need to find a former partner to get a child-support determination as a prerequisite for profiting from a 401(k).”
Application processes for government programs aimed at the wealthy are so much easier that many affluent people don’t even realize they’re benefiting from them, according to a survey conducted by political scientist Suzanne Mettler at Cornell University. 
In Mettler’s survey, the majority of high-income participants initially said they had never used a government safety net program. When told what counted as a government program, 96% reported they had. 
The wealth gap will widen and the time tax inequality will increase under President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, experts warn. The new law contains the largest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, or food stamps, in history. 
“We know that programs like SNAP and Medicaid reduce poverty, and so if they’re less available, we can expect poverty and hardships to rise,” said Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. “And we also know that the tax cuts for higher income groups are designed to boost those incomes, so you can just do the math without even having to do the math.”
Strict policies and cuts to Medicaid and food aid disproportionately harm women – a fact Todd knows firsthand. In her community, she says many mothers she knows are dropping dead because of heart attacks, too sick to take care of their kids, or committing suicide – a fate she almost fell prey to except that she didn’t want to repeat the generational trauma with which she grew up. 
“I know how it is to live without a parent because my mom mentally and emotionally wasn’t there, and I would never do that to my kids,” Todd said. “That’s the only reason why I’m here. I promise you, if it wasn’t for them, I would not be here. This world is too much for me, trying to just survive with nobody.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02125852/for-sophia.jpg,,,2025-10-23 18:16:39.121744

(Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)As new details surface about the state’s failure to evaluate and repair longstanding problems with the Washington Bridge, Rhode Island lawmakers are enlisting a former federal law enforcement officer to probe deeper.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson announced late Thursday that former U.S. Attorney Zachary A. Cunha has been brought on to help the General Assembly conduct an upcoming oversight hearing on the bridge failure – now scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 13.

Cunha served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 2021 to 2025, ousted after President Donald Trump took office. He now works in private practice as a partner at Nixon & Peabody LLP in Providence.  
“A career public servant, Attorney Cunha’s vast experience will enhance the conduct of a fair and robust inquiry by our oversight committees without unnecessary impact on the state’s ongoing lawsuit related to the Washington Bridge,” Shekarchi and Lawson said in a joint statement Thursday. “He has consistently demonstrated impartiality, integrity and a high degree of skill across the legal landscape while serving as U.S. Attorney.”
The news comes less than one month after the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office lifted the veil on a long-sequestered audit of the bridge’s condition. The 64-page report was posted on the AG’s website on Sept. 26 after pieces were leaked by an anonymous social media account. It paints a damning picture for state officials and administrators for failing to notice or remedy the highway’s deteriorating condition, despite nearly two decades of inspections and repairs exposing the structural problems.
Since the document went public, additional details have come to light, including omitted excerpts from the analysis and correspondence between members of the consulting company hired to perform the review, as first reported by the Providence Journal on Oct. 21. 
Shekarchi and Lawson said the upcoming legislative probe was prompted by the audit report and other new information about the bridge. 
Since the westbound highway’s abrupt closure in December 2023, the Rhode Island General Assembly has already exercised its oversight authority twice — in February 2024 and February 2025 — though the latter served more as an information session than a grilling of state leaders. In neither instance were witnesses put under oath during their testimony.
This time, lawmakers expect to formally swear in witnesses before taking their comments and asking questions. 
It remains undecided whether subpoenas will be issued for the upcoming probe, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, said in an email Thursday.
Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti is expected to cooperate and attend the hearing, given that Alviti attended the last two rounds of probes voluntarily, Berman said.
A spokesperson for the state transportation agency did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment late Thursday.
McKee has already signaled his opposition to putting state employees, including Alviti, under oath, warning it could jeopardize the state’s ongoing lawsuit against contractors involved in bridge inspection and repairs. 
But Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose office is leading the state’s lawsuit, has already made clear that swearing in state employees to testify about the bridge will not impede the state’s legal case.
“The people of Rhode Island deserve transparency and accountability, and I support Speaker Shekarchi and Senate President Lawson in their mission here,” Neronha said in a statement. “Though my office seeks to hold accountable several contractor companies for what we allege was negligent behavior, that doesn’t mean those in state leadership charged with maintaining our roads and bridges get a free pass. We must know the full truth, and these hearings can absolutely provide helpful insight.”
The complaint seeking damages for the state’s losses from the bridge closure is tentatively scheduled to go to trial in late 2027.
The meeting on Nov. 13 will be held in the State House’s basement, televised live by Capitol TV, and live streamed at https://capitoltvri.cablecast.tv/. A time has not been set as of Thursday.

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 22, 2025.
NORTH HAVERHILL — The man serving a mandatory life sentence for murdering two Dartmouth College professors 24 years ago has cleared another legal hurdle in his effort to become eligible for parole.
A state Superior Court judge this week denied a request by prosecutors to reconsider his ruling on the constitutionality of the New Hampshire law mandating minors guilty of certain crimes be sentenced to life without the possibility of being released from prison.
Robert Tulloch, 43, of Chelsea, is serving two consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of Dartmouth professors Half and Susanne Zantop at their Etna home in 2001 when he was 17 years old.
James Parker, Tulloch’s accomplice in the stabbings, who was 16 at the time and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, was paroled from prison in 2024 after serving nearly all the minimum length of his 25-years-to-life sentence.
Under state law, the sentence Tulloch received was automatic given the crime, despite his age. For years, he has been seeking a new sentencing hearing on grounds that mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for minors are illegal. In July, Judge Lawrence MacLeod of Grafton County Superior Court agreed.
The judge found that the state law that requires lifetime prison sentences for defendants convicted of capital offenses violates the “cruel and unusual” clause under the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution when imposed on a juvenile.
State prosecutors quickly filed a motion asking MacLeod to reconsider his ruling and submitted several arguments they contended undercut the judge’s opinion. But MacLeod, in an eight-page decision dated Oct. 20, remained unpersuaded by the state’s arguments that he erred in applying the “evolving standards of decency” that in part led him to conclude that denying any hope for parole to a juvenile violated the state’s constitution.
The ruling was within the bounds of statutes and case law that “allow consideration of facts outside of New Hampshire legislative history in determining whether LWOP sentences for minors were both ‘cruel’ and ‘unusual,’” MacLeod wrote, using an acronym for “life without parole.”
He agreed with the defense’s claim that “juvenile LWOP could not have been understood or accepted as a penalty for crimes to the framers in 1784,” when neither sentences of life imprisonment nor prisons fitting any modern definition of the term existed.
Michael Garrity, spokesman for the New Hampshire Department of Justice, said via email that department officials “will review the order and respond as appropriate in court.”
What happens next is unclear but there are at least three possible paths.
The first is the state could accept the ruling and agree to a new sentencing hearing for Tulloch. A hearing date has not yet been set but the clerk’s office is required to set a date within 30 days of the Oct. 20 decision.
The second path is that prosecutors appeal MacLeod’s ruling to the state Supreme Court, which has not yet addressed the sentencing issue and could settle the questions once and for all.
A third possibility is that prosecutors and defense attorneys avoid the uncertainty of returning to court and enter into settlement discussions to negotiate a new sentence for Tulloch.

The revised pleading that Anné Minard entered Thursday in Ingham County Circuit Court will see her accept guilt for filing a fraudulent income tax return and another charge of embezzlement from a nonprofit campaign and organizing fund she and Robert Minard controlled in conjunction with Lee Chatfield and his wife, Stephanie.
Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office issued a news release on the agreement following a hearing before Ingham Circuit Judge James Jamo.
Anné Minard and the attorney general’s office agreed that she would serve six months in jail on a suspended sentence with 36 months probation and fines, Bridge Michigan reported.
“As a condition of the plea agreement, Minard has agreed to provide truthful testimony in future hearings,” the attorney general’s office said. “Minard is additionally required to pay full restitution for amounts owed to the Michigan Department of Treasury.”
She will next appear in court before Jamo for sentencing on Dec. 3. The judge has the latitude to deviate from the agreed upon sentence if he pleases.
There was no plea deal entered for Robert Minard, who still faces trial on multiple felonies related to running a criminal enterprise and misappropriating funds connected to Lee Chatfield.
With Anné Minard’s new plea deal, she will likely testify during trial proceedings for both Lee and Stephanie Chatfield, which have been set for Sept. 21, 2026, through Oct. 9, 2026.

It is alleged that Lee and Stephanie Chatfield, beginning in 2021, used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at luxe stores like Coach, items at amusement parks like Universal Studios, while Lee Chatfield also spent lavishly at strip clubs and partied with his associates and brothers.
An investigation into Chatfield began after his former sister-in-law reported to Lansing police an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting when she was 14 or 15 years old.
Although those allegations did not result in criminal charges, it did ensnare the Chatfields in the financial crimes investigation, and by proxy, the Minards.

In a letter to legislators, Scott cited constitutional provisions and joint resolutions authorizing the General Assembly to reconvene the 2024 Special Session I “to consider matters properly before the ongoing session and any related business laid before the body.” 
The House will meet at 4 p.m. Monday in the Capitol chamber, he wrote, adding that the clerk’s office will soon provide logistical details.
“My office has spoken with Senate leadership and has been assured that a similar communication … will be made by the Senate Clerk’s Office to Senate members,” Scott wrote. 
He did not explain why the legislature is being recalled, and neither he nor Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, responded to inquiries from The Mercury on Thursday.
 Redistricting speculation

Several Democrats and legislative staffers told Virginia Scope that part of the session’s focus will be redistricting — a move that could reopen debate over how Virginia’s 11 congressional boundaries are drawn. Six of these are currently held by Democrats, and sources told the outlet that Democrats in Washington believe a new map could yield at least two additional Democratic-leaning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Virginia voters in 2020 approved a constitutional amendment creating an independent redistricting commission of lawmakers and citizens, but the panel deadlocked in late 2021, leaving the Virginia Supreme Court to draw the current maps. 
With Democrats now holding narrow control of both legislative chambers, some strategists have discussed using their majorities to revisit that framework.
Options under discussion include breaking up heavily Democratic districts to make them more competitive while reshaping Republican-leaning areas to favor Democratic candidates. 
Timing is key — under Virginia’s amendment process, a constitutional change must be approved twice by the General Assembly with a House election in between before being placed on the ballot for voter approval or rejection.
According to Virginia Scope, Democratic leaders are considering an initial vote before the Nov. 4 election, followed by a second vote during the 2026 session, potentially allowing a referendum next spring and new maps as early as April — two months before congressional primaries.
Still, many Democratic lawmakers remain uneasy about the plan. Senate Democrats held a caucus meeting Wednesday night, and several members told the outlet they had been “kept out of the loop” about the special-session agenda.
 National backdrop

Across the country, redistricting battles are intensifying as both parties look to lock in advantages ahead of the 2026 midterms. 
Earlier on Thursday, the New York Times reported that Virginia’s Democratic leaders are considering “joining a growing number of states” seeking to counter what they call partisan gerrymandering efforts encouraged by the administration of President Donald Trump.
“We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” Surovell told the Times, suggesting Democrats view their move as a corrective to Republican-led redistricting maneuvers in states such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. 
Those states have recently pushed new maps designed to cement GOP control after a series of federal court rulings loosened constraints on mid-decade remapping. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana, another sign of how important the issue is to legislators and voters nationwide.
In August, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, hinted publicly that Virginia could soon act. 
Sharing a post by former President Barack Obama on X, formerly Twitter, praising California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approach to mid-decade redistricting, Lucas wrote: “Every state in the nation should follow suit. Stay tuned for Virginia …”
 Political fallout

Republicans swiftly accused Democrats of scheming to rewrite the rules ahead of a pivotal statewide election. 
Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, in a video on X characterized Scott’s move a sign of Democratic desperation. 
“Desperate Democrats are pulling a pathetic, political stunt,” Peake said, accusing the majority of “doing anything they can to take attention away from their horrible candidates.” 
He added that “the General Assembly hopes they can do something with this ruse about redistricting,” but urged voters not to “fall for it.” 
The campaign of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, blamed Democratic contender Abigail Spanberger for supporting the idea of dissolving the independent commission.
“In a stunning display of arrogance, Abigail Spanberger wants to overrule the will of Virginia voters in favor of a cynical power grab,” campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement Thursday. 
“She came out in favor of abolishing Virginia’s Independent Redistricting Commission and wants to hand control back to the politicians in Richmond so they can guarantee their own reelection. … It’s never been about the voters or what’s best for Virginia. It’s always been about what’s best for Abigail Spanberger.”
However, in an interview with WJLA in late August, Spanberger said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
 What comes next

With the state legislature reconvening Monday afternoon, both chambers are expected to gavel in briefly before potentially taking up redistricting-related measures later in the week. 
Procedural resolutions adopted earlier this year would allow lawmakers to address “matters properly before the ongoing special session,” giving Scott wide latitude to add topics to the agenda.
Any move to alter Virginia’s redistricting process would likely trigger intense legal scrutiny and political backlash — especially given the proximity to Election Day. But Democratic strategists across the country argue that Republican-led states have already rewritten maps to their advantage.

Idahoans may visit voteidaho.gov until 5 p.m. local time Friday to request an absentee ballot for free or pre-register to vote for the Nov. 4 election, the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office said in a news release issued Thursday. 
“As the election approaches, I encourage every Idahoan to make a plan and be ready to vote in the local elections on Tuesday, November 4th,” Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said in a written statement. “Pre-registering at VoteIdaho.gov is quick and straightforward, and it’s the best way to ensure you’re prepared for Election Day. For those voting absentee, this Friday is especially important, as it’s also the deadline to request your ballot. VoteIdaho.gov is your trusted resource to get the information you need and to make your voice heard in your community.”
Idahoans who request an absentee ballot by Friday’s deadline will receive their ballot in the mail and must complete it and return it so it is received by local elections officials by the time polls close at 8 p.m. local time Nov. 4. It is not enough to simply have the absentee ballot postmarked by Election Day; instead local election officials must physically receive the absentee ballot by the time polls close in order for the ballot to be counted.

Depending on where they live, Idahoans may have a mayor’s race, city council election, school board election, school district levy, a public safety levey, an open spaces levy, cemetery district or other local taxing district election to vote on during the Nov. 4 election. 
Voters can visit voteidaho.gov to view their sample ballot and find out in advance what will be on their ballot. 
In Idaho, voting by absentee ballot is one of several options for voting. If voters miss Friday’s deadline or do not want to vote by absentee ballot, they may participate in early voting until Oct. 31 or vote in-person at their local polling place from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 4.
Eligible voters who do not pre-register to vote online by the Oct. 24 deadline still have the option to register to vote in person at their polling place when they go to vote. To register to vote, Idahoans must present a current valid photo ID and proof of residence. According to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office, a current valid Idaho driver’s license with the voter’s current address satisfies both the photo ID and proof of residency requirements. Other acceptable forms of photo ID include an Idaho identification card, a passport or federal ID, a Tribal ID or a concealed weapons permit issued by an Idaho sheriff’s office. Acceptable forms of proof of residency include a lease agreement or mortgage, proof of insurance, a bank or credit card statement, a pay stub, a utility bill that is not a cell phone bill, or an enrollment letter from an Idaho high school or college.

Brian Kemp's office on Oct. 23, 2025 in Atlanta. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder A coalition of environmental organizations delivered more than 24,000 petition signatures and nearly 300 pieces of artwork from children to Gov. Brian Kemp’s office Thursday, urging him to permanently protect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
The groups, which included Environment Georgia, Garden Club of Georgia, Georgia Interfaith Power and Light and others, called on the governor to support pending legislation to ban future surface mining on the refuge’s Trail Ridge, a geological feature that contains valuable minerals but also serves as a barrier protecting the Okefenokee. House Bill 561, known as the “Okefenokee Protection Act” and sponsored by Rep. Darlene Taylor, a Thomasville Republican, has not yet passed out of the House Natural Resources and Environment Committee.
An Alabama-based company, Twin Pines Minerals, dropped its plans to mine Trail Ridge this summer and said that it would instead sell 8,000 acres near the refuge. In the 1990s, DuPont also attempted to mine near the swamp. 
“The immediate threat to the swamp has been resolved, but that does not mean the Okefenokee is safeguarded for future generations,” said Jennette Gayer, state director of Environment Georgia, which collected a large majority of the signatures.

The legislation aims to prohibit the state’s Environmental Protection Division from issuing future mining permits in the area. The bill states that the director of the division “shall not issue, modify, or renew any permit or accept any bond to conduct surface mining operations on Trail Ridge for any permit application or permit amendment.”  The bill makes the case that the Okefenokee Swamp “is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for regulation and protection.”
The bill also warns that surface mining “risks adverse impacts to the wetlands, water quality and quantity, wildlife habitat, air quality, and wilderness values of the Okefenokee Swamp.” Taylor pointed to those concerns in a phone interview Thursday, warning that a drained swamp could lead to catastrophic forest fires and change the entire ecosystem.
“My big fear, especially with the mining, was once you perforate and get into the underneath, it won’t be what you see on the surface to begin with. It would drain out of the swamp, and as it would drain out, the swamp would become drier,” she said.
Supporters argue that Kemp’s backing is needed to move the legislation through the House and Senate. Aside from passing Taylor’s bill, Gayer said Kemp could support designating the Okefenokee as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a designation former Gov. Sonny Perdue supported and one that proponents say would spur economic development through tourism. Gayer also suggested Kemp could support or allocate funds for the purchase of land or mineral rights along the rest of Trail Ridge to permanently protect the area for conservation.

Josh Marks of Georgians for the Okefenokee, who has been involved with conservation efforts for nearly 30 years, criticized the governor’s silence on the issue. Marks said that he was disappointed the governor has not publicly addressed the issue and challenged the governor to “put the word conserve back into conservative and lead the charge to permanently protect Trail Ridge.”
“We’re here today to tell Gov. Kemp to protect the Okefenokee Swamp once and for all,” Marks said.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
But Rep. John Corbett, a Lake Park Republican whose district includes the refuge, said that if signed into law, the bill would impose on landowners’ property rights, saying that it would be equal to “taking (property) without compensating the owner.”
“To go in there and take their right, you’re taking somebody’s property,” he said.
Corbett, however, said that he supports protecting the Okefenokee Swamp by selling the land that could be mined, whether to environmental groups, the state or the federal government, if they can work out a deal with the landowners.
Despite opposition over concerns about property rights, Taylor said she has received more calls on the issue than on any other in her 15 years as a lawmaker in south Georgia, adding that they have come not only from Georgia but also “from across the country and even internationally.”
“It is important to the world, to Georgia and to our country. It is a very important issue. There’s only one Okefenokee,” she said.
Marqus Cole, organizing director for Georgia Interfaith Power and Light, approached the issue as a matter of morality, saying that people of faith across Georgia “recognize the Okefenokee as a sacred trust” that must be passed onto future generations.
“The Okefenokee is more than just a landscape. It’s a living testament to creations, beauty and balance,” Cole said. “There’s a piece of faith wisdom that says we don’t inherit the earth from our ancestors, we steward it for the next generation.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/92f610f2-a5e5-4d0c-b173-70596d9ab1061-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:57:21.293207

A Scott administration return-to-office mandate will kick in December 1. The employees’ union says the Waterbury office lacks enough desks to accommodate workers assigned there. Administration officials say they’re working to address the space needs.

WATERBURY — Emily Weidman and her fiance planned to pare down to one car in order to save for a home. 
But that plan changed when Gov. Phil Scott announced state employees would need to return to the office at least three days per week starting Dec. 1. 
“We can’t do that now,” said Weidman, a Department of Vermont Health Access employee.

Weidman, who typically works in person once a month, was one of hundreds of employees within the Agency of Human Services who showed up to the state office complex in Waterbury Thursday to demonstrate the impact of the looming return-to-office order. Many wore green or union T-shirts to show their solidarity in opposition to the mandate. 
After first previewing the hybrid return-to-office plan this summer, Scott and his administration have released additional details sporadically, recently specifying the limited exceptions to the mandate for state workers currently living outside Vermont. 
Administration officials say working in person will increase collaboration and preserve institutional knowledge, while also improving customer service for Vermonters who want to interact with their government face-to-face. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, has fiercely criticized the initiative, arguing it will cause experienced employees to quit, decreasing the quality of state departments’ work. State surveys conducted by the Vermont Department of Human Resources show the vast majority of state employees who work at least sometimes remotely say the flexibility helps their productivity and still allows them to collaborate effectively.

Despite the financial impact on her, Weidman said she was more concerned about the hybrid plan’s impact on her colleagues who live farther from Waterbury or out of state. She expects to lose colleagues who can’t meet the initiative’s requirements.
“Lot’s going to change if we lose these people who have been here 15 years,” she said.

Then there’s the matter of space. Thursday’s demonstration coincided with a Vermont Department of Health all-team meeting, and the employees’ union said the department is short more than 250 desks in Waterbury to accommodate all the Health Department’s staff assigned to the office complex. 
“This is an attempt to show what this would be like,” Noah Detzer, a Health Department employee, said of the union’s organizing effort. “It’s going to be people on top of each other, multiple people at a desk.”
An internal evaluation by the Vermont Department of Health last month identified a gap of 254 desks at the Waterbury office, according to Kyle Casteel, a department spokesperson.
In an email, Sarah Clark, Vermont’s secretary of administration and the face of the administration’s hybrid mandate, wrote that state leaders are “actively working to address the space needs and develop solutions to accommodate the (Agency of Human Services) workforce.” She also acknowledged that the closure of a state office building in Burlington added to the Health Department’s space constraints.
But Clark noted that Thursday’s union demonstration, which requested 100% in-person attendance, may not accurately reflect what will happen starting Dec. 1, because the two remote days built into the administration’s plan will allow employees to work in the office on a staggered schedule. And on average, 199 employees currently work at the central complex in Waterbury, which has 881 seats, producing an average daily vacancy rate of 77%, according to data Clark shared. 
Detzer and other Health Department employees said they were concerned the return-to-office requirements would limit staff recruitment to the I-89 highway corridor, inhibiting people in rural Vermont from being able to work for the state. And they expect to lose institutional knowledge as employees who can’t meet the order retire or find other jobs, they said, a setback taxpayers will feel.

“It’s going to be a very different health department,” said Detzer, who typically commutes once a week from Essex.  
Samantha Stalford, another Health Department employee, said concerns about vacancies spurred by the return-to-office mandate threatened to overshadow the daily work of state government. Recruiting new workers and figuring out how to divide up the responsibilities of people who are leaving would take its toll, she said. 
“There’s just been a lot of chaos,” Stalford said, “rather than just doing our jobs.”

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is running on funds left over from the previous fiscal year, and the health department spends $5 million per month on the program, Adams told the State Board of Health at its quarterly meeting.
“There is some discussion from USDA [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] that we may receive some additional dollars that would allow us to operate beyond that,” Adams said. “So right now, that program is fully functioning uninterrupted, but we do have a finite number of funds there.”
USDA officials said Oct. 13 that WIC would stay afloat until the end of this month thanks to a $300 million transfer from the agency’s child nutrition programs account.
Adams’ statement came a day after the Department of Human Services warned Arkansans to prepare themselves for possible interruptions to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments due to the shutdown.
Shutdown likely to halt food benefits for 42 million in just days

More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, as of Sept. 1, according to a DHS press release.
Nationally, more than 42 million low-income Americans are at risk of losing food assistance Nov. 1 if the government shutdown continues.
SNAP-eligible Arkansans currently must have a gross income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines — currently $19,578 for an individual and $40,560 for a family of four — and a net income below 100% of this threshold.
However, WIC-eligible Arkansans’ income must be below 185% of the federal poverty line, which is $27,861 for an individual and $57,720 for a family of four. 66,689 Arkansans currently receive WIC benefits, Health Department spokesperson Ashley Whitlow said Thursday.
Arkansas has the nation’s highest rate of food insecurity, according to a USDA report released in September 2024.
Even if members of Congress reached a deal to end the 23-day shutdown immediately, the time needed to process SNAP payments and make them available for recipients means benefits would likely be delayed.
Adams told the Board of Health that the Health Department’s only area directly affected by the shutdown is its certification and survey program that receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Sixteen employees have been partially furloughed and one has been fully furloughed since Oct. 1, Adams said. As a result, the department is “not doing routine inspections” of Medicare and Medicaid certifications, but is still able to respond to complaints and questions, he said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mom-and-child-stock-GettyImages-1339053707-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:57:21.293207

“We can ask for more donations of food, but we have no guarantee those donations will come,” Bott added.

Utah’s Department of Workforce Services, which manages the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in the state announced Wednesday that November payments will not be made because of the government shutdown. 
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams said the state “is not equipped to fund federal programs for weeks or months in the absence of congressional action.” The stalemate is now in its 23rd day. 
Some Utahns enrolled in SNAP receive payment on the 11th or 15th of every month. Others get theirs on the 5th, meaning they’ll feel the effects in less than two weeks.  
The amount varies, depending on a household’s net income. For a family of four, the maximum monthly allotment is about $1,000; for an individual, the cap is just under $300. 
Across Utah’s 29 counties, the food bank distributes to 309 local agencies. All have limited resources, Bott said.

“They don’t have a lot of storage space, they don’t have a lot of refrigeration. Many of them are staffed by volunteers,” Bott said. 
Some pantries may have to reduce the number of times people can visit every month, she said, which will impose extra challenges for Utahns living far from grocery and big box stores. 
“Not only is it incredibly frustrating, it’s incredibly sad,” Bott said. 
As need increases, the nonprofit Switchpoint’s two pantries in St. George and Tooele may have to transition from clients choosing their own groceries to receiving prepackaged boxes in an effort to better ration donated items, said Switchpoint spokesperson Zachary Almaguer. 
“We will do everything in our power not to turn individuals away,” Almaguer added, noting the organization also operates kitchens serving free meals in both cities.
“We’re watching closely, we are concerned, but we’re doing our best not to listen to what might be or what could be, but we’re planning for what we know we can do,” Almaguer said. 
For Bott, the pause in benefits reminds her in some ways of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many Utahns were suddenly out of work and visited food pantries to get by.
Asked if her organization can fill the need next month, she said no one entity can do it alone. She noted churches and faith-based organizations in the state also accept and distribute grocery donations. 
Said Bott: “It’s going to take all of us coming together to be able to make the best situation that we possibly can for people.”

Ron DeSantis, Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, and Jenell Flynn, a Jacksonville resident, hosted a rountable discussion on property taxes in Jacksonville on May 9, 2025. (Screenshot via governor's X livestream)A week after Republican members of the Florida House offered seven proposed constitutional amendments to address property tax reform on the 2026 ballot, Gov. Ron DeSantis has dismissed all of them, saying they reflect a lack of seriousness from the chamber.
“Placing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,” DeSantis said in his first comments since the proposals were unveiled in a message on his X account on Wednesday night. “It’s a political game, not a serious attempt to get it done for the people.”
In dismissing the proposals so cavalierly, the governor indicated he is still willing to play hardball with House Republicans, with whom he feuded often during the regular 2025 legislative session earlier this year.
In explaining the various proposals, House Speaker Daniel Perez said in a memo last week that it was his position that “the House does not need to limit itself in presenting one plan, but instead allow the people of Florida the ability to choose some, all, or none of the proposals on the 2026 ballot.”
All of the proposals filed last week exempted the portion of property taxes that fund K-12 schools, and they all had language specifically prohibiting local governments from reducing funding for law enforcement. Property taxes comprise around 46% of school funding, according to the Florida Education Association.
Senate President Ben Albritton still has not commented on the House proposals, which were filed as resolutions. They would need to be approved by three-fifths of each chamber to make it on the statewide ballot, where they must get 60% support for passage.
“Stay tuned,” the governor added on social media about what comes next in this discussion.
DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia have been on the campaign trail for months insisting that Floridians need property tax relief, promising they will get the chance to vote on such a proposal in the form of a constitutional amendment on the 2026 November ballot.
Ingoglia and his team of auditors inside the CFO’s office have traveled throughout the state to highlight what he claims is excessive spending by local governments. The events seem intended to preempt arguments by local governments that to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes would pose an existential threat to essential services such as police protection, firefighter services, roads, and parks.
In the case of the City of Tampa for example, Mayor Jane Castor’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget shows that every dollar of Tampa’s $380 million in property tax revenue is allocated to police and fire services.
Meanwhile, Ingoglia took his campaign promoting the yet-to-be written constitutional amendment to Miami Thursday.
The CFO said that the city had “excessively” spent $94 million over the amount that would account for population and inflation in its general fund budget in the 2024-25 fiscal year. He added that going back to the 2019-20 fiscal year, the general fund budget had increased by $358 million in five years.
“If this was a business, the City of Miami would go bankrupt,” he said, declaring that elected officials in the city had engaged in fiscal irresponsibility.
When asked by a reporter if he was essentially “big footing” local communities by questioning the spending priorities of elected officials who were voted in by the public, Ingoglia said he thought it was “highly suspect” that people were “voting for priorities for wasteful and excessive spending.”
He then acknowleged that it would “up to the taxpayers” to decide what they want to do with the information his office is providing in the press conferences he is conducting.
The Phoenix reached out to Miami Mayor Francis Suarez office for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.

The mayor listed a few avenues for funding, such as increasing tax diversions from the Capital City Improvement District or increasing the city’s one-percent sales tax. The latter, though, may put local businesses in a tough position, he added. 
JXN Water’s funding shortfall includes funds for debt payments. The utility warned in September that if it can’t make debt payments, the state would have to start diverting some of the city’s sales tax revenue. Horhn confirmed that was the case, but said Jackson was able to pay the $5 million owed by December. It’s unclear how much longer the city would be able to cover those payments without additional water funding.

The mayor went on to address what happens to the city’s water and sewer systems, which are both under the control of JXN Water, after the third-party manager steps aside. Horhn said he wants control of the systems to return to the city, and laid out a plan for an independent advisory board to run them separately from Jackson’s public works department.
His vision of the advisory board includes a majority of appointees from the Jackson mayor’s office. Because the city serves places outside of Jackson, such as Ridgeland and Byram, Horhn said a minority of appointees could come from the state or from those other municipalities. The board would then hire a third-party company to manage and operate the utilities. 
Rep. Shanda Yates, a Republican from Jackson and the committee’s chairwoman, asked how Horhn’s plan would differ from lawmakers’ past attempts to put the city’s utilities under a separate utility authority. Those plans, the mayor said, gave the state a majority control. Moreover, a bill last year from Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, would have taken away Jackson’s ownership of the systems. 
The governor would have likely vetoed Parker’s bill because it would have made the state responsible for Jackson’s debts, added Horhn, who served in the state Senate at the time.

Ted Henifin, who runs JXN Water, was invited to speak at Thursday’s hearing but couldn’t attend because of a “traveling conflict,” Yates said. 
Both the mayor and Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat whose district includes part of Jackson, criticized JXN Water over its handling of billing issues. The utility, for instance, doesn’t have a process to challenge bill amounts, Horhn said, adding his proposal would include an “appeals judge” to handle such cases.
“I have 10 constituents that have reached out to me in the last 24 hours with $37,000 water bills, $70,000 water bills, and they’ve all been told that it’s due to a leak,” Nelson said. “Every last one of them has had plumbers verify that it’s not a leak.”
Adding to the challenges, the utility doesn’t have anyone who customers can talk with in-person about billing issues, and constituents are having trouble getting answers through JXN Water’s phone helpline, he said.

“I have a lot of questions, but these are mainly geared toward JXN Water, which did not show up today,” Nelson went on to say. “This has to stop. We have people whose water is being turned off every single day.”
JXN Water told Mississippi Today earlier this month that it was shutting off about 1,000 accounts per week over nonpayment.
Yates said she would coordinate another time to bring Henifin before the committee. The chairwoman asked Horhn about a Jackson City Council vote earlier this month, which approved a resolution asking U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate to place control of the water and sewer systems back under the city. Council members echoed similar concerns from residents about communicating with the utility.
Wingate, though, has the ultimate say about when to turn over management of the systems, the mayor said. Henifin has projected he’ll be the third-party manager until 2027.
JXN Water is still awaiting a decision from the judge, who appointed Henifin to his role in 2022, regarding a proposed rate increase the utility first requested in April. The current water bill rates, even with perfect collections, wouldn’t be enough to fund operations and pay for the system’s debt, Henifin has said. The collection rate is now about 70%.
In a statement after Thursday’s hearing, the utility said it had told lawmakers ahead of time that Henifin couldn’t attend.
“The creation of JXN Water itself was born out of a period when collaboration and coordination around solutions for Jackson’s water system were lacking,” the statement said. “We welcome any dialogue aimed at strengthening the system for the people of Jackson and ensuring that future governance structures are grounded in transparency, accountability, and apolitical leadership.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27124544/3X0A3389.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:18:11.560227

Bishop William Barber speaks to a crowd outside the N.C. General Assembly on Oct. 23, 2025. (Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline)Civil rights attorneys announced plans Thursday to challenge North Carolina’s newly drawn congressional districts, arguing the Republican-led map is designed to weaken Black voting power in the state’s northeast.
Lawyers with the nonprofit firm Forward Justice, speaking at a press conference in front of the General Assembly building in Raleigh, said they will file a legal challenge targeting changes to the 1st congressional district, a predominantly rural region that has elected a Black representative since 1992.
“These maps will erode the voting rights advances achieved over decades in the Black Belt region. The new maps dismantle a district that is over 40% Black, and it has consistently elected a Black representative,” said Kathleen Roblez, senior voting rights counsel at Forward Justice.
The legislature this week finalized new congressional district lines designed to create an additional Republican seat.
Republicans drew the new congressional district boundaries at the behest of President Donald Trump, who is looking to prevent Democrats from taking a majority in the U.S. House after next year’s midterm elections.
The new plan will bring the state congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and four Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats.
Critics of the new plan claim that it violates the federal Voting Rights Act by preventing Black voters from electing the candidate of their choice.
Republican legislators denied that claim, and maintained they did not use racial data in crafting the new plan. They said they believe the new map will be upheld by the courts.
US Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) narrowly won reelection to a second term last year.
The district as legislators created it for the 2024 election is the subject of an ongoing federal lawsuit. A three-judge panel is deciding whether the 1st District, other congressional districts, and state Senate districts dilute Black voting power.
Speaking at the event, Rev. William Barber, founder of Repairers of the Breach, called the redistricting “political robbery.”
“It is a boldfaced lie when they say that they don’t know what this is doing to Black voters and poor voters,” Barber said. “They know exactly what they’re doing. It’s the data that they use to make these decisions.”
Barber framed the changes as a continuation of efforts to suppress Black political participation in eastern North Carolina. “This effort is racist,” he said. “This is a direct attack on the state’s Black Belt district and marginalized community.”
Neither Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) nor House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) immediately responded to a request for comment.
Ashley Mitchell, an attorney with Forward Justice, said the new maps follow years of efforts to limit voter participation in North Carolina, including voter ID requirements, attempts to shorten early voting, restrictions on voter registration, and attacks on absentee ballots.
“This most likely will not be the last attempt to silence voters, especially Black voters across the state, though this devastating attack had intentions of silencing us,” Mitchell said.” We are not going to sit back. We are going to fight back.”
Forward Justice attorneys declined to disclose the details of their legal strategy.
Even though Republicans have said race played no role in redrawing the district, Barber said that racial intent must be judged by a policy’s consequences, not just the language used to justify it. “You look at the impact, and what they have done will directly impact the Black Belt of North Carolina,” he said.
The attorneys said they will provide more details at a community meeting on Nov. 2 in Wilson.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-23 17:01:11.653288

Sam Douglass, the now-former state senator from Orleans County, submitted his official resignation Wednesday following countrywide backlash to leaked, hateful comments he and others made in a national Young Republicans group chat.
Douglass’ letter of resignation mirrored a statement he released last week apologizing for the “offense” his comments caused and describing nasty messages he’d received since news of his involvement first broke.  
Gov. Phil Scott will appoint a replacement for Douglass, though the timeline for that process is unknown.

Douglass did not respond to a request for comment. 
A Politico story last week revealed remarks Young Republican leaders, including Douglass and his wife, Brianna Douglass, made in a Telegram group chat. According to the report, Douglass said that an Indian woman wasn’t actually Indian, “She just didn’t bathe often.” The story quoted Brianna characterizing Jews as dishonest.
The Politico exposé included members of the Young Republicans chat referring to rape as “epic” and expressing “love” for Hitler, in addition to a slew of other racist and homophobic comments.
Douglass faced immediate calls for his resignation from across the political spectrum that only escalated in the days that followed. 
Amid that cacophony, an online fundraiser purportedly created by Douglass is seeking to raise $30,000 to support his family. On the webpage, Douglass wrote that he was “targeted by a coordinated media and political barrage that purposefully took my words out of context and colluded to remove me from all my positions, fire us both from our jobs, and slander our reputation.”
Jennifer Stratton, the CEO of Lamoille County Mental Health Services, where Douglass was previously employed, confirmed that he no longer works at the organization. 
As of Monday, Douglass remained chair of the Orleans County Republican Committee, which will help develop a list of potential Senate replacements to submit to the governor. 
On Thursday, Anya Tynio, the committee’s vice chair, declined to comment on whether Douglass remained in his leadership position. She said the county Republican committee planned to hold a meeting Oct. 30, and she said she’d share a statement at that time.

(Alison Miller/MNS)WASHINGTON — Hamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib forcefully defended past comments and years of social media activity during intense questioning by lawmakers at his confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait on Thursday.
Ghalib faced scrutiny from eight members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations over his past statements on conflicts in the Middle East, including the war in Gaza. His nomination hearing was postponed in September after criticism from several groups committed to fighting antisemitism, including the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and StopAntisemitism.
Ranking Member Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told Ghalib, “I have grave concerns about some of the statements that you have made, particularly those that seem to justify the October 7th attack against Israel.”
Shaheen referenced quotes from Ghalib’s “hometown news outlet.” The Hamtramck Review reported in May that at a pro-Palestinian rally in 2023, Ghalib allegedly “justified Palestinian violence against Israel for its brutality against Palestinians, and denied that sexual violence happened against Israelis when Hamas militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7.”
Ghalib said he “totally condemn[s] what happened on October 7th.” He also said some of his statements were taken out of context and claimed the “media was biased in translating.”
Despite Ghalib’s reassurances, senators from both parties said they would not support his nomination, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who said he was “concerned that [Ghalib’s] stated public positions are markedly in conflict with the views of President Trump and with the positions of the United States.”
Ghalib replied, “I wouldn’t go against the President and his policies.”
Other Republican senators also said they’re worried Ghalib’s perspectives on the Middle East will contradict the messages the Trump administration hopes to convey overseas.
Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Penn.) and Cruz questioned Ghalib about allegedly liking a social media post comparing Jewish people to monkeys.
Ghalib called his previous social media activity, including his tendency to like every comment underneath his posts, a “bad habit.” He also said many of his controversial posts were made while he was a “private citizen,” before he was elected Hamtramck Mayor in 2021.
Multiple senators also referenced a post in which Ghalib allegedly called Saddam Hussein, the former leader of Iraq, a “martyr.” Ghalib said he made the post “in a moment of anger” after Iran launched missile strikes aimed at U.S. troops in Iraq in response to the U.S. killing of top Iranian general Quassem Suleimani in January 2020.
“As a private citizen, it is fine for you to have those views,” Sen. Shaheen said. “But it is very different when you are an ambassador representing the United States of America, particularly in a country that Saddam Hussein invaded.”
“I complimented Saddam because he kept Iran in check,” Ghalib said, “and probably that’s the only positive thing he did in his life.”
Ghalib, a Democrat and immigrant from Yemen, endorsed Trump for president and campaigned with him in Hamtramck in October 2024. Trump credited the Hamtramck mayor with helping him win Michigan and nominated Ghalib for the ambassador role in March.

Ghalib is the third Michigander appointed to a diplomatic position in the Middle East by the Trump administration this year. Bill Bazzi, former mayor of Dearborn Heights, was confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia this month. This week, Trump also appointed Mark Savaya, owner of Leaf and Bud dispensaries throughout southeast Michigan, as the U.S. special envoy to Iraq.
According to Ghalib, the president personally reaffirmed his commitment to the nominee earlier in the month following criticism from several groups. 
“President Trump has just called me and emphasized his unwavering support to me to serve as the next Ambassador of the United States to the state of Kuwait, and he thanked our community for their support,” Ghalib wrote in a Facebook post.
Ghalib’s confirmation could take weeks or even months. Ghalib must receive a majority of votes from the committee before his nomination can be voted on by the full Senate. It is unclear when that will take place.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/23/electric-boat-crystal-mall-expansion-southeastern-ct/,"Electric Boat will convert the mall into a facility for 3,000 to 5,000 staff in engineering, training, software development and other roles.","Nuclear submarine manufacturer General Dynamics Electric Boat announced Thursday that it is acquiring the majority of the largely vacant Crystal Mall in Waterford. 
The acquisition comes a few months after Electric Boat purchased the mall’s former Macy’s location. The company now owns most of the mall, with a former Sears location being the only exception. 
Speaking to reporters and a small crowd of community members outside the mall Thursday, Electric Boat President Mark Rayha said the property will be renovated, with groundbreaking expected in mid-2026. 
Once complete, the company expects to move engineering, training, software development and other support staff into the building. Somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 workers are expected to use the property, which is estimated to open in 2027. 
Submarine production, including that of Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines, will continue at the company’s Groton facility, roughly five miles away from the mall.
Rayha said the mall acquisition will bring economic benefits to both Electric Boat and the Southeastern Connecticut region. “You build a mall in a location where you can track a lot of people from a lot of areas,” he said. “So doing this here is a great opportunity.”
Local officials echoed the sentiment, saying the company’s expansion would boost the region’s status as hub in the submarine supply chain. 
“We are repurposing a regional destination into a dynamic engine of opportunity again,“ said Waterford First Selectman Rob Brule. 
‘Malls… going the way of the dodo’
Officials hope the redevelopment will breathe new life into the mall property, which has been on a decline. When the Crystal Mall was listed for sale in 2023, the property was said to be 64% full. By September of this year, just around 25% of the mall was still in use, according to CT Insider.  
Keeping stores open has been a struggle for malls across the country, as the rise of online commerce reduced foot traffic and sales. As a result, malls have become popular sites for redevelopment projects, both in Connecticut and nationwide.

Many of these projects have involved transforming properties into public gathering spaces, mixed-use developments, entertainment hubs or housing. The Electric Boat acquisition is different, instead revamping the large property for use by a single company — specifically, a manufacturer. 
Still, state officials said the move, which comes as Electric Boat continues a streak of acquisition and expansion in Southeastern Connecticut, is a smart one. 
“Malls across the state and across the country are falling a little out of favor. They’re going the way of the dodo,” said Gov. Ned Lamont. “And you’ve got to figure out how you repurpose and make sense of this. This will be hundreds of thousands of square feet of space to make sure that our submarine fleet stays the very best in the world.”
Electric Boat has grown significantly over the past few years, and the company’s rapid expansion has spurred calls for more parking and housing space in the areas near its Groton production facility, which has brought on thousands of new workers. 
That hiring shows little sign of slowing down. Rayha said the company is expected to hire close to 500 workers before the end of 2025 with an additional 2,000 hires expected in 2026. When the Crystal Mall facility does come online, it will house both current workers and new employees.
The mall, officials and company leaders said, is the perfect place to support that growth. 
“The demand and the need for more space, more parking — which, again, is also a big issue in Groton — fits perfectly with the Crystal Mall as a solution,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District. “It really just solves so many problems for what is going to be a huge era in terms of the industrial base growth.” 
For thriving shops, ‘a real kick in the gut’
Converting a mall to a large defense industrial facility requires some creative thinking. Electric Boat leaders said they expect standalone restaurants near the mall to continue operating with little change. And the mall’s exterior will largely be maintained, according to Rayha. 
“If you work at Electric Boat and this has been your mall for a number of years, you’ll be able to notice the uniqueness of the mall even when you’re working in it as an engineer,” Rayha said. 
But other details are less clear. There are still open stores in Crystal Mall, which raised questions about exactly what will happen to those businesses when Electric Boat begins renovations next year. 
Aed Powell, a manager at Toy Vault, a collectibles and toy store that has operated out of the mall for more than a decade, said he wondered what might become of his store and other mall tenants. Powell has managed the Crystal Mall location since late spring. On Thursday, he told reporters that while officials framed the mall as in dire need of help, his store is performing well. 
“I have staff who love to be here. I have staff who love to work here, who are excited to come in day after day,” he said in an interview after the morning press conference. 
Powell has had little time to process the announcement, only finding out Wednesday evening. The news of the acquisition was hard to swallow in the moment. “It’s a real kick in the gut,” he said, noting that the defense contractor’s expansion shouldn’t come at the expense of other local workers. 
For now, Powell expects his store to remain open until he is told otherwise. After the press conference, city officials and business groups passed him their cards, hoping to connect and offer assistance.
With the redevelopment project still taking shape, local officials said the change will be a net positive to the area. 
“For decades, the Crystal Mall served as a hub of commerce and connection,” Brule said. “Now, through this remarkable redevelopment, it will once again serve the region, this time as a center for innovation, skilled jobs and continued economic growth.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1023_MN_CrystalMall_014-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:01:11.653288

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma is losing out on millions in sports betting revenue to other states and illegal operators, a Senate panel was told Thursday.
Sports betting is legal in 39 states, creates about 2 million jobs and has about a $325 billion dollar impact, said Frank Sizemore, who is with the Sports Betting Alliance, which is made up of five companies.
His comments were made during a Senate interim study by Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City, that brought many of the key players together, including an executive with the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team. Lawmakers often use those studies to help craft legislation.
“Sports betting is happening now in the state,” Sizemore said. “It is just on illegal platforms and with bookies down the street.”
Illegal markets have no taxes, accountability or regulation, Sizemore said.
“Weakening the illegal market strengthens the legal one,” he said.
States that allow sports betting tax it at an average of about 16%, Sizemore said.
When states have high taxes, those who bet stay in the illegal market, he said.
For years, Oklahoma lawmakers have unsuccessfully sought to legalize sports betting, but faced obstacles, such as setting up a system that complies with gaming compacts that give tribes exclusive rights in exchange for fees. 
The tribes pay the state between 4% and 10% of adjusted gross revenue, said Matthew Morgan, Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association chairman. The organization represents 25 of the 35 tribal governments that offer gaming.

The 35 tribal nations operate more than 130 gaming facilities, according to the association.
In fiscal year 2025, Oklahoma collected over $221 million in tribal exclusivity fees, a 5% increase over the prior year, according to the Oklahoma Gaming Compliance Unit Annual Report.
“The state made a promise,” Morgan said, adding that it agreed to protect the tribes’ substantial exclusivity to operate gaming in exchange for a share fees. He said that over the life of the compacts, tribes have paid over $2.2 billion to the state.
Failure to comply with the compacts could result in monetary damages against the state, Morgan said.
Morgan said only the Oklahoma Lottery and tribes are authorized to conduct gaming in the state.
“Any breakdown in the gaming compacts would create major uncertainty for both the casino industry in Oklahoma, a major economic driver for both the tribes and the state, leading to legal challenges, legal costs that threaten the operational stability of the casinos,” said Rep. Ken Luttrell, R-Ponca City.

Luttrell and Coleman have both worked to legalize sports betting.
Will Syring, Oklahoma City Thunder vice president of corporate partnerships, said legislative efforts to legalize sport betting would have to be done within the boundaries of the gaming compacts.
Syring said the Oklahoma City Thunder is seeking 0.25% of total bets.
“Because in other markets, teams are getting a direct license,” he said. “If they’re getting licenses, they’re getting paid off those bets. The league also only allows you to take a percentage off of the top.”
Diversification of revenue streams allow the NBA organization to be competitive, he said. 
“It’s not just hot dogs and foam fingers and tickets and sponsorships,” he said. 
Sports betting would elevate fan engagement, he said. 
“We have 20 million social media followers, so when we do something, people listen,” Syring said. “When we announce a new product or a player move, people hear about it because they are following our feeds.”
When sports betting is legalized, the organization can use its “megaphone” to tell followers how to legally and safely bet through the existing compacting process, he said.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia’s public employees would see their health insurance costs increase yet again next year under a proposal outlined Thursday.
The finance board of the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency on Thursday proposed the following increases for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July:

For state employees: a 3% aggregate premium increase for employees and employers, a $200 increase in the average family’s spousal surcharge, and a $2.50 increase of the employer administrative fee.
For non-state employees, a 3% aggregate premium increase for employers and employees. The administrative fee would increase by $2.50. Non-state employers would also be required to have at least 50% of their employees enrolled in a PEIA health plan. 
For both Medicare and non-Medicare retirees, a 3% premium increase. PEIA would also designate $30 million of fiscal year 2025 investment gain for the retiree premium stabilization reserve.

More details on the proposed increases are available in the board presentation from Thursday. 
The proposal comes after state workers employees have seen health insurance increases over the last few years. 
In July, PEIA premiums went up by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs also went up. The agency also raised premiums by 12% for retirees.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Speaking to the finance board Thursday, PEIA director Brent Wolfingbarger pointed out that 96.7% of PEIA revenue goes to PEIA claim payments and capitation, and the agency has low overhead. 
He referenced a report from the firm BDO that indicated that the sharp rate increases that public workers have had in recent years had been caused in large part because between the years 2018- 2022, rates had been frozen.
“If you look at that graph, you can see that there’s a much sharper, steep curve at the end of the period where we were required to increase premiums because we had failed to keep pace with rising premium levels,” he said, pointing to a presentation. 
He also noted that PEIA is required by law to charge a spousal surcharge equal to the total actuarial value of the plan for PEIA spouses who have the option of health insurance through an employer but choose to enroll in a PEIA plan.
“Our agency is obligated to estimate what the actuarial value of the health care expenses that our employee spouses will incur, and pass that on to the employees,” he said. “That is not something that we have discretion over. It is something that is an obligation established for us in the code.”
Dale Lee, president of Education West Virginia, a teachers’ union, pointed out that public employees are not to blame for premiums being stagnant from 2018 and 2022. Gov. Jim Justice had pledged to keep rates flat. 
“It was the governor at that time saying that increases will not happen on his watch,” Lee said. “And that necessitated then in 2021 a 24.5% premium increase on employees. And I would much rather have small increments along the way than to have no increases [and] all of a sudden, a huge increase. So while that’s an accurate statement, it wasn’t our fault.”
Lee said he would push lawmakers to make the spousal surcharge based on a percentage rather than a flat fee.  
“Because the custodian, making $22,000 a year, whose spouse works at Go-Mart, is paid a much higher percentage on the spousal surcharge than the superintendent of a county, making $180,000 a year,” Lee said. 
He added that the Legislature, not the finance board, is responsible for improving PEIA. 
“I’m trying to deflect early some of the anger that’s going to be at the finance board at these public hearings,” Lee said. “Because changes can be made, but you all don’t have the ability to make those changes. You have to deal with what you’re given. The ability to make the changes comes from the Legislature. And if we want to express concern or anger or frustration, that’s where we need to express that.”
The increases for retirees are equal to about $4 million, which the Legislature could “easily” find to prevent a cost increase, Lee said. 
The PEIA board finance is planning public hearings about the rate increases across the state in November. They are scheduled for 6 p.m. on the following dates:

The Highlands Event Center in Wheeling on Nov. 3
The Beckley-Raleigh Convention Center on Nov. 6 
Holiday Inn in Martinsburg on Nov. 10
The Culture Center in Charleston on Nov. 13
Virtual meeting via Google Meet on Nov. 20

Registration for each meeting will begin at 5:30 p.m. More information on the public hearings is available at the PEIA website. 
The board is expected to vote on the proposals at its meeting Dec. 4.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, a vocal opponent, drove more than four hours from her home district to learn more about the facility than has been shared with Democratic lawmakers. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen announced Thursday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspectors have certified a Nebraska state prison to begin receiving federal detainees as it becomes a migrant detention facility.
Pillen said ICE inspectors completed a final walkthrough of the former McCook Work Ethic Camp this week, and the timeline for the first detainees to come to Nebraska is still being coordinated. Pillen said getting the final pieces together had been “a moving target” with the federal shutdown now on day 23.
“Given the many tasks that had to be completed, including the transfer of remaining inmates, building modifications, training of staff and other components, we have made significant progress,” Pillen said in a statement.

Final security upgrades will continue in McCook “over the next day or so,” Pillen said, and additional modifications will allow the facility to house up to 300 detainees, from a maximum of about 200.
Pillen’s update comes less than 24 hours before a Red Willow County District Court judge will hear arguments on a lawsuit seeking to temporarily stop the Nebraska-ICE partnership. The lawsuit is from 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln. It argues the Nebraska-ICE contract is unconstitutional without legislative approval because of language they say delegates management of the state’s prisons to the Legislature.
The lawsuit also argues that lawmakers had specified and funded the purpose of the McCook facility in law. The detention center remains state-owned and operated.
Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, are named in the lawsuit.
Attorney General’s Office arguments
Nebraska signed contract with ICE on Sept. 30 to turn state prison into migrant detention center

The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, on behalf of Pillen and Jeffreys in court filings this week, asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed and all but said the train has left the station. 
“Should the court void the state’s contract with the federal government, that would release the federal government from its obligations to compensate the state for this work. Taxpayers would therefore suffer a greater injury from preliminary relief than without it,” the brief states. “Not to mention the damage that preliminary relief would do to the state’s relationship with the federal government.”
Under the contract, ICE plans to pay Nebraska around $2.5 million monthly. Pillen’s office estimates the deal could net Nebraska $14.25 million annually. The contract was not publicly available until Oct. 17. It was signed Sept. 30. Pillen announced the initial plan Aug. 19. The lawsuit was filed Oct. 15.
The AG’s Office said the Legislature “broadly” delegated the day-to-day operations of state facilities to the executive branch and said the contract doesn’t change McCook’s “overarching purpose” as a detention center, so “any change is one of degree, not kind.”
Pillen’s office defends 17-day delay in releasing Nebraska-ICE detention contract

State attorneys said the McCook residents and Schimek are not best-suited to challenge the facility, suggesting a more proper lawsuit could come instead from the Legislature, state inmates transferred from the Work Ethic Camp to other state facilities or federal detainees. The AG’s Office said a better “check” on separation of powers concerns is the Legislature and the political process, not by going through the courts or by “random taxpayers.”
“Taxpayers who object to the defendants’ actions have the same remedy as any other Nebraskan: the ballot box,” the AG’s Office wrote.
‘Every state is a border state’
Nick Grandgenett, an attorney for the McCook residents and Schimek, framed the case last week as “not about immigration” but “our constitutional republican form of government.”
The AG’s Office criticized the lawsuit for not including all “indispensable parties” — the U.S. government, as well as a fencing company contracted to build a razor wire around the facility.
“Plaintiffs cannot use purportedly illegal expenditures related to the McCook facility — costs that the federal government will reimburse — as a bootstrap to obtain the standing necessary to present their real challenge, which is aimed at the entire cooperative agreements and federal immigration enforcement activity,” the state’s attorneys wrote.
Jeffreys, in a Thursday statement, said his department’s “attention to detail” at the Work Ethic Camp and a strong partnership and cooperation with ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security made certification possible.
“Passing these inspections is a testament to our team’s commitment to safety, security and professionalism,” Jeffreys said. He signed the initial two-year Nebraska-ICE contract Sept. 30 for the state.
Pillen said that once operational, the rebranded “Cornhusker Clink” will regionally support ICE officials “who are working tirelessly to identify illegal criminals and get them off our streets.”
“Every state is a border state,” Pillen said. “Nebraska is going to do its part to make sure that our nation and Nebraskans are safe and secure.”

Members of the House Regulatory Reform Committee discussed but did not amend or advance House Bill House 5104, Bill 5105, House Bill 5106 and House Bill 5107.
Derek Sova, a policy and legislative assistant for the Cannabis Regulatory Agency, told the committee previously that Michigan’s legal marijuana industry faced several challenges, and that two of those big hurdles were large illicit grow operations and the agency’s inability to go after bad actors because their licenses had expired.
The series of bills before the committee would address those concerns.
House Bill 5105 and House Bill 5107 are sponsored by state Reps. Pauline Wendzel (R-Watervliet) and Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), respectively. The bills would in tandem create new penalties for cultivating, delivering and processing black market marijuana, but also change the amount of marijuana a person is legally allowed to possess in plant and concentrate form.
The bills are tie-barred together, meaning both would have to jointly clear the Legislature and be signed by the governor to become law.
Under Wendzel’s bill, a person would be guilty of a misdemeanor if they possess between 10 and 25 kilograms, or between 50 and 100 plants, or between one and 2.5 kilograms of marijuana concentrate. The penalty would change to up to one year in jail or a $20,000 fine, or both.
Keeping between 25 and 125 kilograms, or between 100 and 500 plants, or between 2.5 and 12.5 kilograms of marijuana concentrate would become a felony punishable by two years in prison or a $500,000 fine, or both.
It would also be a felony offense to:

Keep between 125 and 250 kilograms, or between 500 and 1,000 plants, or between 12.5 and 25 kilograms. That could net a person four years in prison or a $2 million fine or both; and
Keep 250 kilograms or more, or 1,000 plants or more, or 25 kilograms or more of marijuana concentrate. The punishment there would be up to 10 years in prison or a $10 million fine, or both.

Sponsored by state Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids), House Bill 5104 would allow the Cannabis Regulatory Agency to sanction a person even if they are no longer a licensee or if they are no longer operating a marijuana facility.
At present, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act holds that the expiration of a state-issued license terminates the authority of the agency to impose sanctions. The bill from Grant would retain that position but would add that the authority to impose sanctions would continue if there was already a pending action against a former licensee or facility operator.
War of words continues over who greenlit Michigan wholesale pot tax: Brinks or Hall?

House Bill 5106, sponsored by state Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd), would amend the state’s Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act to similarly address disciplinary action on recreational licenses. The bill would let the agency summarily suspend a license if the licensee’s conduct poses a risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
Much like House Bill 5104, Neyer’s legislation would also give the agency authority to take disciplinary action against a person who no longer holds a license or if their license has recently expired.
The risks that could lead to license suspension or discipline, as outlined in the bill, include possessing marijuana from a source that cannot be determined, keeping marijuana stashes obtained in violation of the act, obstructing an agency investigation, and failing to provide the agency with required records.
Neyer’s bill affects growers, processors, retailers, microbusinesses, safety compliance facilities and secure transporters.
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) said they were concerned about upticks in enforcement given that some industry folk were previously on the negative end of marijuana enforcement when it was illegal in Michigan. She questioned whether it was right to increase enforcement when the state was actively beginning to tax marijuana sales at a higher rate, which some have warned will ultimately push consumers to the black market.
Sova said that the point of the package was to support the licensed industry, as much as possible, especially those following the rules.
“That’s the purpose of giving us the greater enforcement authority over the bad actors in the licensed space who are cheating, who are undermining the folks who are trying to do it the right way,” Sova said. “This has been an issue, I believe, in communities where you’ve had a lot of these large illicit outdoor growers. You’re talking sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of plants that, the way the statutes are set up right now, there’s really no disincentive to continue doing that.”
Sova added that Michigan has “become, in a lot of ways, sort of a central location for illicit operations, because the penalties for illicit activity are so low here.”
State Rep. Joseph Aragona (R-Clinton Township), the committee’s chair, said he agreed with Dievendorf.
“The 24% tax was difficult,” he said. “We obviously did not want to do in the House, but this could definitely help those legal growers who are going to be paying it, because, if I’m mistaken, the black market won’t be paying that tax.”
Sova said that was certainly the intention of the pending legislation.
Hoadley also testified along with Iosco County Prosecutor Jim Bacarella and Branch County Prosecutor Zach Stempien, both of whom supported the legislation and expressed concern for those working in the industry. Some of that concern had to deal with the exploitation of migrant workers or foreign nationals, which were issues brought up by the prosecutors during testimony.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced on Thursday she had granted a pardon request for Lue Yang, a Hmong refugee and president of the Hmong Family Association of Lansing who was detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in July over a decades-old criminal conviction.
Yang was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, and came to the U.S. in 1979 as his parents fled Laos due to war and persecution for their support of the United States during the Vietnam War. In 1997, Yang was convicted on a home burglary charge, accepting a plea bargain and served a 10-month sentence. 
In 2018, Yang’s conviction was expunged, however, the federal government does not recognize the expungement. Yang’s conviction complicated his immigration status, and he has been denied while applying for citizenship, State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), explained in a video advocating for Yang’s release. On July 15, Yang was detained by ICE while at work, and he has remained in custody since. 
“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning. 

Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record. 
Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night. 
However, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, which has been working with Yang’s attorney, told the Michigan Advance that, to the best of their knowledge, Yang remains in the U.S., noting that the lack of transparency from ICE leaves family members lawyers and advocates to cobble together his location. 
Xiong, who was also a Hmong refugee, has strongly advocated for Yang’s return. Xiong said she was extremely grateful for the pardon, noting that his family is still facing difficulties in navigating the legal system to have him released. 
“I’m grateful for that pardon from the Governor, because that means that [Yang] will have an opportunity to fight for his release, yes, but we can only do that if he is still on U.S. soil or in U.S. air,” Xiong said.
Yang’s attorney is working to vacate his case through the county court system, Xiong said.

Rising Voices, a nonprofit organization focusing on increasing civic participation among Michigan’s Asian American residents, cheered the decision in a statement while addressing the urgent action to keep Yang in the U.S. 
“My family and I need Lue to return home where he belongs. This pardon shows the power of humanity and community,” Ann Vue, Yang’s wife said in a statement. “So many people stood with us, checked in on us, and refused to allow us to give up. We applaud and thank Governor Whitmer for her courage in granting Lue this pardon. Now we demand ICE and [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] to bring Lue home to Michigan.”
On Thursday morning, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) spoke out on the Senate floor about the deportation of several Hmong and Lao men, sharing the story of Khone Segmany, who like Yang, committed a low-level offense as a young man,  as well as another man named Khamsay.
“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home. They are members of our community, they are fathers, and their families deserve to have them by their side,” Chang said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

The MBTA alone reported more than 600 assaults last year, including 33 assaults with weapons, 72 physical assaults and batteries, and 38 assaults and batteries with bodily fluids, Rep. Michael Day said as he introduced the bill (H 4645) that emerged from the Judiciary Committee he chairs.
The bill adds transit workers to the list of employees covered under the state law that imposes heightened penalties for assault and battery against public employees. It also makes clear that use of a bodily substance like saliva is covered under the assault charge. Rep. Joseph McGonagle of Everett, who sponsored the bill, said he’s seen the “injuries, scars and invisible wounds” of dozens of transit workers who were harmed on the job.
“I’ve met with workers who have been stabbed, threatened with firearms, spit on, and much more,” he said. “I’ve heard from a worker who has been left paralyzed and permanently disabled from one of these assaults.”
Under the House bill, which now goes to the Senate for consideration, offenders would face a sentence ranging from 90 days to two and a half years in a house of correction, a fine of between $500 and $5,000, or both. The head of the union that represents many MBTA operators said it hopes to see the Senate pass the same bill.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Two days after stepping down as chair of the state’s Cannabis Control Commission amid speculation she’d run for higher office, Kim Ahern made it official: She is running to be Rhode Island’s next attorney general.
Ahern on Thursday announced she had filed paperwork to join the Democratic primary to succeed Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose second and final term as the state’s top prosecutor ends after 2026. 
“Our fundamental rights are under attack, and we need an attorney general who will fight back,” she said in a statement.
Ahern, a former special assistant attorney general, said the ongoing legal battles with the Trump administration are deeply personal to her — pointing to the need to protect the legality of her marriage to her wife, Jenna, and to ensure their three daughters grow up with the same freedoms she has.
“The stakes are too high to sit on the sidelines,” she said.
Her campaign statement was issued by Josh Block, who is the spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s campaign. Ahern’s website is “going up in the next day or so,” Block said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
A Providence resident, Ahern is a graduate of Providence College and Roger Williams University School of Law. She was a clerk for Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg. 
From 2010 through 2019, Ahern served as a special assistant AG under three attorneys general: Neronha, Peter Kilmartin, and Patrick Lynch. She then went on to serve as deputy counsel for former Gov. Gina Raimondo and went on to become the deputy chief of staff for Gov. Dan McKee.
Ahern most recently served as the head of the three-member Cannabis Control Commission, a position she held since the panel’s inception by the state in 2023. As chair, she has helped craft the inaugural set of regulations governing Rhode Island’s budding recreational industry and oversaw the launch of applications for the state’s available 24 retail licenses.
She left her $204,069-a-year post Tuesday, one day after setting the timeline for regulators to review applications at the start of 2026, with the intention to start issuing new licenses by next May.
After stepping down as the state’s top pot regulator, Ahern now jumps into a race that included two other Democrats who have announced their intent to run in the 2026 AG primary: State Rep. Jason Knight of Barrington and Keith Hoffmann of Providence, who worked as the chief of policy and senior counsel under Neronha.
State Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was the first to announce a bid for AG, but exited four days later after past allegations of domestic violence were brought to light.
Charles Calenda, who ran unsuccessfully against Neronha in 2022, posted to X on Oct. 17 that he was exploring another bid for the Republican nomination.
Knight had $90,419 in his campaign account as of the most recent filing from the end of June. Hoffmann’s campaign announced Oct. 6 that his account has raised $210,000 since he entered the race.
Ahern filed “initial notice of organization” papers with the Rhode Island Board of Elections to create her campaign account Wednesday. No contributions have yet been reported.
Third quarter filings, which date from July 1 through Sept. 30 are due to state election officials at the end of the month. Fourth quarter reports, which range from Oct. 1 through the end of 2025, are due Feb. 2, 2026.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s new chief of public schools said changes could be coming to the controversial academic standards for social studies that the state passed earlier this year.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields said Thursday he intends to restart the process of reviewing the social studies standards, obtaining public input, and presenting a draft to the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature for approval. Typically updated every six years, academic standards are a lengthy list of topics that Oklahoma public schools must teach to students at each grade level.
Oklahoma already adopted new social studies standards this year under Fields’ predecessor, Ryan Walters, but they faced significant criticism over the last-minute addition of dubious content and for their inclusion of Bible teachings. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has blocked schools from implementing Walters’ social studies standards while two lawsuits are pending over them. 
Fields said his administration will ask the Court to extend that pause through the rest of the current school year, leaving state officials time to review the standards and potentially make rewrites.
“I think there will be some changes to them, yes,” Fields told news reporters Thursday after an Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting.
The board voted unanimously during the meeting to start a 60-day review period for “consideration and possible further action” on the social studies standards.
Fields said he believes the Court’s decision to pause the standards enables his administration and the board to make potential changes, even though the board and the Legislature already approved Walters’ version.

Walters’ standards claim there were “discrepancies” in the results of the 2020 presidential election between former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, whom Walters had endorsed. Walters said he didn’t intend to support or deny the 2020 election results, though his standards appeared to connect to Trump’s unverified claims of election fraud.
The former state superintendent, who resigned Sept. 30 to lead a conservative teacher organization, also added a claim that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab. The origin of the virus has not been determined, according to the World Health Organization.
Half of the state Board of Education members at the time said they had no idea the new language had been included until after they voted to approve Walters’ standards. Walters and his staff did not point out the new content before the board took a vote, and the Education Department didn’t publicly post the updated standards until weeks later.
Multiple lawsuits contend this violated state transparency laws and would enable misinformation to be taught in schools. The standards’ requirement that public schools teach students Bible stories also faces a legal challenge.
“I think we need to look at all of the things that were added to see if they’re germane to what kids need to learn,” said Fields, whom the governor appointed to finish Walters’ term.

,DC,2025-10-23 19:45:15+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump press secretary defends White House ballroom project amid East Wing teardown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-press-secretary-defends-white-house-ballroom-project-amid-east-wing-teardown,,"WASHINGTON — Workers this week demolished the East Wing of the White House, originally built in 1942, to make room for construction of a ballroom that President Donald Trump had said wouldn’t impact the building. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the roughly $300 million project during a Thursday briefing, saying it is the next in a long line of additions and renovations to the campus that have taken place throughout the country’s history. “Just trust the process,” Leavitt said. “This is going to be a magnificent addition to the White House for many years to come and it’s not costing the taxpayers anything.”The project is being fully financed by Trump and several private donors, including Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Comcast Corporation, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Union Pacific Railroad, investors Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, among others. Photos from The Associated Press appeared to show the demolition, which was first reported Monday, complete.Leavitt said tearing down the East Wing did not need approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, according to a legal opinion from that organization, an executive-branch agency responsible for managing federal construction projects in and around Washington, D.C. “Their general counsel has said when it comes to phase one of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that,” Leavitt said. “Only for vertical construction will a submission be required and that’s a legal opinion from them and we are following that legal opinion.”Design modifiedTrump said in late July that construction of the ballroom “won't interfere with the current building” and ballparked the price at $200 million.  “It will be near it but not touching it. And pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,” Trump said at the time. “It's my favorite. It's my favorite place. I love it.”Leavitt, when pressed Thursday why the president didn’t tell Americans he would need to demolish the entire East Wing, said designs were modified throughout the process. “The plans changed when the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies, who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this phase one that we’re now in was necessary,” Leavitt said.She didn’t offer an explanation for why the price had increased by $100 million, repeatedly saying no taxpayer money would go toward the ballroom. Security plans, official name unknownLeavitt declined to say whether the project will include upgrades to the bunker that sits below the East Wing, known as the president’s emergency operations center, citing security concerns. “Like any security enhancements that are made on the White House grounds, those will be made and maintained by the United States Secret Service,” she said. Trump is also deciding what exactly to name the new ballroom, though Leavitt declined to detail what he’s considering.  “There will be an official name,” she said. “I will let the president announce that once he firmly decides on it.”Trump is not currently considering any other major construction or renovation projects on the White House grounds, though Leavitt didn’t rule out that could happen during the remainder of his term, which will last until Jan. 20, 2029. “Not to my knowledge, no,” Leavitt said. “But he is a builder at heart, clearly. And so his heart and his mind is always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds. But at this point in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president’s main priority.” Call for preservationThe nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sent a letter earlier this week urging an immediate halt to demolition of the East Wing “until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”President and CEO Carol Quillen wrote the 90,000-square-foot ballroom could easily dwarf the 55,000-square-foot White House. “As we approach the 250th Anniversary of our country’s founding, the preservation of historic places that represent our nation’s history has never been more relevant or important,” Quillen wrote. “We urge you to take into account the deep reverence that all Americans hold for this iconic place, and to initiate the review process that can ensure the preservation of the historic White House for future generations.”The National Capital Planning Commission could not be reached for comment Thursday since it is closed due to the ongoing government shutdown. The Commission of Fine Arts did not immediately return a request for comment. The White House Historical Association writes on its website that the East Wing was constructed in 1942 “to house additional staff and offices, reflecting the growing complexity of the federal government during World War II.” “The East Wing’s construction was highly controversial due to its timing during wartime,” the website states. “Congressional Republicans labeled the expenditure as wasteful, with some accusing (President Franklin D.) Roosevelt of using the project to bolster his presidency’s image. The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions. However, the East Wing’s utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics.”",,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

The Minneapolis contract calls for Zencity to design a digital survey to measure community perception of the MPD and public safety. It then analyzes the response data to ‘improve’ police-community relations. Zencity presents itself as a partner of municipalities and law enforcement. 
When not using digital surveys, Zencity says it helps customers by gathering and analyzing millions of data points from the social media and internet activity of residents.
Whether through millions of collected data points or digital survey responses, Zencity says it enables law enforcement to hear from the entire community, not just the small number of people that show up at community meetings.
I see this as slick, sophisticated marketing — because the reality is very different.   
I believe that the Minneapolis Police Department should not be allowed to partner with a company like Zencity whose surveillance technology has its roots in Israel’s notorious military intelligence unit, Unit 8200, in which Eyal Feder-Levy, the founder of Zencity, served. 
Israel’s all-encompassing surveillance of Palestinians has led to the development of facial recognition, cell phone hacking and AI-powered technology that is now spilling into non-military use. 
The long-standing partnership between U.S. police and the Israeli military, which, until the current ceasefire, was carrying out a genocide, has created a backwash of violence and brutality into our Black and Indigenous communities.  
Zencity’s surveillance technology has been used by police departments throughout the U.S. to surveil social media during protests for racial justice, and monitor criticism of police and community outrage over police killings of Black people. 
MPD should not be allowed to partner with a company whose surveillance technology could easily be a tool of  racist law enforcement, especially given MPD’s own history of brutality and violence against those same communities.
Without that context, the Minneapolis contract with Zencity seems innocuous, as it is limited to online surveys. But Zencity uses existing digital advertising networks, like Meta, Google and X, to target digital advertisements to the local community. I object to police use of those ad algorithms on privacy grounds, based as they are on people’s social media and internet activity.  
Although Minneapolis is not currently using it, Zencity markets a product called “Organic” and a program called “Organic for Social Listening.” There’s no survey you decide whether or not to take — it’s a surveillance technology that law enforcement can use to collect millions of data points from social media platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, Nextdoor and LinkedIn.  
Zencity then uses its advanced artificial intelligence capability “to surface important trends, sentiment, interactions, and summaries… This feature ensures that critical changes in community sentiment or conversation volume are quickly noticed.” In other words, it can analyze the data it collected without people’s knowledge and determine what you are posting about and what your opinions might be on any topic that law enforcement wants to zero in on.
I believe both the current and potential future use of Zencity by MPD pose a threat to the online privacy of Minneapolis residents. Beyond that, even the city’s selection of an Israeli company that is associated with apartheid Israel, a state found by the International Court of Justice to be committing a “’plausible’ genocide” in Gaza, I find to be unacceptable.
Like all Israeli companies it has benefited from the occupation and the apartheid system that provides resources and connections for Israeli high tech startups while denying the same to Palestinians.
As of October of 2025, survey results posted on the mayor’s dashboard show that Black and Indigenous residents feel significantly less safe than their white counterparts. Nor is there any improvement in those scores from the prior year. For anyone familiar with Minneapolis, this is not exactly earthshaking news.
I believe the $500,000 should have been used to address the real issues faced by residents of Minneapolis — housing, infrastructure, child care and health care. Instead it is being squandered on MPD’s “community perception” surveys. The residents of Minneapolis need a real solution to MPD’s history of racist and violent policing. Not some survey.  
The contract can be cancelled for any reason on 30 days notice. The city of Minneapolis and the MPD will have already wasted $350,000 — but we can still save $150,000 taxpayer dollars if the City Council and the Mayor act by December 1.
The City Council can demand that this contract be cut — immediately. But it is only Frey who has the authority to do so.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2213769363-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

(Courtesy of WDTC)South Dakota’s four technical colleges continue to see increased enrollment in both full-time and dual credit programs, according to the 2025 fall enrollment report.
The state Board of Technical Education reviewed the report during its online meeting on Thursday.
Total enrollment increased 367 over last year, or 5%, with 7,774 students enrolled either as full-time or dual credit students (high-schoolers can take dual credit courses for high school and college credit). Jenna Reis, policy and data analyst for the board, said the increase is a “strong indicator that outreach and program investments on campuses are paying off.”


That increase contrasts with a fall enrollment report for South Dakota public universities with flat enrollment system-wide. The university system’s dual credit enrollment increased by 167, or just above 3%, with 5,335 students enrolled this year, said South Dakota Board of Regents spokeswoman Shuree Mortenson. 
Dual credit enrollment at technical colleges grew by 127 students, up to 1,474 — a 9.4% increase. 
At Lake Area Technical College in Watertown, dual credit enrollment includes more than 500 students from 78 South Dakota high schools, and 11 seniors are attending full-time, according to a news release from the school.


Health services remain the most popular programs at technical colleges, while agriculture, information technology and manufacturing all decreased in system-wide enrollment — by 62, 50 and 29, respectively.
Those decreased enrollments could be attributed to economic factors, especially regarding agriculture, board members and college presidents suggested. Trade policies, especially tariff discussions with China, continue to impact prices and profitability for farmers after a high crop production season in the state.
For Lake Area — the only college where information technology program enrollment increased — President Tiffany Sanderson credited the increase to a business and information technology partnership with Dakota State University, which specializes in computer science and information technology fields.
The partnership allows students to “climb the education ladder seamlessly from Watertown to Madison” in those fields, she said.
The other technical colleges are in Sioux Falls, Mitchell and Rapid City.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/western_dakota_technical_institute_cover-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

Delaware’s ninth straight rate reduction highlights a continuing success story in controlling costs for businesses.
DOVER, Del. (Oct. 23, 2025) — Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro on Thursday announced that workers’ compensation insurance rates will decrease for the ninth consecutive year, effective Dec. 1, marking another win for businesses but raising questions about the long-term effects of how those savings are achieved.
The Delaware Compensation Rating Bureau’s latest filing, confirmed by independent actuaries and approved after a public hearing, calls for an average loss-cost reduction of 11.6 percent in the voluntary market and 9.08 percent in the residual market, often considered the insurer of last resort. Actual savings will vary by policy.
“For nearly ten years, my administration has been able to approve rate decreases that help local businesses, and can attract new companies and jobs to Delaware,” Navarro said. “Delaware’s businesses used to pay some of the highest workers’ compensation premiums in the country, but bold policy changes have been successful in addressing that problem.”
Workers’ compensation insurance covers medical treatment and wage replacement for employees injured on the job. The new rates do not reduce benefits paid to workers but are expected to lower premiums for employers statewide.
Delaware Still Above National Average
Despite nine straight annual decreases, Delaware’s rates remain about 6 percent higher than the national average, ranking the state as the 23rd most expensive for coverage according to a national insurance tracking firm ( Workers Compensation Rates in Delaware). Just three years ago, Delaware ranked 7th, indicating substantial improvement but still lagging behind many peers.
Rates are set through data collected by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), which reviews claims, payroll, and class-code data before recommending rates to the Delaware Department of Insurance. Insurers can apply credits or debits up to 25 percent based on each employer’s safety record and claims history.
Safety Programs and Savings
At the end of 2024, 932 employers participated in the department’s Workplace Safety Program, saving nearly $4.9 million through inspections and compliance measures. Businesses can apply for the program up to seven months before policy renewal.
Policy Roots and Unintended Consequences
Observers credit Delaware’s steady decline in premiums largely to House Bill 373, a 2014 reform that capped medical reimbursement rates for workers’ compensation cases. The law aimed to control costs and stabilize the insurance market, and many agree it succeeded in lowering premiums.
But critics warn that the law may have side effects.
“It’s good news that prices are going down—that helps many businesses right now,” said Charles Copeland of the Caesar Rodney Institute. “But it’s also important to ask how the prices went down. The 2014 law limits how much doctors and hospitals get paid for workers’ comp treatment. That probably played a big part in driving rates lower year after year. The concern is that if reimbursements stay too low, some doctors may stop taking these cases—leading to longer wait times or forcing injured workers to travel farther for care.”
While no statewide data yet tracks treatment delays, Copeland and others say policymakers should monitor access issues closely to ensure savings for employers do not come at the expense of timely care for employees.
The Bottom Line
Delaware’s ninth straight rate reduction highlights a continuing success story in controlling costs for businesses. Yet with rates still above the national average—and questions about how sustainable the savings model is—stakeholders agree the next challenge is balance: keeping premiums affordable while maintaining fair compensation and access to care for injured workers.

Editor’s Fact Box: How HB 373 Changed Workers’ Comp in Delaware
What It Is:House Bill 373, enacted in 2014, overhauled Delaware’s workers’ compensation medical fee schedule. It capped how much doctors, hospitals, and clinics can be reimbursed for treating work-related injuries.
Why It Was Passed:In the early 2010s, Delaware ranked among the top five most expensive states for workers’ compensation. Lawmakers sought to curb rapidly rising medical costs, which made up more than 60% of claims expenses at the time.
What It Did:


Tied reimbursements to Medicare rates plus a fixed percentage markup.


Required the Department of Labor to update fee schedules regularly.


Established medical cost containment committees and billing review procedures.


Results:


Workers’ comp insurance premiums have fallen for nine straight years.


Delaware dropped from 7th to 23rd most expensive state for coverage.


Concerns:


Some doctors and specialists say low reimbursements make it harder to justify accepting workers’ comp patients.


Possible delays in care or limited treatment options could emerge over time.


In Summary:HB 373 helped reduce costs for businesses but may be creating new access challenges for injured workers—a trade-off that could shape future legislative debate.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Workers-Comp-Insurance-Rates.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who recommended Meredith for the federal bench, released a statement Thursday congratulating him. “Chad’s impressive legal background in the private sector and devotion to serving the public make him an excellent addition to the federal bench. His thoughtfulness and commitment to our Constitution will serve him well as he carries out his new duties.”
The son of state Sen. Stephen Merdith, R-Leitchfield, Chad Meredith is a partner in the international law firm Squire Patton Boggs, working in its Cincinnati office..
Meredith served in the Republican administrations of Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, 
Meredith’s chance to be nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022 was tanked by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican. Biden abandoned his plans to nominate Meredith after Paul vowed to block his confirmation in the Senate.
This time Paul supported Meredith, the Associated Press has reported. The Senate approved Meredith’s appointment Thursday by unanimous consent.
Meredith served as Kentucky’s solicitor general from 2019 to 2021 when Cameron was attorney general and before that as chief deputy counsel in Bevin’s administration.
As part of Bevin’s legal team, Meredith was involved in decisions about hundreds of controversial criminal pardons and commutations Bevin issued after losing reelection to Democrat Andy Beshear in 2019. Among those pardoned was a man convicted of reckless homicide during a robbery whose family had held a fundraiser for Bevin. 
In his prior roles, Meredith also defended laws and policies restricting abortion, a record that drew loud objections from Democrats when Biden considered nominating him.

The lawsuit, which was filed Thursday, accuses Missouri lawmakers of trying to trick voters by writing an intentionally deceptive summary that includes three provisions that already are part of state law, such as a ban on foreign campaign contributions. 
The first three bullet points of the summary make no mention of the proposal’s main purpose, which is to require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by voters to obtain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts to pass.
Currently, constitutional amendments only require a simple majority statewide. 
“The General Assembly elected to include these provisions in bullet points one, two, and three to conceal the central purpose,” the lawsuit states, “which is to limit citizens’ ability to approve citizen-led initiative petitions to amend the constitution.”
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

The proposed ballot measure, which was approved by state lawmakers last month, “impacts a fundamental right,” the lawsuit says. “Voters must be notified that the measure will repeal this existing right.”
If approved by voters next year, the initiative petition changes would allow a small percentage of the state’s voters to defeat any ballot measure. During last year’s general election, 311,915 votes were cast in the 1st District out of the state’s 2,960,266 votes. So 156,000 voters — or about 5.3% of the statewide vote — could prevent a measure from passing.
Only citizen-led initiative petitions would be affected. Amendments placed on the ballot by state lawmakers are not included in the change. 
The lawsuit argues the ballot summary fails to inform voters that “their votes would be counted differently, based upon the congressional district in which they live.”
Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot. 
Through recent ballot measures, Missourians have legalized abortion and recreational use of marijuana and voted to increase the minimum wage and mandate paid-sick leave. In November, the abortion-rights amendment passed with just shy of 52% of the vote with large support from the state’s urban, more-populated areas. Voters in all but eight of Missouri’s 115 counties opposed the amendment.
Republicans have argued for years that the process is dominated by out-of-state, liberal interest groups. The proposed constitutional amendment was approved by lawmakers alongside a separate bill that gerrymandered Missouri’s congressional map. 
It will appear on the statewide ballot next year.
The Missouri Realtors have vowed to oppose the changes to the initiative petition process. And the group has proven it will spend big to convince voters. 
In 2010, the Realtors raised $4.4 million to amend the Missouri Constitution to prohibit sales taxes on real estate transfers. That was followed in 2016 by a $5.6 million campaign to prevent lawmakers from extending the sales tax to services.
“The citizen initiative process is a power Missouri voters approved for themselves more than a century ago, which our association has been able to use to fight for Missouri homeowners and families,” Bobbi Howe, current president of Missouri Realtors, said in a press release. “We are committed to protecting the rights and the availability of this important tool for everyone.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/080624_Vote1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:16:57.731491

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/Maine Morning Star)With federal immigration enforcement actions picking up in cities across the country, a coalition of groups in Maine is launching a hotline to protect immigrant families from potential harassment and detention.
“The Maine ICE Watch Hotline is a lifeline for families, a bridge for neighbors and a promise that no one in our community will face fear alone,” said Portland at-large city councilor Pious Ali, speaking at a press event at City Hall Thursday.
The goal of the project, which is organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice, is to provide accurate, real-time information about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.
“This isn’t about panic — it’s about protection,” Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine said. “It’s about staying informed, connected and ready to act together. When ICE shows up, we show up too — not with fear but with solidarity. This hotline is a step towards the community we all deserve, one rooted in trust, care and collective defense.”
The hotline has already trained over 150 volunteers, both as operators to receive calls as well as verifiers to confirm or refute reported sightings of immigrant enforcement activity, Cron said. While there are already volunteers across the state, Cron said they are seeking more in rural areas.

Federal actions targeting Democratic-led cities and states have been on the rise. The press conference was held two days after 50 federal agents descended on New York City’s Canal Street, reportedly arresting nine men.
Last month, a Portland resident was detained by ICE agents after dropping off their child at the Gerald E. Talbot Community School. Nationally, schools, like workplaces, have become frequent targets and there is research tying the raids to increased student absences. 
Wes Pelletier said at the press event that, as councilor for Portland District 2, he represents some of the city’s more diverse neighborhoods and has “seen firsthand how fear has taken hold of our communities. Truancy is on the rise… our parks and playgrounds and our streets are more quiet.”
Pelletier, who is among the volunteers that have taken the verifier training, said over the past few months there’s been quiet organizing but there’s been a growing need for a “unified network to share information that doesn’t cause undo panic, is integrated in the communities it serves, and that balances safety with accessibility.”
After the hotline receives a call of a potential sighting, the report is passed to a regional verifier response group. If they confirm that immigration agents are present, an alert will go out through texts and social media. Verifiers are also trained to observe enforcement actions and gather more information. Afterwards, the hotline will help track the detainee through the immigration system while connecting impacted people with legal representation, financial and other support.
Similar grassroots efforts have been launched elsewhere to protect immigrant communities and push back against federal enforcement actions.
Ahead of the Trump administration’s deployment of immigration authorities last month to Chicago, community groups similarly launched a hotline to help keep tabs on agent activity. Since then, volunteers have organized a vast rapid response network that includes blowing whistles to alert neighbors if ICE or Border Patrol agents are spotted nearby and documenting encounters with federal agents on their phones.  
Cron said they’ve connected with and learned from groups in other states, including Siembra NC, in North Carolina, and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network in Massachusetts.
The role of local law enforcement
While the speakers focused on federal immigration activity, enforcement in Maine has routinely been initiated by local law enforcement.
Since March, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 22 minor traffic stops and similar incidents where more than 50 Maine residents and workers were handed over to immigration officials by state and local law enforcement based on suspected immigration status alone. This is not a complete picture of such incidents, but rather the organization’s best estimate based on verifiable reports.
“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” ILAP shared in a statement. 
While ICE arrests in Maine double, governor delays deciding on limits for local police cooperation

The state Legislature has considered prohibiting or restricting state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities, though both remain in limbo heading into the next session in January. One of those bills passed the Legislature and rests with Gov. Janet Mills.
“When our governor refuses to sign a bill that will prevent local and state law enforcement from being used to enforce harsh federal immigration laws, it sends the wrong message,” said Ali. “It tells the federal agencies that they can come into our neighborhoods and act without restraint.”
Cron said the hotline guidance is the same regardless of whether it is a federal or local officer and people should call in if they see any suspicious law enforcement activity.
An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities. 
As of Tuesday night, no police departments in Maine have formal agreements with federal immigration authorities, after Wells Police Department terminated its agreement under the 287(g) program.
This means departments in Maine have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.
Another layer is where immigration detainees are housed. The public has for months been calling for the board to end Cumberland County Jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshal Service to house federal detainees, which includes immigration detainees, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics. 
Earlier this week, the board postponed its decision, with some members raising concern that ending the contract would only take people farther away from their families and legal counsel. 
Legal experts say that already occurs, as it’s common practice for federal authorities to transfer immigration detainees from facility to facility. 
As Maine Morning Star reported in April, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.
The hotline is currently available from 6-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. Monday through Friday. The coalition is encouraging interested parties to volunteer or share information about the hotline on social media or by displaying one of their posters.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education on Thursday unanimously approved a request for an additional $426 million from the state Legislature for next budget year.
Regents said they will need hundreds of millions more on top of their over $1 billion current legislative allocation for deferred maintenance, workforce development programs and research projects. 
The agency’s request includes $347 million in one-time requests, $21.5 million to pay for legislative initiatives and increasing the agency’s base operating budget by $57 million, an increase of 5.5%. 
The $57 million increase to the base operating budget includes $13.5 million to meet “critical workforce” needs in education, health care and engineering. They also want $43.5 million for student success programs like scholarships, student support, campus safety and “performance-based formula allocations.”  
“Our budget request reflects continued investment to meet growing workforce needs in STEM, education and health care,” said board Chair Courtney Warmington in a statement. “Increasing college degree completion in high-demand fields remains public higher education’s top priority.” 
The $347 million in one-time requests would be for “institution-specific allocations.” 
Over $56 million of this would pay for deferred maintenance across all institutions. To address all deferred maintenance at Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities would cost the state $1.9 billion, according to the budget request. 
It also includes $68 million for both University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University for “research and capital projects,” $60 million for regional and four-year universities for workforce investments and $20 million for two-year colleges for the same purpose. 
The final $21.5 million for “legislative initiatives” includes funding for programs passed or required by the Legislature like expanding concurrent enrollment opportunities for high school students and funding financial assistance programs. 
Legislative priorities
The Regents on Thursday approved a series of their priorities for the upcoming legislative session.
One goal includes increasing the annual family income limit to qualify for the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship program, said Jarrett Jobe, vice chancellor for governmental relations. The scholarship program offers qualified Oklahoma students, based on income and academic standards, an opportunity to earn a scholarship for college tuition.
Jobe said the agency also wants to clear up definitions in the law passed last session expanding Oklahoma’s Promise to the children of educators. 
Oklahoma higher education leaders previously said lawmakers may not have allocated enough funding to meet the demand for this expansion. 
The scholarship program is expected to cost the state $88.2 million for the upcoming fiscal year, officials said. This is an increase from previous years, largely due to a longer application window, more students meeting the requirements to qualify and the Legislature expanding the program to the children of Oklahoma educators.
Stabilizing property insurance rates is another major priority, Jobe said, because insurance is increasingly contributing to more expensive operational costs for all public higher education institutions. 
“As you know, we’ve received in our budgets and relief for our system over the last few years to the $5 million to stabilize these rising costs,” he said. “(We) have met with the insurance commissioner last year and we’re trying to figure out some statewide policies to help not only higher education, but the state, to keep those down and mitigate rising costs.”
Other priorities include supporting campus research, supporting adult learners and enhancing campus security by addressing physical and cybersecurity threats.

(Getty Images)Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced Thursday that regional agencies that support the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children will be closed starting Nov. 1 if the government shutdown continues. 
The region-based WIC agencies that support all 10 New Hampshire counties — Community Action Program of Belknap-Merrimack Counties, Goodwin Community Health, Community Action Partnership Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties, and Southwestern Community Services — will close at the beginning of next month due to lack of federal funding. 
WIC is a federal program that aims to “provide free healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education, and referrals to others services” for women and their children from pregnancy to age 5. 
Despite the possibility of agencies closing their doors in November, WIC services will continue for now. On Tuesday, Ayotte announced that the state had received additional funding for WIC from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to sustain services amid the shutdown. 
“We know how important these resources are to New Hampshire families and will continue to work with our partners to ensure WIC families have access to food benefits for as long as possible until the shutdown is resolved,” the governor said in a statement. 
According to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, at least 13,000 Granite Staters will be able to sustain food benefits because of the additional funding. WIC participants can continue to receive benefits and food balances on the WIC shopper app or by calling the agency.

This finding, in conjunction with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, comes as the DeSantis administration attempts to ban vaccine mandates, including for public school students.
“This is one of the most exciting observations I have seen in my 20-year career as a cancer researcher,” Dr. Duane Mitchell, director of the UF Clinical Translational Science Institute, said in a video announcing the research.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

In early September, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced a push to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida. Ladapo attacked government mandates, saying, “Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God.”
Last month, appearing on the “On Call” podcast with Houston physician Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, Ladapo said, “The goal with the mRNA is for that not to be available to anyone, because no one should be using that one.”
Meanwhile, researchers at UF, where Ladapo is also a professor of medicine, are optimistic that mRNA vaccines will change the way cancer is treated.
“The notion that we may be able to use a simple vaccine to awaken a patient’s immune response to better fight their disease may totally change the way we think about treating cancer for the foreseeable future,” Mitchell said. 
Researchers highlight mRNA vaccines (for messenger RNA) for the way they can boost the body’s immune response, “a significant step toward a long-awaited universal cancer vaccine to boost the tumor-fighting effects of immunotherapy,” UF said in its news release. 
“The implications are extraordinary — this could revolutionize the entire field of oncologic care,” said co-senior author Dr. Elias Sayour, a UF Health pediatric oncologist. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilize and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”

Study results
The observation is based on more than 1,000 patients at the Texas facility. Although preliminary, the results could have a widespread reach if validated in a clinical trial, UF said. 
The university said the next step is a clinical trial through the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network. 
The research focused on patients with stage 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma between 2019 and 2023. 
Patients who received the COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting cancer treatment drugs were “associated with living longer by a significant amount.” Lung cancer patients with the vaccine had a median survival increase from 20.6 months to 37.3 months. Metastatic melanoma patients increased survival length from an average of 26.7 months to 30-40 months.
Non-mRNA vaccines provided no change in longevity, the research found.
“Although not yet proven to be causal, this is the type of treatment benefit that we strive for and hope to see with therapeutic interventions — but rarely do,” Mitchell said. 
The National Cancer Institute and “multiple foundations” funded the research. 
The study’s first author, Dr. Adam Grippin, trained at UF and now works at the Texas facility.
Last month, First Lady Casey DeSantis, a cancer survivor and co-chair of the Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission, announced $60 million in grants to support, in part, “research into the benefits of repurposing generics, like ivermectin, to fight cancer.”
Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, is subject of a bill in the Florida House that would allow for it to be sold over the counter. According to the National Institutes of Health, the drug is effective for treating parasites in animals, and for humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies. The FDA has not approved the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 or cancer.
“Generic medicines are often overlooked because they’re off-patent and don’t necessarily promise big profits. Florida is investing in researching them to learn more and hopefully uncover new ways to beat cancer,” she wrote on social media.
As for a statewide ban on vaccine mandates, Ladapo said that during the coming legislative session, legislators will “have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
In order to remove all vaccine mandates, lawmakers would have to change statute, although agency officials can eliminate other mandates through rulemaking

,DC,2025-10-23 18:41:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate fails to move ahead on bills extending pay to federal workers during shutdown,"Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-fails-move-ahead-bills-extending-pay-federal-workers-during-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Thursday failed to advance a Republican measure and rejected unanimous agreements on two related bills from Democrats that would have paid federal employees and contractors who have continued to work amid the government shutdown, which entered day 23. The stalemate constituted the latest example of how dug in to their arguments both parties are as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 drags out, as well as the heightened political tensions in the upper chamber when it comes to striking a deal to resume government funding.  Most federal employees will miss their first full paycheck on Friday or early next week. More than 42 million Americans, some 40% under the age of 17, are also at risk of delayed food assistance if Congress doesn’t address a funding shortfall expected by Nov. 1 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Senate Democrats Wednesday sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins over concerns that the agency has warned states to hold off on processing SNAP benefits. They contended the agency has the resources to keep payments flowing.“We were deeply disturbed to hear that the USDA has instructed states to stop processing SNAP benefits for November and were surprised by your recent comments that the program will ‘run out of money in two weeks,’” according to the letter. “In fact, the USDA has several tools available which would enable SNAP benefits to be paid through or close to the end of November.”Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill Wednesday to continue SNAP funding through the shutdown. During Thursday’s briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would “absolutely support” the legislation.Deadlock on federal worker payIn the Senate, a measure from Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson on a 54-45 vote did not reach the 60-vote threshold needed to advance in the chamber. Its failure means that federal employees who have continued to work will not be paid until the shutdown ends.Democratic senators who agreed to the measure included Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman and Georgia's Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota changed his vote in order to reconsider the measure. “I don’t think it makes sense to hold these federal workers hostage,” Warnock told States Newsroom in an interview on his vote Thursday. “If I could have a path to give some of these folks relief while fighting for health care, that’s what I decided to do.”A separate measure from Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen also failed to move forward after Johnson objected. Van Hollen requested unanimous consent to approve his bill that would have also protected federal workers from mass Reductions in Force, or RIFs, that President Donald Trump has attempted during the shutdown. A second Democratic bill, from Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., was narrower, only including pay for federal workers. But when he requested unanimous approval for his measure, it was also blocked by Johnson.Senators then left Capitol Hill for the weekend. On Wednesday, the Senate took a failed 12th vote to provide the federal government and its services with flat funding through Nov. 21.Senate Republicans have pressed Senate Democrats to approve the GOP-written stopgap measure. But Democrats have maintained that they will not support the House measure because it does not extend tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Layoffs cited by Van HollenVan Hollen argued his bill would protect workers from the president’s targeting of certain federal agencies and programs.""We certainly shouldn't set up a system where the president of the United States gets to decide what agencies to shut down, what they can open, who to pay and who not to pay, who to punish and who not to punish,"" Van Hollen said on the Senate floor before asking for unanimous consent to move the bill forward.Johnson objected to including Van Hollen's provision to ban federal worker layoffs during a shutdown. President Donald Trump’s efforts to lay off thousands of federal workers during the shutdown have been on hold since last week, after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that was later expanded.  However, Johnson said he was willing to add into his own bill the provision from Van Hollen to pay furloughed workers.""I'm more than happy to sit down with you. Maybe we should do that later today,"" Van Hollen told Johnson during their debate on the floor.Shortly after, Peters introduced a near-mirror version of Van Hollen's bill, except that his measure would not prohibit layoffs — essentially what Johnson told Van Hollen he would agree to.""We all say we agree on this, so let's just pass this bill now,"" the Michigan Democrat said before asking for unanimous consent to advance the legislation.Johnson also objected to that proposal.“It only solves a problem temporarily. We're going to be right back in the same position,” Johnson said in an interview with States Newsroom about why he rejected Peters’ proposal.  Johnson said he talked with Peters and Van Hollen after the vote and “we’ll be talking beyond this.”‘Waste of time’ for House to meetEven if the Senate passed the bill sponsored by Johnson or Van Hollen, it’s unlikely the House, which has been in recess since last month, would return to vote on either measure.At a Thursday morning press conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that Republicans already passed a stopgap measure to pay federal workers and that Senate Democrats should support that legislation. Johnson said bringing back the House would be a “waste of time,” noting that Democrats would not vote on the Republican proposal. “If I brought everybody back right now and we voted on a measure to do this, to pay essential workers, it would be spiked in the Senate,” said the Louisiana Republican. ""So it would be a waste of our time.”Duffy warns of flight delays due to shutdownTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy joined Johnson and House Republicans during their press conference. He said that flight delays have increased due to staffing shortages.More than 50,000 TSA agents and more than 13,000 air traffic controllers have continued to work without pay during the government shutdown. “They’re angry,” Duffy said of air traffic controllers. “I've gone to a number of different towers over the course of the last week to 10 days. They're frustrated.”Next Tuesday, air traffic controllers will not receive their full paycheck for their work in October, Duffy said.He added that the agency is already short-staffed — by up to 3,000 air traffic controllers.“When we have lower staffing, what happens is, you'll see delays or cancellations,” Duffy said. The FlightAware tracker said there were 2,132 delays within, into or out of the United States of unspecified length reported by Thursday afternoon, compared to 4,175 on Wednesday, 3,846 on Tuesday and 6,792 on Monday.A shortage of air traffic controllers helped play a role in ending the 2019 government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, after thousands of commercial flights were ground to a halt.",,,,2025-10-23 14:57:26.372385

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. 
President Donald Trump and his administration are increasingly criticizing the use of vaccines on children, even though vaccines have kept millions of children healthy while also improving global public health.
The focus on vaccines comes as the government monitors the biggest measles outbreak in the United States in more than 30 years and increasing cases of whooping cough and flu deaths in children.
SC offering free measles vaccines amid growing Upstate outbreak

Some of the president’s claims in recent weeks — that vaccines cause autism, or that some combination shots given to prevent multiple diseases should be separated — are not rooted in fact or science. During a Sept. 22 news conference, Trump openly speculated about why children receive so many shots.
“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies. It’s a disgrace. I don’t see it. I don’t, I think it has, I think it’s very bad,” the president said during remarks where he also warned pregnant people to avoid pain-relief medication like Tylenol, claiming that it causes autism despite no proven direct connection. “They’re pumping, it looks like they’re pumping into a horse. You have a little child, little fragile child, and you get a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess. Eighty different blends, and they pump it in.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who is playing a central role in vaccine policy gave a different estimate during a Senate hearing on Sept. 4.
“When I was a kid, I got three vaccines, I was fully compliant,” Kennedy said. “Today’s children have to get between 69 and 92 vaccines in order to be fully compliant, between maternity and 18 years.”
These figures are conflated and need context, medical experts say. Here’s what to know about the childhood vaccine schedule.
What is the childhood vaccine schedule, and why do we need one?
The childhood vaccine schedule, as it’s known in the United States, is a series of recommended vaccine shots for children that have been approved by medical professionals and the federal government. The vaccines, administered throughout childhood but primarily in the first years of life, protect children from diseases that used to be more common — like polio and diphtheria. The schedule is also used by insurance companies to determine which vaccines they will pay for.
Following the schedule is especially important for young children because their immune systems are still developing and they’re more susceptible to infection.
Before the widespread introduction of vaccines, children were infected with more diseases that caused illness, long-term chronic ailments and sometimes death. Children who follow the vaccine schedule are less likely to become seriously infected by certain diseases, and they also create herd immunity for others who are unable to be vaccinated because of compromised immune systems.
Has the schedule changed?
Yes. The medical community has recommended adding more vaccines to the schedule over time. But the science behind some vaccines — their ingredients, effectiveness and the shots necessary to complete a series — has improved.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, the trusted medical organization of pediatricians that was founded nearly 100 years ago, began making vaccine requirements in the late 1930s through a pamphlet with a red cover known as its “Red Book.” At the time, vaccines were available for only a handful of diseases: smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).
Over time, more vaccines were developed: The polio vaccine was introduced in the 1950s. Separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella were made available during the 1960s before a combination shot was introduced in the early 1970s.
During this time, doctors and researchers discussed the need for more formal vaccine guidelines. In 1964, a government-backed panel of experts, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was formed. It is housed under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For decades, AAP and ACIP issued separate but similar vaccine schedules for children. The groups, along with the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) approved a single vaccine schedule that became effective in 1995.
New shots have been added periodically to the unified schedule: The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine was added in the mid-1990s; the rotavirus vaccine was added and revised between 1998 and 2008; the hepatitis A vaccine was added in 2000; and the pneumococcal vaccine was added in 2001.
Kennedy politicized ACIP this summer by replacing all its members, and some of the new members do not have relevant experience in vaccine safety or policy. AAP, which had still been issuing standalone vaccine recommendations, is highlighting its work and not ACIP’s.
When Kennedy says he was vaccine compliant after just a handful of shots, he’s leaving out the fact that children back then got sick more often, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
This was a time before a vaccine to prevent measles, which at the time caused roughly 50,000 hospitalizations in children. Vaccination also didn’t exist for rubella, which at the time caused about 20,000 cases of congenital birth defects. Even chickenpox caused more than 10,000 hospitalizations before a vaccine was introduced.
“We live longer, better, safer lives because of those vaccines that weren’t available for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I when we were little boys in the 1950s,” Offit said.
Why are there so many vaccines on the schedule? And are there that many shots?
The vaccines listed on the current schedule help protect against more than 15 potentially serious diseases. The CDC lists each disease here.
Since some vaccines require multiple shots, that can add up. The polio vaccine requires four doses between infancy and 6 years old. The pneumococcal vaccine also has four shots in its series before age 2. The combination diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is five shots over several years.
By one estimate, children receive a little over 30 vaccine doses by the time they turn 18. That does not include annual immunization for the flu or COVID-19. People may choose to get those shots throughout adulthood.
That is more vaccines than in the past, but that is only because new vaccines have been developed to help prevent more diseases.
Dr. David Hill, a pediatrician in North Carolina and an official representative for AAP, noted the medical breakthrough of the pneumococcal vaccine that was added to the childhood vaccine schedule during his first years of practicing medicine. That vaccine helps block a serious bacteria that can cause multiple infections in the body
“It used to be that kids were in all the time with severe ear infections, sinus infections — we had to worry about those infections turning into meningitis if they got bad or were uncontrolled,” he said. “And I watched the number of ear infections that I would treat plummet, and the severity go down dramatically.”
Hill also noted the antibody shot for the respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, that is given to pregnant people or newborns and has been available for only a few years. Emerging research shows they are safe and effective.
“I can tell you that RSV was just the bane of our existence all winter long in pediatric hospital medicine,” he said. “Our floors were inundated with babies who were having difficulty breathing, and just last year these protective efforts were fully rolled out, and it’s been a dramatic difference.”
Is there a cumulative impact for a child getting so many vaccines?
No. Vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety, including alongside one another to ensure they can be administered together.
This topic is at the crux of Trump’s framing about the safety of childhood vaccines, since children sometimes receive multiple vaccine shots during early wellness check-ups. That may worry some parents about whether so many shots can overwhelm a child’s immune system. But research shows no cumulative impact on children.
Hill said parents should think about this through the lens of antigens, the part of viruses and bacteria that induce immune responses in the body. They are often the key ingredient in vaccines aimed at preparing the body for potential infection.
The number of antigens in vaccines has decreased since the 1960s. So even though children may be getting more shots than before, they’re getting less of an antigen load compared with a few decades ago.
“Say your child gets a cold, they’re getting thousands of antigens when they get that cold. If your child drops a chocolate-covered raisin on the floor and picks it up and eats it, thousands of antigens. The dog licks their face, tons of antigens. They go to day care, countless antigens,” Hill said. “The entire vaccine series today carries fewer than 300 antigens. So in terms of what the immune system is capable of responding to, it is a drop in the bucket. It is just negligible when you compare it to the number of antigens that the immune system responds to over the daily course of life.”
Offit put it another way: “It’s not the number of shots that matters. It’s the number of immunological components in those shots that matters.”
How does the United States compare to other countries when it comes to the number of vaccines that kids take?
Vaccine mandates and recommendations for children vary broadly around the world, and many are linked to school entry. While there is no global schedule standard for childhood vaccines, the World Health Organization tracks how countries aim to address the same vaccine-preventable diseases.
Some countries recommend fewer vaccine shots. The reasons vary: Access, finances, universal health care policies and vaccine manufacturers’ capacity all play a role in how governments set their policies.
Offit said one of the reasons the United States may have more vaccinations on its schedule — not just for young children, but older ones — is because it has been willing to invest in public health like supporting vaccine use.
The British government just recently began recommending the chickpox vaccine, decades after the United States and other countries.
Separately, while other countries do not recommend the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, the United States added it to its vaccine schedule for older children and teens. Rates of cervical cancer in the United States have dropped.
“Other countries choose not to do that,” Offit said. “The better question is, ‘Why don’t they do it?’ Not, ‘Why do we do it?’”
What vaccines are needed for school?
Participation in public settings like day cares and schools often include vaccine requirements (unless there is an allowable exemption) because infectious diseases can spread easily in group settings. Certain jobs also require immunization records. States have different laws and rules for vaccine mandates.
What’s the risk of delaying or skipping certain vaccines?
More than 1 in 6 children in the United States begin but do not complete all vaccines that require multiple doses. Often that is because of access to health care, but some parents also choose to ignore the recommendations or delay certain vaccines.
Doctors do not recommend that parents skip or delay shots, since vaccines on the schedule have been timed to when a child’s immune system is most susceptible to certain diseases but also when that immune system is mature enough to respond to a vaccine.
For example, ​​children are encouraged to complete the rotavirus vaccine series by six months of age because rotavirus is a common disease between six and 24 months of age.
“Children are vaccinated at certain ages because you want to make sure they’re immune and protected at a time when they would likely develop those diseases,” Offit said.
Many babies are born with maternal antibodies in their bloodstream, but that protection wanes as a child ages — which is why eliciting an infant’s own immune response is important.
“A delayed vaccine schedule only increases the period of time during which you’re susceptible to these preventable illnesses, with no benefit,” Offit added.
Do vaccines cause autism?
No, they do not. It’s a longtime debunked rumor that picked up steam in the late 1990s when a now-retracted research paper concluded that children who received the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot later developed autism — despite no robust scientific proof. Several studies since then have shown no association between vaccines and autism. The MMR vaccine is also safe and effective.
How do we know that vaccines are safe?
Vaccines are tested during multiple phases of what’s known as clinical trials. In the United States, a vaccine product must pass safety standards before it can be approved for use and made available to the public. A vaccine that’s been added to the childhood vaccine schedule continues to be monitored afterward in case its use needs to be revised.
While vaccines can cause side effects — primarily some soreness and a mild fever — doctors are more concerned with the impact of a person becoming infected with a vaccine-preventable disease. Serious side effects are extremely rare, but if someone believes they or a child were harmed by a vaccine, there is also a legal mechanism to file a claim.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2202122299-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:57:26.372385

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced a contingency plan Thursday that would partner the state with the New Hampshire Food Bank’s mobile food pantry program to help in-need families should the government shutdown prevent those families from receiving food assistance benefits.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is operated jointly by the federal and state governments to help low-income families pay for food. When Congress failed to pass a federal budget in September, the federal government ceased all nonessential operations, including SNAP. If Congress doesn’t act by Oct. 31, the federal government won’t distribute funding for SNAP benefits to states. Over 75,000 people in New Hampshire are enrolled in SNAP.
The plan, which is subject to approval by the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee and the Governor and Executive Council, will allow the food bank to open up to 20 locations twice a week for the next five weeks, just for SNAP recipients. DHHS’s announcement didn’t say whether state funding would be used but the need for Fiscal Committee and Executive Council approval suggests it will. The department has not yet responded to the Bulletin’s request for clarification.
“I want to thank our partners at the New Hampshire Food Bank for joining us in this effort to ensure vulnerable Granite Staters get the food they need in the event this shutdown continues,” Gov. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the plan. “Now, politicians in Washington must get their act together and reopen the federal government so critical programs like SNAP and WIC can continue without disruption.”
The government shutdown began after Senate Democrats refused to vote for any spending plan that didn’t include an extension of tax credits Americans use to purchase health coverage on HealthCare.gov. U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen told the Bulletin last week that “there are not any official negotiations going on” between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, only backdoor communications.
Republicans say they won’t discuss extending the tax credits until the government reopens. Democrats say they won’t vote to reopen the government until Republicans vote with them to extend the tax credits. If the tax credits aren’t extended, many Americans using HealthCare.gov will see large increases in their health care premiums.
SNAP recipients aren’t the only ones feeling the effects of the shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed while many essential workers are working without pay. Also, national parks are closed, and federally funded research projects are facing potential delays.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SNAPcontingency-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:57:26.372385

(Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)The U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted to confirm Montana state Rep. Bill Mercer as a U.S. Judge for the District of Montana.
President Donald Trump nominated the Billings Republican to the federal bench in July, and the Senate held a hearing on his nomination later that month.
Montana’s U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy released a joint statement following the 52-45 vote praising Mercer’s appointment.
“We congratulate William Mercer on his long-awaited confirmation to serve as U.S. District Judge for Montana,” the senators said. “Bill will have a lasting impact on both our state and the nation, and his experience at the U.S. Department of Justice, as U.S. Attorney for Montana, and as a state legislator have uniquely prepared him for this role. We are confident Bill will continue to zealously defend the rule of law and the original interpretation of the Constitution as he serves the people of Montana and the nation.”
The Senate vote broke along party lines, with three senators — Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) — not voting.
Mercer, 61, was born in Billings. He earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Montana, a master’s in public administration from Harvard University, and his law degree from George Mason University. Mercer has worked at Holland & Hart law firm since 2010.
Mercer was the Montana U.S. Attorney from 2001-09, during the President George W. Bush administration, and since 2019 has served in the Montana House.
He will replace current federal judge Dana Christensen, who in 2022 announced his intent to retire to senior status.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Hours after Denver Mayor Mike Johnston announced that his office had again unilaterally extended the city’s contract with Flock Safety, his staff and Denver Police Department officials faced questions from residents who say they’re angry and fearful about how the company’s network of AI-powered surveillance cameras may be used.
A standing room only crowd of hundreds packed a large conference hall and spilled into an overflow room at Geotech Environmental Equipment’s Denver facility during a town hall organized Wednesday by Denver neighborhood organizations and progressive groups including the ACLU of Colorado, which says the Flock cameras “pose a serious threat to the democratic rights of every person in our city.”
Frustrations boiled over repeatedly during the two-hour meeting, especially in relation to Johnston’s decision earlier Wednesday to extend the existing Flock contract until March 2026. That contract extension comes with new terms that are responsive to community concerns about how the citywide network of 111 license plate readers are used, said Tim Hoffman, Johnston’s director of policy, who represented the mayor’s office at the event.

“I would respectfully disagree with the idea that the mayor did not engage in any public process,” said Hoffman, a former prosecutor who ran for an at-large seat on Denver City Council in 2023, drawing howls of derision from the crowd.
Amid nationwide concerns about the use of Flock’s surveillance network to aid President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation campaign, Johnston’s defense of the cameras as a key crime-fighting tool for police has emerged as a defining issue of his first term in office. Weeks after City Council members unanimously rejected a two-year, $666,000 contract extension with Flock in May, Johnston’s office agreed to a shorter-term extension priced at $498,500 — just below the $500,000 threshold at which city contracts require council approval.
At-Large Council member Sarah Parady said in a statement that she was “stunned” by the latest contract extension, which she called an “undemocratic dealing with a known bad actor.” She answered questions at Wednesday’s town hall alongside two fellow council members, Serena Gonzalez-Gutierrez and Shontel Lewis, who also expressed concerns about Flock and the way Johnston has handled the issue.
“Just following a weekend when millions of people poured out into the streets for No Kings day protests, one man made a decision — behind a closed door, with the CEO of a private company — about a technology that threatens all of our constitutional rights,” Katie Leonard, an organizer with the Denver Party for Socialism and Liberation, told the crowd.
In a statement Wednesday, Johnston touted the extension as a “Denver-specific package that will lead the way in using this technology for the public good.” Flock will implement safeguards, the city said in a press release, to prevent the network from being accessed by federal agents or law enforcement officers from other jurisdictions, and the company has verbally agreed to pay $100,000 for each instance of data being improperly released to external parties.

Those provisions aren’t nearly enough to satisfy Flock’s critics, who say the company and the mayor’s office have repeatedly misled the public about how the system can be used. Officials had previously denied that the cameras could be used for immigration enforcement, before audit logs revealed that Denver cameras had been accessed more than 1,400 times for that express purpose. Those searches were enabled because Denver had been included in Flock’s “national lookup” function, which Denver police officials said they hadn’t been aware of and disabled after learning of it in April.
“The track record that you have does not build trust,” said Kathy Sandoval of the Villa Park neighborhood organization.
Critics also argue that data collected by Flock in Denver can’t be fully insulated from federal search warrants or other pressure from the Trump administration — or from federal agents accessing the system using the login credentials of local officers, as a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent did using a Loveland Police Department account earlier this year.
Colorado law bars local law enforcement and state agencies from collaborating with ICE or sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration authorities. But a pattern of both “front door” and “back door” access to local Flock networks by federal agents was recently revealed in Washington state, which Parady noted has immigrant protection laws similar to Colorado’s.
Between 700 and 800 Denver police officers have access to the Flock system, Commander Jake Herrera of the department’s Operational Innovation Bureau told town hall attendees.
Mass surveillance fears
Since Flock cameras were first installed in Denver in May 2024, over 250 stolen vehicles have been recovered “at least in part” due to the system, Hoffman said, and it has provided evidence leading to the arrests of nine homicide suspects.
The use of automated license plate readers like those operated by Flock has been challenged in court by civil rights advocates who argue it violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. Hoffman called it an “unsettled area of law.”

After presentations from advocates and neighborhood organizations, members of the public voiced their opposition to Flock in a Q&A session. One speaker expressed fear that the technology would be used to target transgender Denverites and other people the Trump administration may label “terrorists,” while another called himself a “normie Democrat” who felt let down by Johnston’s actions.
“I obviously hear the frustration in this room,” Hoffman said. “There are going to be disagreements on the margins here, (but) there is no one in the mayor’s administration, the mayor especially, who wants ICE rounding up our most vulnerable citizens or residents … (or) a woman who comes here from Texas for reproductive health care to then have that action be prosecuted back in the state of Texas.”
404 Media reported earlier this year that a sheriff’s deputy in Johnson County, Texas, had used Flock’s nationwide search function to surveil a woman who had an abortion. Both Flock and the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department claimed the search was performed as part of a “missing person” investigation for the woman’s safety, but court records subsequently contradicted that claim, showing the woman was under scrutiny as part of a “death investigation” of a “non-viable fetus.”
Flock’s mass surveillance technology, Parady told the crowd, is “serving the smaller and smaller circle of people who are absolutely convinced that they never have to fear their government — not because of a mistake, not because of their politics, not because they’ve gotten reproductive health care, not because they’re trans, not because they’re immigrants, not because they stood up for immigrants, not because they’re a democratic socialist elected official, not because they tried to prosecute Donald Trump.”
“If you are in that circle, perhaps this technology is serving you,” Parady added. “That circle is shrinking every day.”

Gov. Newsom was prepared to sue over a potential National Guard deployment.,"In summary
President Trump name-dropped Bay Area tech executives when he called off an immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco. Gov. Newsom was prepared to sue over a potential National Guard deployment.


After a tense night in the Bay Area, President Trump called off a planned “surge” of federal immigration agents in San Francisco after friends persuaded him to back down.
“Great people like (Nvidia president) Jensen Huang, (Salesforce chief executive) Marc Benioff and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” the president wrote on social media. “They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”
The announcement followed a nerve-wracking night for Bay Area immigrants and others. Wednesday afternoon, Trump deployed about 100 federal agents to a military base in the East Bay in preparation for a high-profile and long-threatened immigration crackdown.
Agents were expected to raid local Home Depot stores, where undocumented workers often congregate, over the next few days, local news outlets reported. 
“We’re going to go to San Francisco,” Trump told a Fox News reporter on Sunday. “The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.”
Protesters throughout the Bay Area began amassing on Thursday, starting with a pre-dawn gathering blocking the entrance to Coast Guard Island in Alameda, where the federal agents were expected to arrive. Agents deployed an apparent flash-bang grenade to disperse the crowd, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Elsewhere, protesters planned to gather at San Jose City Hall, San Francisco’s Justin Herman Plaza and other locations.
San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said on social media that Trump called him Wednesday night.
“I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise,” Lurie wrote. “We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery. 
“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie continued. “Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning.”
State and local authorities had been anticipating the raids and had stern words for the Trump administration and vowed to take action to protect residents.
“We’re a nation of laws and accountability — not a nation that turns a blind eye to abuse of power,” Newsom said in a statement. “We don’t bow to kings, and we’re standing up to this wannabe tyrant. The notion that the federal government can deploy troops into our cities with no justification grounded in reality, no oversight, no accountability, no respect for state sovereignty — it’s a direct assault on the rule of law.”
Newsom characterized the deployment as an attempt at voter suppression, as Californians vote on Proposition 50 to redraw congressional maps in favor of Democrats. Newsom put the measure on the ballot to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas that was meant to help Trump keep a GOP majority in the House of Representatives. Less than two weeks before Election Day, the race remains close.
Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta promised to sue the federal government to stop National Guard troops from deploying to San Francisco.  So far, the administration’s heightened presence in the Bay Area appeared limited to immigration enforcement.
“There is no basis to send National Guard troops to San Francisco. No emergency. No rebellion. No invasion. Not even unrest,” Bonta said in a statement. “Trump has made no secret of his intentions: To use our National Guard as his own Royal Army and our cities as a training ground for the military. This is outrageous, indefensible, and most importantly illegal.” 
San Francisco, Oakland and several other cities in the Bay Area are so-called sanctuary cities, which limits how  local law enforcement officers interact with federal immigration agents. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she would prosecute federal agents who used excessive force or otherwise violated local laws.
Trump has used crime data as a justification for potentially sending troops to San Francisco and other left-leaning cities. But San Francisco’s crime rate is down significantly in most categories. Oakland, which historically has had some of the country’s highest violent crime rates, has also seen a steep drop in most types of crime this year.
One of the most diverse regions in the country, the Bay Area has a robust immigrant population – roughly 30%, according to the Bay Area Equity Atlas. The majority come from Latin America and Asia, but thousands also come from Iran, Russia and Canada. At least 457,000 lack legal status, according to the Migration Policy Institute.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102325-CBP-ICE-SF-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 14:18:15.747241

Fewer headline grabbing jackpots last year led to a drop in revenue for online lottery offerings. (Screenshot from RILottery website)Rhode Island’s gaming revenue has rebounded from last year’s decline, even as most aspects of the industry have taken some financial hits. And it’s all thanks to mobile gambling, according to the latest report by the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General.
The annual report released Wednesday showed the Rhode Island Lottery transferred $433.6 million to the state’s general fund in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 — a $7.2 million increase over fiscal 2024 revenue of $426.4 million.
In fiscal 2023, the state reported $434 million in gaming revenues.
Like prior years, the bulk of last year’s gaming revenue came from video lottery terminals within the state’s two Bally’s-run casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton, which accounted for $313.6 million, or 70.8% of total gross profit. But even that stable source of gaming income saw a decrease of 0.6% from fiscal 2024, according to the auditor’s report.
The main reason gaming revenues stayed afloat, the report notes, was iGaming. Formally launched by Bally’s Corp. in March 2024, the state’s mobile casino provided a net profit of $20.8 million to Rhode Island’s general fund at the end of the fiscal year.
But the auditor’s report notes the iGaming money may not be reliable much longer.
“Massachusetts is expected to implement iLottery in the spring of 2026, as well as legislative consideration of some additional iGaming bills,” the report states.
Most other forms of gaming were on the decline in the most recent fiscal year.
The auditor general’s report notes the state’s share of table games revenue fell 2.9%, along with a 16.1% decrease in online lottery offerings. The latter was attributed to “significantly fewer large jackpot drawings” — those advertised in an excess of $1 billion — for PowerBall and Mega Millions drawings.
Revenue generated by sports wagers declined by 3.2%, with only $18.6 million transferred to the state’s general fund. In fiscal year 2024, the state received $19.2 million from sports betting.
The auditor’s report blames the decline “primarily due to increased competition from neighboring states.”
Rhode Island was the first state in New England to legalize sports wagers in 2018, but Connecticut and Massachusetts were close behind.
Connecticut, which legalized sports betting in 2021, saw nearly $28 million in revenue from bets in the most recent fiscal year, according to data from the state’s Department of Consumer Protection.
Massachusetts, which launched sports betting in 2023, saw over $150 million in gaming revenue, according to data from the commonwealth’s Gaming Commission.
Lawmakers have tried to make sports betting more appealing in Rhode Island in recent years as a way to recapture bets that have since gone to neighboring states. In 2023, the state legalized bets on collegiate teams when they are participating in tournaments consisting of four or more teams.
Some also tried to expand the number of online sports betting vendors beyond the single app managed by International Game Technology, which has the state’s exclusive contract to run Rhode Island’s digital sportsbook through November 2026.
Legislation introduced this year sought to expand the number of sports betting vendors to between three and five  by July 2026. A bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone cleared the Senate during the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, but never reached the House floor. 
Rhode Island gambling regulators are in the midst of laying the groundwork to possibly expand online sports betting options — though there is some skepticism about how much money an expanded market would bring.

Mike Bohacek, of Michiana Shores, was stopped by Michigan City Police on Jan. 24 and later found to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.28% — more than three times Indiana’s legal limit of 0.08%. (Michigan City Police)New body camera footage released by Michigan City police shows what unfolded the night Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek was stopped and ultimately driven home — rather than booked into jail — after a January traffic stop that later led to his drunk driving arrest.
The roughly two-hour video, obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle through a public records request, provides a full account of the stop. A request for dash cam video is still pending. 
Bohacek, of Michiana Shores, was stopped by police on Jan. 24 after a citizen reported him “drinking an open container and stumble out of his vehicle” at a Panda Express in Michigan City, according to charging documents. The senator was later pulled over near Swan Lake Cemetery on U.S. 20, where he refused a breathalyzer test. 


Police then took him to a hospital, where a blood test showed a blood alcohol content of 0.28% — more than three times Indiana’s legal limit of 0.08%.
But Bohacek wasn’t arrested at the time. Under Indiana law, members of the General Assembly are shielded from arrest in most cases during the legislative session — a protection known as legislative immunity.
That meant Bohacek’s case was kept sealed and the senator remained uncharged for months.
New details from body camera footage
The recording begins as Officer Daniel Revoir pulls over Bohacek’s Black 2023 Dodge Charger, bearing his Indiana legislative license plate.
“You were going a little above the speed limit,” Revoir tells Bohacek as he approaches the car. Officers later said Bohacek was clocked at 70 miles per hour in a 45 zone.
Revoir told another officer that Bohacek was “was maintaining his lane” while driving, but said the senator’s eyes appeared red and glassy.
When Bohacek refused to perform field sobriety tests or blow into a portable breath test, Revoir began consulting superiors about how to proceed.

“So, I just pulled over a state senator,” he says at one point, expressing uncertainty about whether he had probable cause to arrest Bohacek. Revoir additionally told a supervisor that Bohacek was “in his car, drinking water and eating food” during the traffic stop.
The officer read Indiana’s implied consent law, which warns that refusal to take a chemical test can result in a one-year license suspension. Still, Bohacek declined again.
Revoir then told dispatchers he would obtain a warrant for a blood draw. Bohacek was handcuffed, patted down and placed in the squad car, but not arrested. His wife was called to retrieve his vehicle from the roadside.
At Franciscan Health Michigan City, Bohacek consented to the blood test. 
When asked if he had been drinking or using drugs, Bohacek replied that he takes tramadol, a prescription medication, for back pain.
He then said quietly that he “had a glass of wine” at home earlier in the day.
“I didn’t eat lunch,” Bohacek said. “I don’t drink a lot, so.”
At one point, the senator admitted that he “probably should’ve used Uber Eats, or something.”
Revoir agreed: “Yeah, that definitely would’ve been a cheaper option.”
The officer later told Bohacek that test results confirmed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.28%.
“The numbers are the numbers,” Bohacek responded. Moments later, after realizing his BAC was more than three times Indiana’s legal limit, he added: “How much? … Holy — oh, wow. … That’s crazy. I didn’t expect that.”
Revoir replied: “If all you had was one glass of wine, that was a strong glass of wine.”
Allowed to go home 
The body camera footage showed Revoir repeatedly checking with superiors about what to do after learning Bohacek’s blood-alcohol level. Supervisors and a local prosecutor advised that because the General Assembly was still in session, officers could not jail him that night.
Revoir explained the decision to Bohacek at the hospital.
“I guess legally, I cannot arrest you and take you to jail because your congress is still in session. So, what I’m going to do is I’m doing a full police report, and I’m going to file an arrest warrant for you for operating while intoxicated,” he said. “Once (the legislature) is out of session, you’ll be surrendered by the Statehouse and remanded into custody.”
Bohacek said he had “no idea how this works.”
“Apparently, I can still get parking tickets,” he told Revoir. “But … I don’t speed. I don’t know how the whole immunity thing works. I’ve never been around it.”
Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek accepts plea deal in DUI case

Even so, Bohacek apologized multiple times. 
“I’m sorry,” he told Revoir as the officer drove him home. 
“You don’t seem like a bad guy,” Revoir responded. “But obviously, you know, good people make bad choices from time to time.”
Bohacek, who represents Senate District 8, was later charged in May with two misdemeanor counts: operating a vehicle while intoxicated with endangerment and operating with a BAC of 0.15% or higher. The charges came months after the Jan. 18 incident, once the legislative session had ended.
A specific section in the Indiana Constitution states that lawmakers are immune from arrest during session in all cases except treason, felony, or breach of the peace during the legislative session, as well as while traveling to and from the Indiana Statehouse. 
The most recent session started on Jan. 8 and adjourned on April 25.

(Courtesy of the Office of the Governor) A well-known face from public television this week stepped into a new role leading the New Mexico Office of African American Affairs.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Gene Grant’s appointment as the office’s executive director on Wednesday. He previously spent nearly two decades as host of “New Mexico in Focus” on the local PBS affiliate. After leaving the show in 2023, he then served as the chief program and policy officer at nonprofit Animal Protection New Mexico for just over two years. Grant, a Santa Fe resident, also serves on the boards of the ACLU of New Mexico, the Vortex Theatre and Duke City Shootout.
“For almost 20 years, Gene Grant has been one of New Mexico’s most trusted voices — asking tough questions, bringing people together and making sure every New Mexican has a seat at the table,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “He understands the power of representation, and he’s spent his career making sure African American voices and stories are front and center in our state.”
Grant’s hiring marks the third appointment since William Scott Carreathers resigned as the office’s head in June 2020. Lujan Grisham then appointed New Mexico Black Leadership Council Board President Amy Whitfield to the role. After Whitfield became the governor’s   housing and homelessness advisor, Charles Reado, a former social worker for the state’s child welfare department, stepped in as the office’s acting executive director. Reado will now serve as the department’s deputy director, Grant confirmed.
The state’s Sunshine Portal reports the executive director position has an annual salary of more than $98,0000 per year.
In an interview with Source, Grant said his first priorities will be expanding the office’s footprint; offering more information virtually; and providing listening sessions. His first day was officially Oct. 22, he said.
“I’m thankful for the governor’s confidence, and there’s a lot of work to do, and I’m ready to do it,” Grant said. “There’s issues informing the African American community that are happening out of national politics, as well as local politics that need attention in all corners of our state.”
Grant named three top issues he plans to address: physical health; mental health awareness; and education, but promised to incorporate feedback from across the state to drill down into further priorities. He said his time in public media fostered his “eye for the statewide view.”
“I’m not just an Albuquerque-specific or Santa Fe-specific person,” he said. We’re going to be getting on the road: to Hobbs, Roswell, Las Cruces, all the different counties where there are African American populations. I’ll be talking with legislators that serve in those areas.”
Grant said he also hopes to transform Albuquerque’s African American Performing Arts Center into a resource for the surrounding neighborhood in the city’s International District.
“We hope to use it for different things beyond just exhibition, beyond just stage performances,” Grant said.
He said the pressure the federal government is exerting on agencies and universities to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion inspires him to work to prove the state agency’s value to all New Mexicans.
“It’s a state agency, all taxpayers pay for it and, while we have a single focus, certainly, it is good for the rest of the state,” he said. “If we have things moving forward in the African American community, everybody wins.”
The national environment is creating a sense of urgency to protect the state office’s mission.
“It’s tough times right now, there’s no question about it,” he continued. “But it’s time to be brave, it’s a time to be forward-leaning, it’s time to look towards the future, and make sure that African Americans here have equally a shot to as many of the great things that are going on in New Mexico as everybody else.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-23 17:49:19+00:00,Mississippi Today,Charter school battle: Ambition Prep says it doesn’t need JPS approval to expand into high school,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/23/charter-school-battle-ambition-prep-says-it-doesnt-need-jps-approval-to-expand-into-high-school/,"The Jackson Public Schools board voted to deny a charter school's request to expand to high school grades, but state authorizer board approved the expansion.","The Jackson Public Schools board voted unanimously to deny a charter school’s request to expand into high school grades — but that isn’t stopping Ambition Prep’s plans, its leader said. 
The Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board approved Ambition Preparatory Charter School’s request to expand into grades nine through 12 at its July meeting. The school currently serves kindergarten through eighth-grade students. However, leaders of the local public school district voiced their disapproval at their board meeting Tuesday night.

“The establishment of this high school will have significant long-term implications, including decreased enrollment in existing high schools, particularly smaller ones, resulting in an impact on district fiscal operations,” JPS Superintendent Errick Greene said. He also noted that a new high school would likely affect teacher recruitment at the public school district. 
Greene made clear in an impassioned speech that the district views Ambition’s foray into higher grades as the establishment of a new school, not an expansion.
It’s an important distinction.
According to state law, charter schools can only be established in areas where the local school district is rated A, B or C if the local school district’s board approves. There’s no appeal process, so if the school board denies the request, the process ends. New charter schools can only be established without local school board approval in areas rated D or F. 
But expanding an existing charter school to serve more grades is relatively new territory. The Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board, which is tasked with approving new or expanded charter schools, established a new policy in 2023 that addresses charter schools that want to expand.
Lisa Karmacharya, executive director of the authorizer board, says that, in this instance, Ambition Prep is not starting a new school, so it doesn’t have to follow the state law for establishing new charter schools. 
The JPS vote came as a shock to Karmacharya when reached by Mississippi Today. 
“I am absolutely speechless,” she said. “My mouth dropped open.”
Karmacharya said that DeArchie Scott, Ambition’s executive director, completed a “healthy and robust application for the expansion” under the new policy and should continue with the process. 
That’s exactly what Scott plans to do, he said. 
“It’s not a new application, so it goes based on what the (local public school) district was rated at the time of approval, which was an ‘F,’” he said. “It’s already been approved by our authorizer board, so we don’t need approval from JPS.”
Ambition Prep, which opened in 2019, got a C in the latest Mississippi school report card, as did Jackson Public Schools. 
Clarksdale Collegiate Public Charter School in the Delta was previously approved as the state’s first charter high school, but that was through a merger. Ambition is the first school in the state to take advantage of the charter board’s new expansion policy to start serving higher grades. If the charter’s buildout is completed in fall 2027, it would make Ambition Prep the second charter high school in the state and the only charter high school in Jackson.
It’s not clear how the dispute will be resolved, or if it will escalate to litigation.
A spokesperson for Jackson Public Schools said the district’s board of trustees would “pursue all available options at its disposal to support its position regarding Ambition Prep’s request.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06211733/IMG_4139.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:02:48.411957

In an attempt to clear the air, Rogers said she’d reached out to each one of them.

Upon hearing her email, Jennifer Baughn, an architecture historian who lives down the street from Taste, in the otherwise sleepy north Fondren neighborhood off Meadowbrook Road, spoke up.
“That’s me,” she said so members of the Jackson Planning Board could hear her. “I’ve never received an email.” 
“But I have it here,” Rogers insisted as other residents began to say that they, too, had not heard from her. “I literally have it here.”
Residents in close proximity to Taste have complained for months that the establishment, which many of them refer to as a nightclub despite Rogers’ insistence it is a bar and restaurant, has disturbed their quality of life with loud music and traffic.
At issue Wednesday was Taste’s proposal to build nine residential units — which it hoped to use as Airbnbs — on top of its existing restaurant in a section of Fondren historically home to offices, convenience stores and fast-food chains. The units are part of Rogers’ plan to invest in north Jackson that began when she opened a beauty supply store in 2022 after owning a beauty business in the area for more than a decade. 
“We’re not going to invest in the neighborhood just to destroy it,” she told Mississippi Today.

To open Airbnbs, the city’s zoning administrator, Ester Ainsworth, had recommended Taste pursue rezoning its white brick restaurant, one of the few newly redone commercial buildings in this part of Fondren, from commercial to mixed-use development. 
The proposal rankled residents of the otherwise low-key neighborhood. Six people, including Baughn, spoke in opposition to what she called a “de facto entertainment district” with music that is too loud and patrons who park illegally and drive recklessly. 
“This has been the most stressful year of my life as every weekend has been taken away from us,” she said. “We cannot enjoy the peace of our household and that has happened without any due process from our neighbors.” 
After about an hour of discussion, the planning board overwhelmingly voted to recommend denying the rezoning. The issue will eventually go before the city council, which has the final say on whether or not to grant Taste’s request. 
“Thank you for your investment in the city,” said Michael Booker, the planning chairman who represents Ward 2 and voted against the measure, as Rogers and her attorneys walked out of the room. 
As they exited, they vowed aloud to build hotel rooms instead.

Terris Harris, an attorney who spoke on behalf of Rogers, told the planning board that he thought an above hotel would be permitted under the restaurant’s existing zoning classification, so Taste could pursue its goal of building the units even if the board nixed its Airbnb-apartment idea. 
“That would be well within the requirements of their zoning, so it’s tomato, tomato, chocolate, chocolate, however you want to say this, it’s the exact same thing,” he said.  
Harris added that he believed residents’ opposition to Taste’s proposal had “absolutely nothing” to do with a second floor of residential units but rather a mistaken belief that Taste operates as a nightclub when it is in fact a bar and restaurant. 
“These aren’t fly-by-night business folks,” he said. “These are business folks with multimillion dollar enterprises who have spent over a million in that place. … This is not a nightclub. That’s not what this is. This is a fine dining restaurant, and the cigar lounge they have in there is super small, so it’s not a lot of people in there.”

Rogers insisted she had done everything she could to ameliorate the concerns, such as buying parcels of land around the restaurant to create additional parking and even turning over security footage that police wanted when they investigated a shooting near a nightclub across the street from Taste called Parlour Room. The bullets injured eight people and police reportedly found at least 30 casings outside.  
“We have hired extra security guards. We have got a noise ordinance reader. We got with the police to make sure we have the exact same ordinance reader as they do,” Rogers said. “We started closing earlier. We don’t even have a DJ where we started off having a DJ.” 
Baughn and others conceded Taste is not the only bar on the street causing problems for residents. 
“It’s a different crowd,” she said of the Parlour Room. “It’s a little more criminal of a crowd than Taste, but it’s not as popular as Taste, and it has adequate parking, which Taste does not.” 
Liz Brister, the president of Downtown Jackson Partners who lives in the neighborhood and has renovated homes there, said a nonprofit organization working on Fondren’s economic development plan is looking at the need to rezone the area to encourage residential density. 
Doug Boone, the executive director of the Fondren Renaissance Foundation, claimed Taste has made no attempt to hear from residents and had, in fact, misled them about the nature of its business from the start. 
Brenda Davis, a resident who moved to North Fondren in 1989 and decided to stay there after she retired in the late 2000s, said she hears “booming bass” and “cars screeching” every weekend. 
“‘No communication’ might not be the word,” she said of the relations between the bar and residents, “but no communication between the two that would cause a compromise.” 
Ainsworth, the zoning administrator, said she had witnessed the bar’s patrons parking up and down the street, flouting No Parking signs. Emily Pote, a planning board member representing Ward 7, asked who is supposed to hold the bar responsible for that, to which Ainsworth replied, “the city.” 
“But sometimes people pay us no attention, and they do whatever they feel is necessary for their survival,” Ainsworth said. 
After the meeting, Baughn said that her street has had problems over the years with loud establishments, including a spate of rave clubs about 20 years ago that were shut down after residents got the city council and the fire marshal involved. 
Compared to the raves, Taste has the potential to be an improvement, Baughn said. 
“I love that building, and actually, what they’ve done with it isn’t bad,” she said of Rogers’ redesign. 
Baughn said she doesn’t know why bars or nightclubs have flocked to this area of town over the years, except for its excess vacant rental space. She believes the solution now is to sever the commercial and residential sides of North Fondren by closing off the street. 
“I do think there could be a compromise, she has just not been interested in it,” Baughn said of Rogers. “She could’ve talked to us today, but she didn’t.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23122519/Jackson-Planning-Board-meeting-5.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:02:48.411957

That review of the election, which did not turn up any proof of wrongdoing, has resulted in 10 counts of misconduct being filed against the former judge. Late last month, he agreed to have his law license suspended for three years because of the charges. 
Last week the OLR filed a statement arguing that the case against Gableman should follow Supreme Court precedent, which would mean the costs incurred by the OLR investigator and independent referee overseeing the case should be paid by the lawyer under investigation. The referee issued a recommendation stating that there was no reason the case shouldn’t follow the existing precedent.
Both the responsibility for paying the bill and the ultimate punishment will be decided by the state Supreme Court. 
Also last week, Gableman filed a motion in his case last week seeking the recusal of liberal justices Susan Crawford and Rebecca Dallet.
Gableman’s filing notes that Crawford called him a “disgraced election conspiracy theorist” and accused him of leading a “sham” investigation of the 2020 election during her campaign earlier this year. 
His filing notes comments Dallet made in 2017 after she had announced her campaign for the Court but before Gableman had decided not to run for another term. Dallet accused Gableman of not recusing himself from cases in which he had a conflict of interest, called his 2008 campaign “one of the most unethical” in state history and said he was a “rubber stamp for his political allies.”
Gableman argues that these comments create the appearance of bias and that the justices shouldn’t weigh in on his punishment. If they were to recuse, the Court’s conservatives would hold a 3-2 majority — though Justice Brian Hagedorn sided with the Court’s liberals in the 2020 election cases it decided.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Ranchers are pushing against a Trump administration proposal to import beef from Argentina, a move they say is causing chaos in the market. 
Beef production had been a bright spot in a struggling U.S. farm economy. But futures prices have taken a hit since President Donald Trump said Sunday that the U.S. should buy beef to help support Argentina and lower prices for consumers. 
Julie Ellingson, executive vice president of the North Dakota Stockmen’s Association, said Trump’s stance had an immediate and dramatic impact on the livestock industry. 
Ellingson called it “real time, real life consequences for livestock producers.”
Ellingson and the Stockmen’s Association say supply and demand should determine the market. 
“Our organization has stood steadfast against market-altering policies,” the group said in a statement. “Otherwise, market signals get confused and chaos can result, just like we have seen the last few days since the announcement.”
USDA announces plan to ‘strengthen’ beef industry

For ranchers, fall is a critical time of year, when cattle that have been grazed during the summer are often sold. 
Frank Tomac is the president of Independent Beef Association of North Dakota and ranches in Sioux County on the South Dakota state line. 
“If our president continues to push this, then it’s going to continue to drop our prices,” Tomac said. 
The group is calling on its members and on consumers to resist Argentine beef imports and to call for labeling rules that would indicate if beef is imported, known as a country of origin labeling. 
“The consumer could then decide which product they want, whether they want the product of the U.S., or whether they want the product of foreign countries,” Tomac said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday announced a plan to strengthen the cattle industry and lower beef prices for consumers.
The same day, Trump, in a social media post, took credit for the strength of the beef market. 
“The only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,” Trump wrote, adding that beef producers need to bring down their prices. 
Matt Perdue, the former government relations director for the North Dakota Farmers Union who now is a candidate to become president of the organization, said he was “deeply disappointed” in the comment. 
Perdue said he supports Trump administration moves to open up more public lands to grazing and encourage young producers to get into ranching, but he said importing beef undercuts U.S. producers. 
Perdue said ranchers have endured a long stretch of low prices. “There’s finally a period of some financial success, and we have to ruin that?” Perdue asked.
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., on Tuesday signed a letter to Trump along with other House members asking for clarity on the policy. 
“We respectfully request additional information on this matter and urge your administration to ensure that any future decisions are made with full transparency, sound science, and a firm commitment to the U.S. cattle industry,” the letter said. 
Ellingson said this has been a good year for beef producers. The U.S. cattle herd has shrunk in recent years, in part because of drought conditions in prime cattle-producing regions. 
That has been a driver of higher prices for ranchers and at the grocery store, but Ellingson said demand for beef has remained strong in the U.S. and in export markets. 
“This has been a real positive time in the beef business, in many cases, hitting record prices for live cattle,” Ellingson said. “Consumer demand is as strong as it’s ever been.”

Instead, Rep. Jessica Baker wants to replace every mention of “child pornography” in statute with “child sexual abuse material,” because she believes it’s wrong to apply “pornography” to pictures and videos of raped or sexually battered children.
“While adult pornography is legal, there is no legitimate category known as ‘child pornography,'” Baker, a Jacksonville Republican, said in a statement to the Phoenix. “The term itself is misleading, as it implies a lawful form of pornography when, in fact, any sexualized depiction or exploitation of minors is a crime. Such material is not pornography — it is Child Sexual Abuse Material.
“We must call it what it truly is: the documentation of the sexual abuse of children,” she added.
Jacksonville House Republican Jessica Baker at the Capitol on April 12, 2023 (photo credit: Mitch Perry)
HB 245 is a 56-page measure that crosses out every reference to “child pornography” in Florida law and replaces it with “child sexual abuse material,” amending 19 state statutes.
If passed, Baker’s bill would align Florida with Pennsylvania and Louisiana, which have already adopted similar language. Delaware and Texas will take up these measures during their 2026 legislative sessions, while Alaska’s measure failed in the Senate.
These small changes to legal terminology come amid a broad, national push to ensure precise language is used when it comes to victims of sensitive, heinous crimes like child sexual abuse, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation. The Department of Justice in 2023 published a memo noting that although the term “child pornography” still appears in federal law, officials prefer to use “child sexual abuse material” because it’s a better reflection of the crime.
The memo points out that in 2016 an international group working to combat child exploitation formally recognized “child sexual abuse material” as the preferred term.
This isn’t Florida’ first foray into passing legislation dealing with child sexual abuse — albeit in generally more extreme terms. In 2023, the Florida Legislature became the first in decades to pass a law expanding the death penalty to child rapists. In 2024, it defined and created punishments for “grooming,” which involves enticing children into sex. During the 2025 session, it added human trafficking of a minor as another crime eligible for execution.
The 2026 session begins Jan. 13.

Oh, and a trip to Canada. 
Tepper shared in an interview with CommonWealth Beacon that she took a previously-unreported trip up to Nova Scotia last month to meet with officials to discuss how Massachusetts can potentially tap into Canadian offshore wind, much in the way the state will soon have access to 1,200 megawatts of hydropower from Quebec.  
What’s more: Healey will be in Canada in a few weeks, too, with other New England governors for a not-yet-public forum to discuss energy, in addition to other issues, said Tepper, who spoke on the sidelines of the ClimateBeacon conference in Boston. 
And despite the federal rollbacks on clean energy funding and wind permitting that jeopardize Massachusetts’s climate targets, Tepper said that delaying those goals is “not our focus right now.” She also defended the Mass Save energy efficiency program, which was cut earlier this year and has been attacked as an unnecessary driver of high utility bills.  
This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
The governor last week asked DPU to review all charges on bills. One of the most concrete things the state can do right now to avoid higher energy costs is for the DPU to reject the rate hike requests pending from the utilities. Would you personally like to see the DPU reject those requests? 
The governor asked the DPU to look at all the rates and charges. They’re there, in front of them now, and they have to do their process. It’s an adjudicatory process, and they’ll make a decision. But overall, last year, when the weather was very cold, we made some changes. Those changes are going to be reflected on the bills this winter.  
With the current federal environment, additional offshore wind seemingly stalled and even solar declining last year, do you think Massachusetts should be delaying the climate goals it has adopted?  
Clean energy is the way that we’re going to be powering the future. So regardless of any of that, we need to be bringing more clean energy into the state. We’re really focused on making sure that we can work with our regional colleagues and procure – we’re trying to unlock some energy up in Maine. What makes it so unique is that all the states have agreed ahead of time how we’re going to pay for it. With transmission, it’s always about how you’re going to pay for it. So that’s going to unlock this wind that we all have been dying to get from Maine. And we’ve got procurements going on with Connecticut. We’re really all working together to make sure that we have more supply coming in.  
The governor has talked about an “all of the above” approach, and that means we’re all working together to look at new nuclear, to look at where we are with gas, to look at where we’re going with geothermal. So it’s all about bringing all the energy in, primarily to reduce costs. 
So you don’t see a need to adjust or push back any of the climate targets. 
It’s not our focus right now. The biggest driver of [utility] bills is about transmission and distribution. It’s about infrastructure. So our energy affordability bill is really focused on that part of [consumers’ energy] bills. That’s what’s going up the fastest.  
On solar, why does the administration propose cutting net-metering rates in your energy affordability legislation? Does that send mixed messages on how much and how fast the state wants to increase solar deployment? 
One of the goals is to get some charges off the bill. We’re trying to lower costs, and we have one of the highest net-metering costs in the country. This is a forward-looking thing, and it would be specifically for large facilities. So you and your house, you’re still net-metering. I’m still net-metering. And it’s not getting rid of it, it’s lowering it to make it more consistent with what it is in the rest of the country. 
Do you think that the Mass Save program should be cut any further than it already has been? 
Last year, the DPU did reduce some of the cost of Mass Save, and those costs will be reflected in this year’s bills. Mass Save is an extremely valuable and important program and has saved customers millions and millions of dollars. I think what people sometimes forget about energy efficiency is it’s not just beneficial for the people who are doing it. It’s beneficial for all of us. When you go and look at ISO New England’s charts showing the amount of electricity that we did not use and how much money we saved because we didn’t have to build more transmission, we didn’t have to build more generation, that’s all coming from people using less electricity. It’s worth a lot of money for us to encourage people to use things efficiently. It’s a really successful program.  
On clean energy, do you have anything more to say about the state’s thinking around importing Canadian wind or building more wind itself, either onshore or in state waters?  
The governor is actually going to Canada with all the regional governors in a couple weeks. We have a good relationship with Canada. I went to Nova Scotia last month to talk to them about what they’re doing with wind. There could be some partnerships there. We’re about ready to put on this New England Clean Energy Connect project [that imports Canadian hydropower], which started with conversations many years ago, that turned into a real project. And so that’s where we’re exploring.  
The New England governors and Canadian premiers have a conference every year. And this time it’s in Newfoundland and Labrador. Some of the issues that are on the table is how can we share energy and how can we share energy costs? 
I do need to ask you, after the Cabinet went through a resignation last week, if you are comfortable in your role? Do you have any plans to leave or change your role? 
I have had the privilege of working with Gov. Healey for many years, and I’m excited to continue to work with Gov. Healey. It’s a real privilege.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A $4 billion budget request for Oklahoma public education flew through the state’s top school on Thursday and continues to the state Legislature for consideration.
If lawmakers approve the request for the 2027 fiscal year, it would represent a mostly flat budget compared to current funding levels, with only a $23.7 million spending increase caused by the rising cost of public educators’ insurance premiums. The only cut is an expiring $50,000 expense to purchase a curriculum on the Civil Rights Movement.
This is the first budget request from new state Superintendent Lindel Fields. His administration’s proposal included fewer cuts than what Fields’ predecessor, Ryan Walters, suggested last month shortly before resigning Sept. 30. Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to finish Walters’ term through January 2027.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education tabled Walters’ budget request, which would have cut $2.5 million to offset some of the insurance costs, and unanimously approved Fields’ proposal. 
The Oklahoma State Department of Education’s current $3.9 billion appropriation is the largest of any state agency.

Some of Walters’ priorities still will carry over to the new administration. Fields’ head of finance, Kristen Stephens, said the Oklahoma State Department of Education is prepared to spend $11.9 million on literacy instruction, particularly on high-dosage reading tutoring, which Walters also supported.
Stephens said the agency also plans to spend $42.3 million on teacher recruitment and retention, with much of it supporting the Oklahoma Teacher Empowerment Program. The program uses lottery funds to give bonuses to classroom teachers who take on mentorship roles and extra responsibilities in their schools.
Although the literacy and teacher empowerment initiatives aren’t new to the Education Department, Fields said he wanted to “highlight those resources that are available.”
Oklahoma lawmakers, five of whom attended the board’s meeting Thursday, will consider the budget request when they convene the 2026 legislative session in February.

After approving the budget proposal, the board declined to issue an accreditation warning to 14 school districts with multi-year deficiencies. Board members said they have concerns that Walters’ administration tainted the accreditation process.
Each public school and district in Oklahoma must be accredited by the state Board of Education, and their specific accreditation status ties to whether the Education Department identified any deficiencies in their finances, operations, governance or academic performance.
A former employee of Walters’ administration, Kourtney Heard, wrote in her resignation letter that the agency committed “manipulation of school accreditation.” The Education Department then suppressed the release of Heard’s and other senior employees’ resignation letters until Fields took over the agency.
Board member Becky Carson said she “can’t in good conscience vote for an approval for these warnings because of information that these items might have been altered at some point.”

The board unanimously voted in favor of Carson’s suggestion that all 14 districts remain at the same accreditation status they had the previous year, giving them another year to address their deficiencies.
“I’d like for us to get a better understanding of this because if a school has deficiencies, that’s serious,” board member Chris Van Denhende said during the meeting. “If they’re released from that (deficiency) and they haven’t fixed it, that’s serious, as well. So I think we need to return some credibility to this process and make sure that we look at it very carefully.”

Phil Murphy announced a deal that would allow the owners of a Cranbury farm to prevent the town from seizing it to build affordable housing.,"Cranbury township officials had sought to claim a portion of a 21-acre beef cattle farm through eminent domain to site affordable housing. (Nikita Biryukov | New Jersey Monitor)Cranbury officials have asked a Superior Court judge to delay proceedings over their bid to seize a local farm for affordable housing using eminent domain, saying pending regulatory changes could give the township other means to meet its affordable housing obligations.
The township’s bid to claim the farm, which is family-owned and tenant-operated, drew controversy and attention from Republican officials. Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee for governor, has campaigned in Cranbury, and the township’s move to seize the land drew opposition from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
But Gov. Phil Murphy on Thursday announced a potential end to the controversy, saying his administration and the involved parties have reached an agreement to ensure the farm remains under its current ownership while Cranbury leaders look elsewhere to build affordable housing.
“For 175 years, the Henry Family Farm has stood on South River Road in Cranbury as a proud symbol of that agricultural tradition,” Murphy said in a statement. “New Jersey will always protect its farmers and farmland. And we will always live up to our reputation as the Garden State.”
What happens to ‘pioneering’ public safety program under next governor?

The beef cattle farm sits on a 21-acre plot less than 600 feet from the New Jersey Turnpike, separated from the major roadway by chain-link fencing and a trio of warehouses minutes from Exit 8A. It has about 40 head of cattle, including a vocal steer named Lucky.
Local officials had sought to claim some of the property to meet the township’s affordable housing obligations, which require it to stand up 265 low- and moderate-income units over the next decade.
The township’s affordable housing plan would have involved the seizure of about 11.6 acres — not including a 19th-century farmhouse and other buildings — for the creation of 130 housing units, all of which would be subject to affordability controls.
Township officials said little land in the township of about 2,300 was developable under state affordable housing standards, and the few other sites that were could be ineligible for federal tax credits that subsidize housing production.
In a letter to the court signed by other parties in the case, Kevin Van Hise, an attorney for the township, said amendments stemming from comments submitted by the township and others on a pending rules proposal on low-income housing tax credit allocation could forestall the need for seizure through eminent domain.
“The parties believe this is the best path forward and will likely result in a final settlement agreement that will resolve the vast majority of claims in the submitted challenges,” Van Hise said in the letter.
The township’s comments on the rulemaking proposal have not yet been publicly released.
The Fair Share Housing Center, a nonprofit that litigates to ensure municipalities meet their affordable housing obligations and opposed the selection of the site for different reasons, was also pausing its challenge to the farm’s selection.
The center had opposed siting affordable housing at the farm because of its isolated location and the warehouses surrounding the site.
It’s not clear what changes will be made to the voluminous rules proposal, though Murphy said the Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency was expected to finalize them by the end of the year.

“It has come to our attention that certain reading materials on the Epic Reading platform may not align with the diverse belief systems of all our school district families,” North Little Rock School District administrators wrote in the memo.

Action Memo-Epic Reading Content 
Epic is a digital reading platform that hosts more than 40,000 books, audiobooks and educational videos. The two-page memo provides NLRSD staff with a step-by-step process for how to hide the listed 50 books from students.
“This measure is a proactive step to ensure all content used in our classrooms is appropriate for our students and respectful of family beliefs,” the memo states. “We affirm the worth and dignity of every student and family in our district and remain committed to providing learning environments where all children feel safe, accepted, and supported. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.”
The memo is from Superintendent Gregory Pilewski, Assistant Superintendents of School Performance Thomas Rogers and Jacob Smith, Assistant Superintendent of Network Support Services LeAnn Stoll, and Coordinator of English Language Arts (ELA), Literacy and Reading Carmen Langston.
Over the past few years, some Arkansas elected officials and community coalitions have sought to keep LGBTQ+ content out of children’s reach in libraries, calling it “indoctrination” and “age-inappropriate.” Opponents of such efforts have said this content reflects the community and restricting access to it is censorship.
Most of these efforts have pertained to public libraries, but some school districts have restricted access to certain books, such as Conway and Farmington.
Some of the titles North Little Rock administrators seek to keep away from students include:

“Love Wins,” an account of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States;
“Bathe the Cat,” a children’s book about household chores that includes a rainbow flag in an illustration of a family’s refrigerator;
“The Mother of a Movement,” a biography of Jeanne Manford, the founder of PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays);
Biographies of LGBTQ+ public figures Megan Rapinoe and Jazz Jennings.

As of Thursday morning, NLRSD spokesperson Dustin Barnes had not responded to an email asking what prompted the memo.
Laws on book challenges, ‘indoctrination’ create culture of fear in Arkansas school libraries

All Arkansas schools are required to have content challenge policies in place, and Act 372 of 2023 put the final say on the availability of challenged books in the hands of school boards. Librarians told the Advocate in 2023 that the new law created a culture of fear and self-censorship in Arkansas school libraries.
The same law would have given city and county officials authority over challenged books, but U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of Fayetteville blocked this portion of the law temporarily in 2023 and permanently in 2024. The state appealed Brooks’ ruling this year.
Act 372 also would have created criminal liability for school and public librarians who distribute content that some consider “obscene” or “harmful to minors,” two terms that the law does not define. Brooks’ injunction also blocked this provision.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kid-in-library-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:17:30.708338

(John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In a defeat for Gov. Bill Lee’s administration, a three-judge panel ruled against the state’s effort to end a longstanding lawsuit challenging the vagueness and inadequacy of exceptions to Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban.
Attorneys for the state asked for a ruling in their favor, without a trial, in a lawsuit brought in 2023 by a group of Tennessee OB-GYNs and women who had suffered serious medical problems during their pregnancies. The American Medical Association subsequently joined the lawsuit.
State attorneys had argued that a 2025 amendment adding “medical necessity exceptions” to Tennessee’s 2022 abortion ban made the lawsuit moot.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But the Chancery Court panel disagreed, signaling skepticism that exceptions to the state’s abortion ban were adequate to protect the lives and health of pregnant women in Tennessee.
The plaintiffs, the judges wrote, “have sufficiently alleged that the defects in the Medical Necessity Exception place their lives at risk in violation of their constitutional right to life.”
“The changes made by the 2025 Amendment do not significantly alter the status of this case,” the panel wrote, concluding the lawsuit contained sufficiently serious and credible allegations to move forward.
Tennessee abortion ban
Tennessee’s strict abortion ban, which went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, was amended twice to provide limited exceptions for medical conditions. The law, in its original form and as amended, does not contain exceptions for victims of rape or incest, or for pregnancies with fetal abnormalities.
In 2023, Gov. Bill Lee signed into law an amendment that said a doctor may perform one “using reasonable medical judgement, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time” if the abortion is necessary to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or to “prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”  The legislation also added molar and ectopic pregnancies as exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.

It was this 2023 legislation the lawsuit initially challenged as overly vague.
In 2024, the three-judge panel temporarily blocked the state’s medical board from disciplining doctors for providing emergency abortions but declined to block criminal prosecution of physicians, saying it lacked the authority to do so.
Their ruling also outlined four specific pregnancy-related conditions that qualify as “medical necessity” exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, noting the then “confusion and lack of consensus within the Tennessee medical community on the circumstances requiring necessary health- and life-saving abortion care.”
The four conditions include: “previable preterm premature rupture of the membranes; inevitable abortion, defined as dilation of the cervix prior to viability of the pregnancy, either by preterm labor or cervical insufficiency;” :fatal fetal diagnoses that lead to maternal health conditions, such as severe preeclampsia and mirror syndrome associated with fetal hydrops;” and “fatal fetal diagnoses leading to an infection that will result in uterine rupture or potential loss of fertility.”
This year, lawmakers further amended the state’s abortion ban to include the four conditions outlined by the chancery court ruling. The amendment says doctors “may” provide an abortion for these conditions.
The 2025 legislation also explicitly excludes mental health diagnoses as a medical exception to the state’s abortion ban. The panel’s decision, issued last week, allows the plaintiffs to challenge the lack of a mental health- related exception to the abortion ban.

State must turn over documents

The panel in a separate decision last week allowed the plaintiffs to obtain internal documents from the Tennessee General Assembly, the governor and legislative committees that reveal the” state’s interest in enforcing the amended abortion ban and medical exceptions.”
The panel likewise allowed for subpoenas to Tennessee Department of Health for data on abortions, maternal mortality and any unofficial guidance the department has issued to health providers since 2022.

On Monday, attorneys for the state filed an emergency motion seeking permission to appeal the ruling requiring state officials to comply with the subpoenas.
State attorneys said the decision to force state officials to turn over internal documents “presents a momentous separation-of-powers  question – pitting the state judiciary against the other two branches – that should be decided by the appellate courts.”
The group filing suit is represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based law firm.
Tennessee requires three-judge panels to consider challenges to state law. Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, Judge Sandra Donaghy and Chancellor Kasey Culbreath issued the opinion in this case.

Toulouse Oliver has served as secretary of state since 2016—when she served a two-year term—and is in her second four-year term. She previously spent close to a decade as Bernalillo county clerk.
As recently as late August, Toulouse Oliver said she was not planning a run for office, telling Source New Mexico that she was instead focusing on her finishing her election-related dissertation at the University of New Mexico. She said she changed her mind after “a lot of folks” worried about the state of the country approached her in recent months urging her to stay in elected office.
“I have always felt called to service, so I felt that I was being called again, and that’s why I changed my mind,” she said.
Toulouse Oliver’s announcement follows State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard’s withdrawal from the race last week due to her husband’s health issues. New Mexico State Sen. Harold Pope of Albuquerque and Loving Village Councilor Jackie Lee Onsurez remain in the Democratic primary race. Republican Manny Lardzibal thus far faces no opposition in that contest.
In a 40-second video embedded in her new campaign website, Toulouse Oliver pointed to her time battling “MAGA extremists” over their false claims of election fraud in New Mexico and across the country after the 2020 election. She testified before Congress in July 2022 that threats against her office spiked, including several her office reported to police, after the issue came to a head in Otero County during the 2022 primary election.
In the video, Toulouse Oliver said New Mexico is “facing a moment unlike any in our history. Donald Trump is attacking our democracy and pushing an extreme agenda. New Mexico needs a fighter who will stand up to him. That’s why I’m running for Lt. Governor.”
As for her dissertation, Toulouse said she’s still working on it, but “it’s probably going to take a little more time now,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8317-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Six weeks after Hasbro Inc. showed its cards by announcing plans to relocate its headquarters from Pawtucket to Boston by the end of 2026, few additional details have been revealed.
Indeed, there was almost no mention of the pending move — including its effects on jobs and costs — in the company’s third-quarter earnings report, published Thursday morning, nor during the accompanying 60-minute call with investors.
The only acknowledgment of the news that rocked Rhode Island was a footnote tucked into the legal disclaimer of the 19-page financial filing: 
“Our business could be adversely affected by challenges and disruptions arising from the loss of skills, knowledge or expertise, and from uncertainty regarding the continued employment of key personnel, particularly as a result of recent workforce reductions and the planned relocation of our Rhode Island operations to Boston, Massachusetts.”
Andrea Snyder, a spokesperson for Hasbro, did not immediately respond to questions on the costs and timing of the move Thursday morning. 
Hasbro has already confirmed it will leave no trace of its century-old Rhode Island roots after relocating the majority of its local workforce to Boston by the end of 2026. The company announced in September it has inked a deal to lease seven floors of a 16-story laboratory building in the Boston Seaport, but the rent it will pay for a prime piece of city real estate remains unknown. Rhode Island leaders had attempted to entice the company to stay within state lines, even if not at its existing Newport Avenue headquarters, by offering up a piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1.
But tax incentives were never discussed during the Rhode Island General Assembly’s 2025 session, while Massachusetts leaders spent more than a year negotiating with Hasbro executives over potential tax breaks, according to publicly released emails first reported by the Boston Business Journal. Hasbro ultimately secured $14 million in state tax credits, approved by the Massachusetts Economic Development Council on Sept. 17, for the 700 jobs it has promised to bring to its new headquarters.
Hasbro employs more than 1,000 people in Rhode Island now, suggesting some might be laid off as part of the move. But the company has not given any notice of mass layoffs to the state Department of Labor and training as of Thursday. Private employers with more than 100 workers are required to give state and local officials 60 days notice before making cuts under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Earlier this year, the company warned that tariffs could force staffing cuts.
Digital gaming drives growth
While trade wars with China continue to sap potential profits — with an estimated $20 million in losses due to tariffs nationwide in the third quarter — Hasbro has bounced back quickly.
The company reported a $233.2 million profit for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, up 17.4% from the same period in 2023. Earnings per diluted share rose 5 basis points year over year, from $1.59 per share to $1.64 per share.
The strong financial showing, which beat analysts’ expectations, was largely driven by its digital gaming business, including MAGIC: The Gathering, which continues to see record revenue, up 55% year over year — reaching $459.4 million as of Sept. 30 — amid interest from new players and collaborations with beloved brands like Marvel’s Spider-Man. 
The company’s digital licensing business, which includes Monopoly GO!, also boosted the bottom line by 21% to $364.6 million, according to the earnings report.
The gains were partially offset by declines in toy sales with delayed orders from retailers amid inflationary cost hikes and the fallout from international trade wars. 
Yet CEO Chris Cocks remained optimistic on a call with investors Wednesday, touting the start to a long-term growth period for the toy segment in the final three months of this year. 
The company has already begun to shift its supply chain away from China —- where it had sourced 50% of its toys and games — with the goal of sourcing no more than 30% of its products from any single country outside the United States by the end of next year.
“Hasbro delivered another quarter of growth, highlighting the strength of our brands and Playing to Win strategy,” Cocks said in a statement. “We’re poised to enter 2026 with momentum.”
The company also revised its year-end projections upward, expecting total revenue growth in the “high single digits” with an adjusted operating margin of 22% to 23%. In late April, a month after President Donald Trump just as President Donald Trump unveiled 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, Hasbro predicted a $60 million to $180 million operating loss for the year.
Scaling back of tariffs — now at 30% for Chinese imports, has soothed Hasbro’s fears, along with strategies for “opportunistic debt reduction” and “cost discipline,” company executives said.
Still, $60 million in losses from tariffs are expected through the end of the year, with a larger figure in 2026 assuming a full-year impact from the trade wars, Gina Goetter, Hasbro’s chief financial and chief operating officer, said on the earnings call Thursday.
“We’re still working through the net impact,” Goetter said, noting that the financial losses from tariffs didn’t manifest on the company’s balance sheet until the third quarter of 2025.
Shares rose 2.1% in the first two hours following Hasbro’s earnings release Thursday morning. 
The Boston Seaport office will house Hasbro’s corporate services, as well as its toy, board game and licensing arms. Its digital gaming business, which includes MAGIC: The Gathering, will remain at its present hub in Renton, Washington, which features 111,000 square feet and 500 employees.

U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate sent a letter on Tuesday to the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts in response to an inquiry from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. Wingate acknowledged that his law clerk used an AI program to compose an order that paused the enforcement of a state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Mississippi public schools. 
The order, issued July 20, was factually inaccurate — naming defendants and plaintiffs that weren’t parties to the case, misquoting state law and referencing a case that doesn’t exist — which led the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office to raise concerns. 
Wingate then replaced the order with a corrected version, wiped the flawed order from the docket, and denied a request from the Attorney General’s Office to restore the original order with errors to the public docket. He refused to explain the errors, calling them “clerical” mistakes.
Months later, Grassley sent a letter to Wingate, asking him to address the errors and the speculated use of AI.
Wingate finally acknowledged that one of his law clerks used an AI program called Perplexity to analyze publicly available information from the docket to craft the order. But Wingate emphasized no privileged or sealed information was used. Wingate says he still does not plan to restore the original order to the docket, in an effort to avoid confusion. 
The judge conceded that the order was a draft opinion, and it did not undergo proper review before being added to the docket. Wingate said he’s taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again. 
The corrective measures include requiring all draft opinions, orders and memos to undergo a second, independent review. He will also require all cited cases be printed and attached to the final draft. 
“I manage a very busy docket and strive to maintain the public’s trust by administering justice in a fair and transparent manner,” Wingate wrote. “Given that I hold myself and my staff to the highest standards of conduct, I do not expect that a mistake like this one will occur in the future.”
Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, commended Wingate, a Reagan-appointed judge, for acknowledging the mistake.
“Each federal judge, and the judiciary as an institution, has an obligation to ensure the use of generative AI does not violate litigants’ rights or prevent fair treatment under the law,” Grassley said in a statement. “The judicial branch needs to develop more decisive, meaningful and permanent AI policies and guidelines.” 
Still, AI usage in the federal judiciary is a serious issue, and it’s largely uncharted territory, especially among federal judges.  
The legal profession has seen a rise in AI use in recent years, with people relying on software or processes that attempt to replicate aspects of human work. These use vast amounts of data to accomplish tasks such as researching court cases and citing them in legal briefs. 
But these systems are not perfect and can “hallucinate,” or provide false information. 
Judges in Mississippi have punished attorneys in both federal and state courts for using AI because attorneys have an ethical and professional responsibility to tell the truth in court. 
But there’s little accountability when the roles are reversed. 
Robert Conrad Jr., the director of the federal Administrative Office of the Courts, also sent Grassley a letter noting that he recently established an AI task force composed of judges and technology experts to recommend new policies on AI usage in the federal court system. 
Conrad said the task force, during the summer, published interim guidance on AI, suggesting that attorneys should review and independently verify all AI-generated content and should consider disclosing when they’ve used AI to help craft documents.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-23 16:26:36+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,ICE sweeps viewed as ‘real awakening’ by immigration bill backers,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/ice-sweeps-viewed-as-real-awakening-by-immigration-bill-backers/,Supporters of the so-called Safe Communities Act say the stepped-up raids have stoked fear in immigrant communities and underscore the need to shield local law enforcement from entanglement with federal immigration authorities.,"WITH ENFORCEMENT of immigration laws surging in Massachusetts, a coalition of advocates rallied Wednesday and attached new urgency to the call for lawmakers to revive a long-stalled proposal that top legislative leaders have repeatedly dismissed.
The rally comes a week after federal officials announced the results of “Operation Patriot 2.0,” in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 1,406 people statewide due to their immigration status between Sept. 4 and 30. ICE said just over 600, less than half, of those detained had been convicted of or charged with serious crimes. Nearly 300 had previously been ordered removed by immigration judges.
Supporters of the so-called Safe Communities Act (S 1681 / H 2580) say the stepped-up raids have stoked fear in immigrant communities and underscore the need to shield local law enforcement from entanglement with federal immigration authorities. The bill, filed every term since at least 2017, would bar police and court officers from inquiring about immigration status and prohibit local cooperation with ICE unless required by law.
“I think there’s been a real awakening… all the sharing on social media of the outrages that have been committed by ICE have made abundantly clear there is a definite need to do what we can do to protect all our communities, and that local police shouldn’t be swept up into the enforcement of federal immigration laws,” said Frank Soults, spokesperson for 32BJ SEIU, a union representing largely immigrant workers.
Top Democrats on Beacon Hill have shown little appetite to advance the measure, which was filed at the start of the year but hasn’t been scheduled for a hearing by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee.
Asked last month whether the increased ICE activity warranted movement for on the bill, House Speaker Ron Mariano said, “I don’t know if it’s a year for that.” 
He added that immigration enforcement is a federal matter, not one for state government to address. “There has to be a way for us to coexist without having to get into defining and limiting each other’s specific charges,” Mariano said.
Senate President Karen Spilka similarly downplayed the need for the legislation, arguing that much of what the bill proposes is already standard practice in Massachusetts. 
“Massachusetts has been clear that we will help federal ICE if and when there are criminal issues, criminals being arrested,” she said, noting concerns come when people are detained without clear justification or warrants.
The legislation was last sent to a study order in 2023, effectively killing its progress for the session.
Advocates argue the political winds have shifted, pointing to passage of a 2023 law enabling undocumented immigrants to apply for driver’s licenses, and $5 million the Legislature earmarked this year for undocumented immigrants to access legal services if arrested by ICE. 
“I think there has been a turning point. It’s taken a long time… but we’re hopeful,” said Soults. “We feel like the coalition is stronger now than ever.”
Supporters say recent ICE operations have hardened community support for the bill. Sen. Sal DiDomenico, whose district includes Everett and Chelsea, which have large immigrant populations, condemned ICE actions. 
“We have a rogue agency coming into our communities every single day of the week, breaking the law, causing terror,” he said. “Words don’t make a difference. Only action is what gets us to a place where we can bring dignity back to this country.”
Rep. Manny Cruz of Salem, the son of immigrants, said the State House “must” pass the bill this session and needs to take a stronger stance. 
“This house here,” he said, gesturing to the State House, “We have work to do. We need to ensure that we’re living up to our values and our commitment to be a place of equity and justice for all.”
When asked specifically if Gov. Maura Healey, Mariano and Spilka were doing enough to protect immigrants, Cruz said legislative leaders have met with the Black and Latino Legislative Caucus to discuss immigration enforcement. 
“I think that those meetings were well received,” he said. “What I’ll name is that we have more work to do as a coalition to ensure that we’re building support outside of the building,” calling for broader backing from law enforcement and local officials.
Federal officials, meanwhile, have defended their operations. ICE officials said Operation Patriot 2.0 focused on individuals who had violated immigration law, including 277 who had previously been ordered deported. 
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the operation “exposed the grave consequences of sanctuary policies.”
Healey has repeatedly said Massachusetts is not a sanctuary state, but the Trump administration has targeted Boston as one of 35 “sanctuary jurisdictions” that they say impede the enforcement of federal immigration laws.
“Every illegal alien we arrested during the operation was breaking U.S. immigration law, and hundreds were violent criminals who should never have been allowed to roam freely in our communities,” Lyons said. “Local politicians are responsible for protecting their constituents, so they need to step up and end irresponsible sanctuary policies.”
ICE Boston’s acting Field Office Director David Wesling said those arrested include “murderers, rapists, drug traffickers, child sex predators and members of violent transnational criminal gangs.”
Still, the bill’s backers say raids are sweeping up too many people who pose no threat, while fostering distrust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement — something they believe the bill would fix.
“As a state, as local municipalities, we have to stand up and be willing to say that we will not lend a hand to ICE to tear apart our communities,” Cruz said. “Instead, we will send a message of true public safety, that regardless of your documentation status, that you can come to our local police department and report a crime without the fear of being deported.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68f9242c83aec.image_-1.webp?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819

As North Carolina hospitals bear the impact of lost Medicaid funding at the state and federal levels, a report from the North Carolina Healthcare Association shows they provided $7.4 billion in benefits to their communities in 2024.
Released by the state hospital advocacy group on Wednesday, the report shows that North Carolina hospitals provided $417 million for medical education and training, $145 million for subsidized health services such as neonatal care, addiction recovery, and trauma services, and $106 million for health research, among other benefits last year.
The report, aimed at showcasing community benefits and work that serves the public good, provides a counterpoint to criticism frequently leveled at hospitals by some elected leaders in North Carolina. Former Republican state Treasurer Dale Folwell, an outspoken critic who called the hospital system a “cartel,” frequently accused them of failing to meet their obligations for charity care and cost transparency.

It also highlights investments in the state’s healthcare pipeline. Education initiatives detailed in the report, for example, are intended to counter a projected shortage of around 9,000 registered nurses in the state by 2030, with hospitals partnering with Appalachian State University and Coastal Carolina Community College among others to offer tuition assistance and scholarships and launch new nursing programs and fellowships.
However, NCHA President Josh Dobson warned, those investments are at risk.
Dobson wrote in an open letter that even as hospitals are “underfunded for the care they provide,” they are duty-bound to provide care for uninsured and underinsured patients. That leaves them vulnerable to  greater financial hardship if more North Carolinians lose access to Medicaid benefits.
“These challenges are too great for any hospital to face alone,” Dobson wrote. “Hospitals depend on strong partnerships, innovation, and sustainable resources to create programs that make a real difference — and to remain financially strong so they can continue this work for years to come.”
The General Assembly has been deadlocked for months over fully funding the state’s Medicaid program, resulting in cuts to reimbursement rates for all services this month. And cuts to the program enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cost state health providers billions, particularly if it triggers the end of North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion, which has extended coverage to roughly 680,000 residents.

The report indicated that North Carolina hospitals are at risk of losing $32 billion in Medicaid funding over the next decade under program changes passed in the bill. That drop in funding imperils the rural hospitals that serve 80 of the state’s 100 counties.
“This will make it challenging to do this important work to keep people healthy and out of the hospital, which is critical to lowering healthcare costs for everyone,” the report says. “There is still time for Congress to act to prevent some of these cuts from happening and protect both hospitals and the people they serve.”
Many of these facilities were already on the brink. In 2023, Martin General Hospital of Williamston closed, leaving its county without a local hospital. According to the report, providers like East Carolina University Health have tried to fill the gaps, offering free health screenings in Martin County and proposing in June to reopen the hospital for emergency care.
The report also details how hospitals stepped in during Hurricane Helene to provide aid, with Mission Hospital in Asheville seeing 3,500 patients and treating another 5,500 in clinics. In the months after, its staff helped distribute food and water to those in need.
“It was an incredible sight, the way that these team members were all working together from different departments that have never even met before,” said Taylor McCaulley, a nurse manager at Mission Hospital in a video accompanying the report. “You’re seeing all of these staff members that are coming in just to truly save the day for them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicaid-cuts-nurse-Getty-2025.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819

State unemployment records indicate Joyce D. Richardson, the City of Jefferson’s utility billing clerk, was fired in July for alleged theft, dishonesty, failing to follow policies and procedures, and failing to complete city records as required.
According to the records, Richardson was responsible for receiving the $150 deposits that new utility customers paid when opening their accounts with the city. The deposits could be made electronically or through cash or check.

At a recent hearing on Richardson’s unemployment-benefits claim, city officials testified that on March 25, 2025, the city’s finance officer, Sarah Morlan, and City Clerk Roxanne Gorsuch reported that a cash deposit collected from a new utility customer appeared to be missing.
According to the testimony, an audit into the city’s utility account deposits was conducted, after which it was determined that three cash deposits — made in December 2024, January 2025 and March 2025 — were missing and that all three were handled by Richardson.
In April, city officials asked Richardson to search for the missing deposits, but she allegedly indicated she did not have time due to her “billing preparation” work. She was then placed on unpaid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter, and the Greene County Sheriff’s Office was contacted.
According to the state unemployment records, a sheriff’s office investigator prepared a report, with findings, that in late June was forwarded to the Greene County Attorney’s Office for consideration of criminal charges, and to the city and the Office of Auditor of State.
On July 3, 2025, the city fired Richardson. She subsequently filed for unemployment benefits, which led to the recent hearing before Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson.
State records indicate that at the hearing, Richardson testified she believed the city fired her in retaliation for taking time off to speak with someone about applying for a different job but also testified that none of her coworkers liked her and that they had conspired to force her out of her job.
Johnson recently ruled the evidence suggested Richardson committed workplace misconduct and was ineligible for unemployment benefits.
“The employer has presented credible testimony that claimant took three $150 cash utility account deposits,” Johnson ruled.  “This money should have been deposited into the employer’s account, not taken by claimant for her own personal purposes. Every employer across all industries has the right to expect that employees do not steal. Theft of company assets, whether money or equipment or time, is disqualifying misconduct even without prior warning.”
Court records indicate no criminal charges were filed in the case. Richardson had worked for the city since August 2020, according to state records.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was not able to reach Richardson for comment.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)Environmental groups’ request that a federal court shutter the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center was paused Wednesday because of the government shutdown.
Led by the non-profit Friends of the Everglades, a coalition of activists had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider its September decision to keep open the migrant detention center, located in the heart of the Everglades, despite environmental concerns.
But the court on Wednesday agreed with the Department of Homeland Security that the case should be paused until government attorneys can work again.
“The motion to stay the appeal is granted. The movant is directed to file a notice with the court when the purpose for the stay is obviated,” the two-sentence order reads.
Although this comes just weeks after the court expedited the appeal and scheduled oral arguments for January, the federal government’s shutdown on Sept. 30 set off a cascade of missed pay, furloughed workers, and in-limbo cases.
So, on Oct. 10, government attorneys, noting that many Justice Department lawyers are banned from working until the government comes online again, asked for a pause on the case until “DOJ attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions.”
How did we get here?
The state created the sprawling, 3,000-bed facility atop the seldom-used Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Big Cypress National Park, drawing scrutiny from Democrats, immigration groups, and environmental organizations since its July 1 opening.
Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws. A district judge agreed, ordering Florida to shut down the center by September’s end. But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.
A week later, DHS and Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie revealed that Florida had applied for federal reimbursement — though Friends of the Everglades believes the request was made earlier. On Sept. 30, the state received more than $608 million to pay for the construction, transportation, and equipment costs of the facility
The plaintiffs soon after appealed, asking the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider. When DHS pointed out that some government staff couldn’t work during the shutdown, Friends of the Everglades called the situation “regrettable” but argued it didn’t outweigh the environment “harms” caused by dragging out the case.
“An indefinite stay in this case … would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm where the federal action being challenged — the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Everglades that imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area — would continue during the indefinite stay period,” the attorneys wrote.
When the Eleventh Circuit released its order against them, Eve Samples, executive director of the Friends of the Everglades, put out a statement calling the move a ruse to avoid accountability.
“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said. “Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.
“We’re more resolved than ever to keep fighting to restore the lower court’s injunction to protect the Everglades.”

U.S. tariff measures, combined with China’s halted soybean purchases, are hitting Missouri farmers where it hurts, threatening billions of dollars in export revenue and shaking Missouri’s agricultural backbone.


Since April 2, the day President Donald Trump dubbed “Liberation Day” and imposed sweeping tariffs on America’s trade partners, businesses have been scrambling to adapt. Missouri is no different, with its agriculture sector being heavily strained.

Soybeans are Missouri’s most valuable agricultural product. The state produced nearly $2.9 billion worth of the crop last year, which ranked sixth nationally.

But amidst tariffs and a trade dispute with China, which previously was the biggest importer of U.S. soybeans, American farmers are seeing a steep drop in exports.

Bryant Kagay owns Kagay Farms in Maysville, where he primarily grows corn, soybeans and wheat. Kagay said he has experienced a “significant” drop in soybean prices.


“Over the past several months, there’s been a pretty good decline through the growing season for the expected cash price of soybeans,” Kagay said.


At the center of this struggle is the tense trade relationship between the U.S. and China. In 2024, U.S. farmers sold more than $12.6 billion worth of soybeans to China, making up more than half of all American soybean exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


China was one of the first major targets of tariffs after Trump began his second term. Following a series of trade escalations earlier in the year, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods reached as high as 125% in April. However, a temporary agreement reached in May significantly rolled back many of those increases.


Currently, the baseline import tax on Chinese products stands at 10%, though certain products still face additional duties above that level.


In response, Beijing not only has utilized reciprocal tariffs, but also has stopped purchasing U.S soybeans, which has been detrimental to American farmers.


“Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis.” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement issued Oct. 10.


While global demand for U.S soybeans shrinks and prices decline, many producers are struggling to cover their costs. Currently, soybean prices are hovering around $10 per bushel, well below their $13 per bushel level in December 2023, according to the USDA.


“The fact that China is not buying soybeans now has been a very big negative for the market, causing prices to be lower and their producer returns to be far less than they would have been otherwise,” said Pat Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri.

In addition to torpedoing demand for U.S. soybeans, the Trump administration’s trade measures have posed challenges for farmers and business owners because of their unpredictable nature.


Tariff policies have changed rapidly, and court cases against some tariffs are still pending, leaving many Missouri farmers left without a clear roadmap.


“Farmers are trying to decide which crop to plant next spring, which investments to make. It’s really hard to know for sure what to do,” Westhoff said. “Producers have to make choices about what they’re going to do in 2026 and beyond. … That’s hard to do when the environment is as uncertain as it is today.”


Many Missouri farmers may face difficult choices about how to stay profitable amid the shifting trade landscape. With global demand becoming less predictable and more scarce, farmers and policymakers are being forced to start considering ways to strengthen the domestic soybean market.


One promising area of growth lies in the expanding biofuel industry, which experts say has the potential to create more stable domestic demand for agricultural commodities.


“If there were more demand for biofuels, that would result in increased demand for corn to make ethanol, and increased demand for soybean oil to make biodiesel,” Westhoff said. “So if we were to have policy changes that encourage the use of those biofuels, that could be a positive to demand for agricultural products and support prices in the face of lost markets overseas.”

Despite the potential to develop a bigger domestic market in the future, farmers are struggling right now. To ease the burden, the federal government has discussed deploying trade relief packages, including payments under programs like the Market Facilitation Program, which was used when Trump imposed tariffs on China in his first term.


“There’s talk these days of a possible aid package that might provide some benefits to producers of soybeans and other crops and other livestock products,” Westhoff said. “If there’s not any additional assistance provided and we continue to have the sorts of disruptions we’ve had, I’d expect fewer people to plant soybeans in 2026.”


Still, while federal aid packages may offer a temporary lifeline, many farmers say they aren’t a long-term fix.


“I think they just ultimately cause inflation,” Kagay said. “What’s going to happen ultimately, the seed, chemical, fertilizer equipment dealers are going to get that money, and it just kind of kicks the can down the road.”

Flannery carried the bill in the legislature earlier this year, but it didn’t move out of a House committee. Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, filed a similar bill during the 2024 legislative session, while the late Louisville Democratic Rep. Charles Miller first introduced the legislation in 2022. 
“Really, what I want to do is make sure we can get something across the finish line that makes these products in America again, so we can use these and get people back to work,” Flannery told the committee Thursday. 
The 2025 version of the bill would have mandated contracts for construction or maintenance of public buildings or public works projects, like roads, sewers and streets, include provisions that any of the iron, steel, aluminum or any of the other manufactured goods used as a primary component be manufactured in the U.S. 
This year’s version also allowed governments to waive the Buy American requirement if it would increase the project’s cost by 10% or more. A local impact statement prepared by the Legislative Research Commission predicted the legislation would have a moderate to significant financial impact on local governments by driving up construction costs in possible several ways. No fiscal note is attached to the bill on the legislature’s site.
At the federal level, former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump have supported buying American policies. 
Chad Conley, a rapid response coordinator for United Steelworkers District 8, told the committee that the bill is “an opportunity to revitalize American manufacturing” by ensuring that public works projects in Kentucky utilize metals made in the U.S. At present, state agencies typically award contracts to the lowest bidder, “allowing foreign producers to undercut U.S. prices and win awards,” he said. 
“State preference laws like this one can change that practice to require governments to accept a bid that might be marginally higher than the lowest bid with the knowledge that money spent will be circulated back into the American economy,” Conley added. 
Mike Buckentin, CEO of Bowling Green-based nonprofit Metals Innovation Initiative, told the committee that recent investments have been made in the metals industry, particularly in Kentucky. In 2023, Nucor Steel opened a steel mill in Brandenburg, adding jobs to the Meade County community. 
“Kentucky is doing great, not just in manufacturing overall, but specifically in metals,” Buckentin said. “We continue to grow, we continue to invest and we’re one of the leaders in the nation right now in metals and in manufacturing.”
Some members of the committee expressed support for the proposal. Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville, said that lawmakers must “be careful how we construct this.” 
“I’ve always said that one of the most important things in the jobs we do as legislators is we have to create an environment where businesses want to invest in the state and can operate and at the same time create good quality jobs, because putting people to work with good quality jobs is really one of the most important things we can do,” Gentry said. 
At the end of the discussion, co-chair of the committee, Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, called the proposal “a great concept.” 
“For at least the last 30 or 40 years, some of the uniparty people in Washington have really caused some damage to our national security and the United States by shipping a lot of these industries overseas,” Wheeler said. “We need to work on getting them back here in the United States.” 
Flannery told his colleagues that he is open to making changes to the legislation before the 2026 legislative session.

Aug. 7-8 storms with straight-line winds, large hail and multiple tornadoes caused about $6 million in damage, primarily to electrical infrastructure.
Trump’s disaster declaration will unlock federal disaster aid for Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties. 
Government shutdown could stall disaster aid for North Dakota

“We appreciate President Trump and FEMA again granting our request and aiding our recovery from this summer’s extraordinary storms, which tested the capacity of our first responders, emergency managers, utility providers and citizens,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement.
Last month, Trump approved North Dakota’s request for federal aid for 19 counties damaged during June 20-21 storms.
However, the state has not yet received any disaster aid for the June storms. North Dakota officials continue working on reimbursement requests to submit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the state will not be reimbursed for those costs during the government shutdown, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — The Kansas abortion trial with wide-reaching implications for state lawmakers and health care providers wrapped Friday with arguments over the two sides’ differing definitions of pain, humanity and consciousness.
“These are not easy issues,” Judge Christopher Jayaram said at the close of the day’s proceedings.
“I take this responsibility with understanding the gravity to which I am charged,” he said.
His comments were preceded by seven days of testimony from ethicists, doctors, researchers, people who have received abortions, an animal biologist and a neonatologist as each side of the case denounced or defended state abortion restrictions.
The rules date to 1997, when Kansas legislators passed the Women’s Right to Know Act with the stated motivation of fully informing women of the risks of abortion by mandating providers comply with a list of requirements, including a 24-hour waiting period to complete consent forms, specific typefaces and page colors for paperwork, large display signs in private offices with state-approved language, informing patients a fetus at 20 weeks can feel pain, which is disputed, and a 30-minute wait between first meeting with a physician and undergoing an abortion.
Providers and advocates argue that the law stigmatizes abortions and interferes with their ability to provide them. The case also includes more recent laws, House Bill 2749 from 2024 and House Bill 2264 from 2023, that never went into effect because a judge blocked them as part of the pending lawsuit. Sometimes called the reasons mandate, the 2024 law required providers to give patients the opportunity to select from a list of reasons for obtaining their abortion and report that data to the state. The 2023 law required doctors to tell patients their abortions were reversible, which has not been conclusively proven by science.
The defendants and plaintiffs represented the most prominent sides of a long-running national dispute, a confrontation brought into focus by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Abortion in Kansas is allowed up to 22 weeks of gestation, and Kansas has some of the most permissive abortion policies among red states, in large part, due to the August 2022 statewide vote that affirmed abortion as a state constitutional right.
Farr Curlin, a professor at Duke University and a medical ethicist, testified on Oct. 16 for the state.
“Physicians are, like the public, divided about abortion,” Curlin said.
What has made abortion so controversial is the “arbitrary hostility toward one class of human beings,” he said, referring to fetuses. He argued the state’s laws advance an ethical interest in preserving the rights and life of a fetus while increasing oversight of abortion providers. He does not support abortion in most instances.
Farr said that the scientific community doesn’t agree on when human life begins
The state presented witnesses who supported its language classifying fetuses as “living, separate, whole and unique human beings” based on their clinical practices, research or other studies. Abortion providers and experts for the plaintiffs rebutted that language.
Experts and doctors also disputed claims regarding fetal pain and abortion pill reversal.
Steven Ralston, an OB-GYN and the director for maternal fetal medicine at George Washington University, testified that a difference exists between pain and reflex.
“Pain is an emotional response to some kind of unpleasant sensation,” he said.
He and other witnesses fielded questions about nociception, the body’s physiological response to stimuli that could cause tissue damage. Pain is the resulting subjective experience. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says science conclusively establishes that fetuses cannot experience pain until after 24-25 weeks. Nociception develops earlier, beginning at around 7 weeks. The state’s attorneys and witnesses used nociception as proof of fetal pain before 25 weeks. But the scientific community is not in agreement.
“It’s not an emotional response to what’s happening,” Ralston said. “It’s a reflexive response to what’s happening.”
Research into “abortion pill reversal,” which involves ingesting progesterone after taking mifepristone in an attempt to continue the pregnancy, is underdeveloped. In small studies, taking mifepristone alone, without the follow-up of misoprostol, the second step in a medication abortion, can prove dangerous.
Selina Sandoval, an OB-GYN for Planned Parenthood in Kansas, said in an Oct. 16 interview following brief testimony that the state mandating abortion providers to inform patients about abortion pill reversal requires doctors “to give misinformation” to patients. It’s not something she said she feels comfortable telling patients is an option, she said.
Being a part of the case was important to Sandoval. She said she has noticed how care has improved since the state’s restrictions were enjoined.
“I’ve personally seen the harms that the Women’s Right to Know Act has caused my patients,” she said.
A patient once told her she took buses for 19 hours to get to a Kansas clinic from Texas, she said. Affordability, work, child care and travel considerations all factor into the decision to get an abortion, Sandoval said. She called the state’s restrictions discriminatory.
“No other area of health care is under this amount of scrutiny,” Sandoval said.
 
An enormous case
Brittany Jones, the president of conservative Christian group Kansas Family Voice, sat in on much of the trial. She said in an interview it was one of the most unusual trials she has seen.
Jones took issue with the way the judge defined facets of evidence or objections in the case. The witness proceedings involved numerous objections from both sides that evoked differing reactions from the judge.
“From that standpoint, I mean, the judge appeared — I’m not going to assume anything — but he appeared very biased,” she said. “And appeared to be making rulings that were very biased and not based on the law. They were based on his opinions about abortion as a whole.”
The case at hand is a big one, Jones said.
“It started out as a big case when it included our entire informed consent law going back to 1997, that’s never been challenged, that has helped so many women in Kansas,” she said.
As the judge added more laws to the case, it grew in size and magnitude.
“We really don’t have a great idea of what strict scrutiny looks like in Kansas, how it’s applied in these cases, and so it has huge implications for how the Legislature can go about protecting women and life in the state,” Jones said.
She said Kansas has always been a leader, often at the center of the national conversation on abortion. It is one of the first states to try to figure out how to operate in the post-Dobbs era, she said.
Lynette Ranney ran the front desk from 2018 to 2023 at the private Overland Park clinic that is a plaintiff in the suit. That was before and after Dobbs, but before Kansas’ restrictions were blocked. She was in charge of ensuring patients had filled out the correct paperwork and that they met all the state requirements. She described in court the anger, frustration and eye rolls from patients toward the state’s long list of requirements.
If patients brought in the required forms in the wrong color or the wrong forms altogether, the 24-hour waiting period would begin again.
“We would have to turn the patient away,” Ranney said. “We would print off new ones, give them their 24-hour timeframe, and try to reschedule them.”
One patient broke a door at the clinic after being turned away for blurry paperwork, Ranney testified
These issues arose at least 10 times a week, she estimated. She said she spent at least seven hours each workday on paperwork. In Ranney’s current role at a skin cancer center, she said, she spends about five minutes on similar tasks.
Once the paperwork and the 24-hour wait were completed, patients then waited an additional 30 minutes from the time they first saw their provider before they could proceed with an abortion. The clinic would set kitchen timers, Ranney said.
Ranney described to the court a patient who traveled to Kansas from Texas. She was seeking an abortion after being subject to sexual assault. When she showed up for the appointment, she brought the wrong consent forms, Ranney said. By the time the clinic could reschedule her appointment, she was too far along in her pregnancy to be seen, she said.
“It was devastating,” Ranney said. “It was so hard to be the person that says, ‘Hey, I know you’ve got a lot going on, but, sorry, we can’t help you.’”
 
National interest
A handful of national groups are involved in the case. On the plaintiff’s side, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Center for Reproductive Rights argued on behalf of Traci Lynn Nauser, a Kansas OB-GYN, her clinic, and Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. On the state’s side, the conservative Christian advocacy firm Alliance Defending Freedom and Colorado-based firm First and Fourteenth.
Allison Pope, an attorney for the alliance and a native Kansan, said in a September press release that the state’s restrictions help women be fully informed about their pregnancies before choosing to get an abortion.
“Informed consent laws make this possible and reflect the longstanding will of the people of Kansas, but Planned Parenthood has made it clear that its goal is to withhold critical information from women,” she said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who is a defendant in the case, said in the alliance’s press release that the state restrictions provide the “best possible care” for Kansas women and children.
“Planned Parenthood has always cared more about its bottom line than women’s health and is actively working to hide important health information from women that could be a matter of life or death,” he said. “We are urging the court to uphold this commonsense protection that prioritizes the lives of women and their children in Kansas.”
Planned Parenthood and other medical organizations across the country have long recognized abortion as reproductive health care.

In a town hall on LGBTQ+ issues hosted by the “Capital Caucus,” a group of state legislators who represent the area around Lansing, legislators seemed focused on their future legislative priorities — priorities that many acknowledged might only be passed if Democrats regain a trifecta. The town hall was hosted Wednesday night at the Central United Methodist Church in downtown Lansing. 
“We try to do what we can and show up where we can. And that may not mean passing a lot of legislation right now, but we sure as hell will be building the case for it,” Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) said. “So as soon as we have the gavel back, we can just start to touch that domino and knock things over, because we need to hold on to the progress that we’ve made.”
Rep. Julie Brixie (D-Okemos) acknowledged the power of still having a Democratic governor, attorney general and state Senate, especially in responding to federal attacks on access to gender-affirming care. 
However, in terms of passing legislation, she expressed similar sentiments to Dievendorf, saying, “I like to view it as a brief holding period for this two year period that we’re in until we can again march forward and move forward in the next cycle when we get our Democratic majority back.”

Others did highlight more recent legislative victories, including the removal of anti-LGBTQ+ language from the Fiscal Year 2026 budget, as Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) emphasized. 
“Some bills are attacking the LGBT community, the trans community, and a lot of the bills, again, they are unenforceable, but they still are an attack on this community, and we can’t let that stand,” Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) continued. 
But while many questions — submitted in advance by attendees and presented by Michigan State doctoral student Sterling Bentley — centered on responding to the Trump administration’s policies rolling back access to gender-affirming care and misinformation about the LGBTQ+ community, many panelists emphasized the need for community engagement and care in response to that. 
“One of the ways that we can combat misinformation that is out there about those of us who identify as queer and trans people is that we have to do the work around supporting our young people,” Jarred Daniels, an implementation specialist at the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health, said.
“I think by raising awareness around these issues, and making sure that our young people have access to sexual health education is going to do so much in the impact of combating misinformation,” Daniels continued. 
And Lilianna Angel Reyes, the Health Equity and Outreach Director at the Ruth Ellis Center in the Detroit area, emphasized that folks with access to education — both formal and informal education — should work to support those without it.

“Cohesion and access to other people and resources increase education access,” she said. 
Later going on to recount her own story as a transgender woman who began transitioning in the early 2000s, Reyes added, “We came from a place that was very, very, very dark, and so I don’t think that we should even fathom that we could go back.”
“I think we will do better when we have more voices that reflect our community, and we’ve definitely had that since Rep. Dievendorf came to the legislature,” added Rep. Kara Hope (D-Holt).
But Amber Moe-Olds, director of movement building at Equality Michigan, shared a somber reminder of what is at stake, calling transgender people the “canary in the coal mine right now for civil rights.”
“The administration is testing how far they can go and what they can get away with using the transgender community right now. And so if we sit silent and we let this happen, we are complicit in losing every other right along the way,” she said.
A point of disagreement came between Dievendorf and Brixie near the end of the panel, in response to labor organizer Bridget McConaughy’s question on how to respond, or not respond, to GOP attacks on trans people. 
Brixie told those in the room not to “take the bait” of having to respond to each attack, attacks that have no legislative potential to pass. 
“It’s easier to take a strategic move of saying we as a caucus are not going to give oxygen to the Republicans’ twentieth hate filled resolution that they pass,” she said. “If we recognize that what they’re doing is just pushing our buttons, and if we don’t react, then it’s not going to be on the news.”
Groups, including the Salus Center, Rooted Counseling and DeWitt Pride all presented information to attendees at the Capitol Caucus LGBTQ+ Town Hall. Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Dievendorf, however, pushed back strongly against this. As the only non-binary member of the legislature, they said, “even when the attacks on us are not in the news, they don’t go away for us.”
“As long as that bill is being introduced, we may not be talking about it, but other folks are,” they continued, referencing the threats that their own office has faced. “That is our opportunity to get in front of the misinformation, correct the lies, and also build community among ourselves, because the attacks were disregarded.”
As the panel came to an end, Daniels added in response to fears about conversion therapy bans being overturned, “Community will be the thing that saves us, no matter when the law is too slow, when justice cannot be found, we will have us. We will save us.”

NSF has awarded UNI a five-year, $4.9 million grant for a new initiative titled “National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program: Midwest Alliance for Rural Elementary Science,” according to a news release.
UNI associate professor Dana Atwood-Blaine will lead researchers from Iowa State University, University of Kansas and University of Minnesota as principal investigator in identifying and providing aid to “outstanding STEM educators working in high-need classrooms.”
“Through this program, we have the opportunity to celebrate and strengthen the work of rural STEM teachers who are making a lasting impact on their students and communities,” Atwood-Blaine said in the release.

The Midwest Alliance universities will select 18 educators “committed to advancing STEM learning” for the initiative, the release stated, who will receive an annual $12,000 stipend for four years as well as opportunities for mentorship and professional development.
Created by NSF after the passage of the CHIPS Act of 2022, the National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program aims to promote STEM education, lift up and support educators in this area and develop career pathways current and future STEM educators will find rewarding.
According to the release, goals of the program beyond supporting individual teachers include creating a “lasting network” of educators and researchers “to strengthen rural elementary science teaching,” using hands-on activities and real-world cases to improve student learning and researching “what works best in training teachers and teaching science in rural schools.”
“The Midwest STEM Alliance will help ensure these teachers receive the recognition, resources and growth opportunities they deserve,” Atwood-Blaine said in the release. “By elevating science instruction that integrates both literacy and math, we’ll help students thrive across subjects and build a lasting foundation for rural science education across the Midwest.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)If I was in charge of the state budget and had just watched $825 million unexpectedly disappear, I suppose I’d try to bluff my way out of this mess, too.
Which is what the Reynolds administration looked like it was doing last week, when the state’s Revenue Estimating Conference said the 2025 fiscal year ended with $300 million less than they’d expected a year ago.
For the current fiscal year, 2026, they’re now anticipating a whopping $525 million less than predicted last October.
I touched on this trend in last week’s post about Iowa’s long-suffering economy, but after I published, the news from the REC got so much worse.
No wonder the ruling party was putting on a brave face and trying to convince Iowans this was all part of the plan. But they’re not very good poker players. Their tells were all over the place.
Take Kraig Paulsen, chairman of the REC who runs the Reynolds administration’s department of management. Federal tax changes will reduce state revenues and, Paulsen conceded, the economy isn’t going as well as they’d like. “Obviously, we are not in a period of (the) state’s most robust growth, but we do continue to see growth,” he said.
Call that a concession, albeit with a big dollop of spin.
In the first quarter of 2025, our GDP didn’t grow. It shrunk. We rebounded somewhat in the second quarter, but the longer-term trend is awful. Last year, the size of Iowa’s economy, when compared with the rest of the states, fell to its lowest ranking in 27 years.
Robust? That word doesn’t belong in the same sentence as the words “Iowa economy.”
Maybe not even in the same paragraph.
Gov. Kim Reynolds claimed revenues were down “just as we projected.” But the steep level of decline the REC now predicts is not what her administration projected, according to documents a Senate Democrat obtained via an open records request earlier this year.
Rep. Gary Mohr, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, tried to shift attention to Joe Biden.
This is a standard play for the GOP when all else fails. But it wasn’t Biden who told Iowa’s ruling party to pass a flat income tax that gave $67,000 to the average millionaire and $600 to the average Iowa family. It wasn’t Biden who told congressional Republicans to pass a budget and tax plan this year that will give the average millionaire $80,000 and then tried to cover it by slashing $1 trillion from Medicaid. And it wasn’t Biden who told them to support a tax on foreign imports that is driving up consumer prices.
That’s on the GOP.

To be clear, watching this much money disappear from the state budget is not what Iowa’s ruling party was expecting when, in the spring of 2024, they accelerated the state’s flat tax to take full effect this year.
Anne Discher, executive director of Common Good Iowa, probably had the most salient reaction to the REC’s new estimates when she said, “If all were proceeding according to plan, one would think they would be meeting their projections, not falling short again and again.”
Exactly.
This is not part of the plan. Instead of facing a $900 million deficit for 2026, which lawmakers expected at the end of the last legislative session, the state now faces a projected $1.3 billion deficit.
That’s 16% of projected general fund revenues. That’s huge.
To put that into perspective, Illinois — whose state budget is roughly six times larger than Iowa’s—has a projected shortfall this year that’s only a fraction of ours, $267 million.
Meanwhile, Illinois’ economy is growing faster than Iowa’s.
It’s true that Iowa has more than $6 billion in reserves, which is a good backup to have. Federal COVID funds, a nationwide economic boost coming out of the pandemic and withholding state spending on healthcare and public education have built up this surplus. Still, Republicans clearly are having to lean on those reserves a lot more than they expected.
Thus, the attempt to bluff you into believing this is all part of the plan.
It’s not. Nowhere in the news stories in 2024 about the Republicans’ mad dash to a flat tax did I read about a projected $1.3 billion deficit.
There’s a reason I didn’t read about it: They weren’t expecting it.
The GOP’s alternate play is to say this is money Iowans no longer have to pay in taxes. And that part is true. But the rich have gobbled up a lot more of that money than you have. That $6 billion budget surplus they’re draining is going to pay for a flat tax that’s stuffing more than $110 into the average millionaire’s pocket for every $1 that you’re getting.
Meanwhile, the GOP has been quietly raising more money each year from sales and excise taxes, which take a bigger percentage out of your income than they do a millionaire’s.
That, my friends, has definitely been part of the plan.
(Source: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy)
The numbers crunchers at the REC now say general fund revenues should rise in 2027 over this year’s projection. But as Discher said, this estimate should be taken with “great caution.” (And even if it turns out to be accurate, it will still be several hundred million dollars less than what the Reynolds administration had anticipated.)
The truth is Iowa’s ruling party is treating the state’s budget like a casino. They bet the farm a top-heavy income tax cut would awaken Iowa’s sleepy economy, and they’re losing. But instead of walking away from the table, they’re letting it ride, betting they’ll hit the jackpot the next hand. Or maybe the one after that. If they don’t? Well, they’ll just keep trying to bluff their way through this mess.
That’s not good for Iowa’s future. It’s time we called their bluff.

That’s according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services in a news release Thursday.
Federal officials also indicated that the shutdown meant a limited availability in funds for the nearly 42 million people across the nation who rely on SNAP. The pause in Michigan SNAP benefits through the month of November was to be in place until further notice, the USDA told the state agency.
The move could place some Michiganders at risk of food insecurity and poverty, the state said.
Nearly 13% of Michigan households, nearly 1.4 million people, receive SNAP benefits, 43% are families with children and 36% are families with members who are older adults or disabled. The state health and human services agency also noted that more than 490,000 children benefit from SNAP resources.
“The impact of households losing SNAP benefits will be felt around the state,” said MDHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel in a statement. “SNAP is more than a food assistance program; it’s a lifeline for many Michigan families. It helps families put nutritious food on the table, supports local farmers and grocers, and strengthens our communities and economy. We are strongly disappointed by the USDA’s decision to delay this assistance, and in Michigan we will do what we can to help blunt this impact.”

(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate upheld Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s veto of a bill that would have expanded the prohibition on electioneering by public employees Thursday.
In vetoing Senate Bill 213, Ayotte said she would be interested in working on strengthening the anti-electioneering law, but pointed to an unrelated section in the bill focused on absentee voting that clashes with a different bill signed into law this year. The Senate unanimously voted to sustain the veto.
SB 213 would have built upon the current ban on electioneering by laying out specific activities that public employees cannot do, as well as those that they can. Current law defines electioneering as a public employee acting “in any way specifically designed to influence the vote of a voter on any question or office” while in the performance of their official duties, but it does not specify those activities. 
The bill states that the prohibition on electioneering includes a public employee distributing or displaying campaign materials, making public statements for or against a candidate, organizing surveys, forums, or events that are political, and using their authority to influence or interfere with a voter’s decision.
But it states that public employees’ participation in parades, fairs, festivals, and other events would not count as electioneering as long as it didn’t favor a candidate. It also clarifies that conducting neutral voter registration drives and election awareness efforts, providing factual information about who is running for office, and informing the public about official functions are activities that do not count as electioneering.
Currently, the anti-electioneering statute applies to anyone employed by a public employer, except those elected by a popular vote, those with duties that “imply a confidential relationship to the public employer,” and those in a probationary or temporary status. Violation of the public electioneering statute could result in a misdemeanor. SB 213 would not have changed that definition or penalty. 
Meanwhile, a separate portion of the bill would have required residents to provide proof of identity, citizenship, age, and domicile when applying for an absentee ballot. Those requirements were already included in Senate Bill 218, which Ayotte signed in August. 
“I am vetoing this legislation as it conflicts with other bills I have recently signed into law regarding absentee ballots,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message Aug. 1. “Additionally, I intend to work with the bill sponsors on the issue of electioneering to ensure that public employees can engage in public discourse without misusing their official positions for political purposes.”
Speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, some Senate Democrats said they opposed the anti-electioneering components in SB 213 as well. Portsmouth Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader, argued the clarifications were unnecessary, and she argued the listed examples of what is and isn’t allowed could create vagueness issues that could violate employees’ 14th Amendment rights.
“In my opinion, this bill was a solution looking for a problem,” she said. “In effect, what our existing law does is sufficient and effective. Our public employees act always with integrity and the highest ethics.”
SB 213 is the only Senate bill vetoed by Ayotte this year; she also vetoed 11 House bills, which the House will take up in its veto session on Dec. 17. 
Under the state constitution, all vetoed bills return first to the legislative chamber in which they originated, and if that chamber votes by a two-thirds majority to overturn the veto, the other chamber also takes it up for a vote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/primaryday2024.png,,,2025-10-23 11:22:05.950589

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) After a week on the defensive explaining controversies unearthed from his past, Graham Platner, the oyster farmer challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins for her seat in 2026, still drew a crowd to his town hall in Ogunquit Wednesday night.
The first public polling on the race also backs up the apparent continued support for the political novice. 
Platner has more than twice the support of Gov. Janet Mills, the Democratic establishment’s pick, among Democratic primary voters, according to the poll released Thursday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which surveyed respondents between Oct. 16 and 21, amid the week of revelations about his past.  
Mills announced her candidacy on Oct. 14, after months of speculation that she would. Days later, the first reports of Platner’s controversial past comments broke, revealing a potential vulnerability as he goes up against seasoned campaigners with national backing. 
Unearthed Reddit comments present first stumble in Platner’s rise

Some of those comments included asking why Black people “don’t tip,” suggesting people wouldn’t get raped if they weren’t inebriated around people they didn’t feel comfortable with, calling rural Americans “racist” and “stupid,” and saying that violence may be necessary to counter facism. Platner apologized in a video posted online, saying he didn’t agree with the comments he made during a time in his life when he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after serving in the military.
Of the 510 likely Democratic primary voters captured in the survey, 58% said they would vote for Platner, 24% for Mills, less than 2% for any other candidate and 14% were undecided. 
Overall, the survey captured 1,100 Maine residents and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. Majorities of self-described socialists, progressives and moderates backed Platner, while a plurality of liberals supported Mills. Platner also showed a wide lead among those ages 18-49, and for those 65 years old and older, Platner and Mills were effectively tied, according to the poll. 
However after that survey period ended, more controversial online statements and reports of his now-covered Nazi-linked tattoo surfaced this week. Platner said he got a tattoo of what he thought was a skull and crossbones while drunk overseas in 2007 with other young Marines. In a social media post on Wednesday, he said he got the tattoo covered on Tuesday, saying he was unaware that it was recognized as a Nazi symbol.
Speaking to the crowd of about 500 in Ogunquit Wednesday night, Platner again acknowledged the tattoo and said, “I do not want something on my body that represents, in any way, the antithesis of my politics.”
Platner also said the revelations about his tattoo and other reports about his past show that “the establishment is spooked.” 
“They’re not trying to get out there and talk about issues,” he said. “They’re trying to figure out if I said something stupid on the internet 13 years ago. If they thought this was going to scare me off … they clearly have not spent a lot of time around Marines.”

McCarron joins a Republican field that includes Secretary of State Wes Allen; Patrick Bishop, a deputy with the Cullman County Sheriff’s Department; Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Rick Pate; former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth. Current Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth is term-limited.
As of Thursday, Allen had over $612,000 on hand for the campaign; Pate had nearly $491,000 and Wadsworth had almost $175,000.
The lieutenant governor presides over the Alabama Senate. The office used to have power comparable to the Speaker of the Alabama House, with the lieutenant governor assigning senators to committees and controlling the flow of legislation. But after a weeks-long standoff in 1999 between then-Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican, and the Democratic-controlled Senate, the powers of the lieutenant governor were transferred to the Senate President Pro Tem.
The lieutenant governor retains some appointment powers and is second-in-line to the governor’s office.
McCarron played for the University of Alabama from 2009 to 2013. He won two national championships during his time with the Crimson Tide. In the 2013 Iron Bowl, he threw a 99-yard pass to receiver Amari Cooper. Auburn won the game on Chris Davis’ “Kick Six” return.

Dray Bourgeois is a multiply disabled, first-generation college graduate from southern Vermont. Raised in a low-income household, he was awarded a Curtis Fund scholarship—support that allowed him to pursue college when the odds were stacked against him, at a time when higher education is increasingly out of reach. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Breaking[...]","Dray Bourgeois is a multiply disabled, first-generation college graduate who clawed his way past everything stacked against him—poverty, disability, doubt, and institutions that were never built for someone like him to succeed. He didn’t just graduate. He broke a cycle.
Across the country, college is costing more every year, while financial aid is getting harder to secure, and federal support increasingly politicized. These shifts hit first-generation, low-income students the hardest.
Before college, Dray’s family of five lived in Bennington and was barely getting by. Then his mother became blind and had to stop working. “We were low-income before,” he says, “but after my mom had to retire, we were really struggling. Two kids going to college at the same time? It just wouldn’t have happened without financial support.”
Dray and his brother are both recipients of a Curtis Fund scholarship. And in a household with no college tradition and limited income, that support helped them reach college and reshaped what their family believed was possible.
“There were so many sacrifices we made just to get by,” he says. He pushed for every bit of merit aid, juggled work and school, and refused to give up on himself, even when the odds were set against him.
“So many of my peers had never known true financial struggle. I felt like I didn’t belong. Like they thought less of me.”  It reminded him just how deeply people underestimate students from backgrounds like his—and how much he had to overcome to prove they were wrong.  
Yet he made it through. Dray earned his degree from Hampshire College and graduated without taking on debt thanks to his scholarship. Now, he’s building a life that once felt out of reach—he’s not living paycheck to paycheck anymore. He’s not putting his physical health at risk just to make rent. “I actually have savings now. I’m planning a wedding and putting money aside for a house, which never even felt possible before. That kind of future used to feel so out of reach.”
And now he’s using that momentum to help others do the same. At VSAC (Vermont Student Assistance Corporation), where he landed his first full-time job right out of college, he guides students through college applications and shows them what’s possible. He’s teaching them that people like them deserve to be in the rooms where futures are decided, because they’ve lived what’s at stake.
Dray was nominated for The Curtis Fund scholarship by his own VSAC counselor, who saw his potential before anyone else did. “She told me I was going to college. She wasn’t going to let me not go,” he remembers. When she called to tell him he’d received the award from The Curtis Fund, it was the first time it felt real. “It was a relief, but also this wave of possibility. Like maybe I could actually do this.”
Now Dray’s planning to pursue a master’s degree, potentially in special education, a field that overlaps with his current outreach work. And the ripple effect is clear: his parents, who never had the chance to attend college themselves, have been empowered by what Dray and his brother learned. “It’s even helped them make better financial decisions,” he says.
The Curtis Fund connects Vermonters with the access, support, and belief they need to pursue education, change what’s possible, and build a stronger future—for themselves, their families, and our state.
Community-based solutions are more vital now than ever. With federal aid being gutted, student debt climbing, and political attacks on public education accelerating, Dray is clear: “This is bigger than me. Some people will always have a way in. But for students like me, this kind of support is the only way forward.”
“It’s community-driven support like this that actually makes a difference,” he says. “Not with noise or performative policy, but by meeting people where they are and helping them move forward — for real.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A new coalition of food security advocates and organizations sent a letter to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Wednesday evening asking her to fully fund the nation’s largest food benefit program in November. 
The letter, which was signed by six different organizations, comes after an announcement earlier in the week that those who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP,  won’t receive their benefits in November due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
“As Maine’s Senior Senator and Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, we call on you to support the immediate release of SNAP’s contingency funds to pay for partial SNAP benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown,” the letter says. 
More than one in 10 Mainers throughout the state rely on these benefits, but the need is markedly higher in Androscoggin, Aroostook, Piscataquis, Somerset and Washington counties. In total, just shy of 170,000 Mainers receive SNAP benefits. They are among the more than 42 million Americans across the country who rely on the program. 
If the funds aren’t released, SNAP recipients won’t receive vital food assistance, the letter argued, and farmers and grocers will be without revenue. On average, a family of four in Maine who receives SNAP benefits gets $572 per month.
“During a season when many people celebrate with food, Maine’s poorest households will be wondering where their next meal is coming from and looking to local food pantries and non-profits who cannot fill the enormous gaps left by federal funding,” the letter reads.
The letter is signed by Preble Street, Maine Children’s Alliance, Full Plates Full Potential, Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets, Maine Equal Justice and the Maine Center for Economic Policy. 
Collins’ office did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates SNAP, has about $6 billion in a multi-year contingency fund. That’s short of the roughly $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.
Nearly 170,000 Mainers won’t receive SNAP benefits in November due to government shutdown

Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means benefits would likely be delayed.
The shortfall is caused by the shutdown, which hit its 22nd day Wednesday. The fund is supposed to maintain a balance of about $9 billion, but $3 billion of the funds expired at the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30. Because Congress has not approved the next year’s funding, the fund only has $6 billion.
USDA would have to come up with the remaining $3 billion. The department could try something similar to its shuffle of more than $300 million in tariff revenue into its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, through the rest of the month. 
It’s unclear if USDA plans to use the SNAP contingency fund or any other maneuvers to extend benefits.
Nearly 40% of the 42 million SNAP recipients nationwide are children 17 and younger, according to the USDA. About 20% are seniors aged 60 and older and the remaining 40% are adults aged 18 to 59.
USDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment from States Newsroom.
Parties in Congress remained nowhere near a deal to end the shutdown as of Wednesday.

Laura Kelly takes part in a news conference Oct. 22, 2025, to announce funding of nine transportation infrastructure projects requiring investment of $442 million through 2030. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly added nine highway expansion and modernization projects valued at $442 million to Kansas’ transportation pipeline.
The announcement in Lindsborg on Wednesday represented the fourth round of projects in the state’s 10-year Eisenhower Legacy Transportation Program adopted by the Kansas Legislature and signed into law by Kelly. The location was chosen because the roster of projects included reconstruction of Kansas 4 and Bethany Drive to create a more functional entrance to the city from I-135.
The $11 million project, with a contract scheduled to be awarded in 2029, would remove an aging bridge to eliminate the need for maintenance at the location.
Kelly said the IKE program had proven to be a powerful engine for economic growth and represented a commitment to build a stronger, safer Kansas.
“Since the program’s inception, we have worked diligently to advance important infrastructure modernization and expansion projects to the construction stage, ensuring a safe, prosperous future for Kansans in rural, suburban and urban communities across the state,” she said.
The most expensive project in this round would be replacement in 2028 of Centennial Bridge with a $157 million, four-lane structure in Leavenworth County. In 2029, the state also plans to proceed with $120 million in interchange improvements on Kansas 96 at Rock Road and Woodlawn Road in Sedgwick County.
The Kansas Department of Transportation committed to a $43 million project in 2030 for construction of an interchange at Kansas 10 and Lone Elm Road in Johnson County.
In 2029, KDOT said it would allocate $35 million to create passing lanes on U.S. 169 in Anderson and Allen counties. The agency said southwest Kansas would benefit from $33 million in passing lanes on U.S. 83 in Finney and Scott counties.
Other projects included $17 million to rebuild U.S. 281 in Russell and Osborne counties in 2028. In addition, $15 million would be invested in reconstructing Kansas 33 in Douglas County and $11 million to upgrade K-33 in Franklin County during 2030.
KDOT Secretary Calvin Reed said improvements in transportation infrastructure depended on development of local project partnerships.
“Communities across the state recognize the benefits that a well-planned and funded transportation system brings,” Reed said. “When we listen to and collaborate with Kansans directly, we can have confidence that these investments will deliver meaningful and long-lasting benefits for all.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Laura-Kelly-on-KDOT-funding-1024x681.png,,,2025-10-23 10:24:01.580390

(Jeremy Stevens for Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana tribal casino is under the scrutiny of at least two federal agencies, according to documents the Illuminator has obtained and a former casino purchasing manager who says authorities have interviewed her twice about the matter.
The probe involves Jonathan Cernek, former chairman of the Coushatta Tribe, who federal regulators allege used a casino business credit card to build and furnish his personal home. A former tribal official said the controversy has raised questions about fairness and accountability over how leaders spend casino proceeds intended to benefit all its members.  
The National Indian Gaming Commission ordered the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission last month to suspend the license of Todd Stewart, the casino’s former general manager and chief financial officer, because of an alleged failure to report suspected misuse of gaming revenues during Cernek’s tenure. The federal commission has ordered the tribe to hold a revocation hearing for Stewart. 
Claims of Cernek’s credit card misuse are outlined in an eight-page statement Stewart provided to the Coushatta Tribal Council last year. The Illuminator has obtained a copy of the letter. Although he initially did not respond to questions from a reporter, Stewart confirmed via email Tuesday that he wrote the statement.
Dated Aug. 14, 2024, Stewart’s statement details events dating back to November 2023. They include Stewart’s discovery of invoices for deliveries to the home of Cernek and his wife, Mandy, citing “bathroom fixtures” as an example. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Stewart wrote that he reported the purchases to other members of the tribe’s leadership council and eventually confronted Cernek about the credit card spending. In response, Stewart alleged in his statement that the former chairman threatened his job.
Stewart also wrote that he spoke with former casino purchasing manager Paula Corliss about Cernek’s credit card use. She explained the account was for community goodwill purchases, such as air conditioning units for tribal elders and gift baskets for graduating tribal members, according to Stewart.
In his statement, Stewart said Corliss confirmed “there were at least a few instances where Mandy Cernek placed orders [using the credit card] with product delivered to the Cernek residence.”
In a recent interview with the Illuminator, Corliss confirmed these details, adding that she believed “nothing was hidden” about the Cerneks’ use of the casino credit card.
“It was there for him [Stewart] to see, for the council to see, everybody in finance,” Corliss said. “It was there. You could see it. No one addressed it with the chairman. No one, and Todd said he would handle it.”
Jonathan and Mandy Cernek did not respond to phone or text messages requesting an interview, nor did the Cerneks respond to a list of questions the Illuminator hand-delivered to their home in Calcasieu Parish.
Stewart initially did not respond to phone or email messages. After a reporter hand-delivered a letter with a list of specific questions to Stewart’s residence in Henderson, Nevada, on Sept. 27, he sent a brief email statement.
“Throughout my tenure with the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, I have discharged the duties of my position with professional integrity and have worked with the stakeholders for the betterment of the Coushatta Casino Resort. That has defined my tenure,” Stewart wrote.
Corliss told the Illuminator the FBI questioned her in person in late May 2024 about Coushatta Casino’s finances. She also said she spoke with someone from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs over the phone in late October 2024.
The tribe’s current chairman, David Sickey, and tribal council members Crystal Williams and Kristian Poncho did not respond to phone and text message requests for interviews for this report. The tribe’s public relations representative, Mary Patricia Wray, did not respond to an emailed list of questions.
In response to a list of questions about the Coushatta Tribe, the FBI said it is limiting its responses to the news media during the federal government shutdown. Typically, as a matter of policy, the FBI neither confirms nor denies the status of its investigations.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to questions about its involvement with the Coushatta Tribe. Its website indicates the agency’s services are impacted in the ongoing shutdown.
The National Indian Gaming Commission has previously said it does “not comment on ongoing investigations, or potential investigations.”
Tribe awaits explanation
Jonas John, the Coushatta Tribe’s former heritage and cultural department director, said he clashed with the former chairman over financial matters before Cernek forced him from his role. It happened two years ago after John said he spoke out about a dormant tribal museum project. He said he was given a termination notice and told he could either resign or be fired. 
“This was direct from [former] Chairman Cernek and his administrator, Chris Langley,” John told the Illuminator.
John said he asked for a reason for his termination, and human resources told him they wanted a change and no longer needed his services.
“I was shocked due to the fact I have given so much to our tribe in revitalization of tribal culture, which people still benefit [from] today …” John said. “Sometimes, if you start questioning our department’s grant money and tribal issues, this is what happens.”.  
“We built the casino to help our people and the local community grow, but that takes honesty and good leadership,” John said.
Coushatta Tribe’s next generation warns against risk from carbon sequestration

John said tribal community meetings with its leadership are infrequent, and there has been no public explanation from the tribal council about the alleged credit card misuse or other financial issues.  
“Our museum has never been developed,” John said. “There’s a $13 million building back there that there is nothing accountable for, and I wanted accountability. I asked, ‘Where did these funds go? Why is our museum like a skeleton?’ You know, it’s just there.”
John said many members want to replace the bylaws that govern the Coushatta Tribe. 
“We need a constitution that will prevent people from stealing and misusing funds,” he said. “Without that, nothing changes.”
The Coushatta Tribe is a federally recognized sovereign nation with more than 900 enrolled members. Its casino is under federal and state oversight, with its operations defined in a tribal-state compact. That agreement establishes the tribe’s reporting, financial oversight and regulatory obligations the tribe must follow to maintain its gaming license. 
The National Indian Gaming Commission regulates and monitors all tribal casinos through the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. It issued the order to suspend Stewart’s license after investigating a complaint from an unspecified source about Cernek’s misusing casino revenues, according to a notice the federal agency sent to Pam Bass, chairwoman of the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission.
Like Louisiana’s other tribal casinos, the Coushatta have their own gaming commission that serves as the establishment’s primary state regulator. But its members must report investigations, disciplinary actions and compliance data to the Louisiana State Police.
State Police can enforce state and federal laws and investigate violations that occur in connection with the Coushatta Casino Resort, according to a compact between the state and the tribe. State Police are required to share their investigation reports with the tribe, according to the compact that applies only to the tribe’s gaming operations, not its governmental affairs.
There was no response from State Police to questions for this report before publication.
Tribes must keep six years of independent audits and must provide audit and accounting records to State Police for review or copying upon request. It was these audits that first brought to light issues with the tribe’s credit card spending. 
Last month, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor published a report from one of the independent audits that indicated the Coushatta tribe’s leadership did not keep track of credit card use, with no receipts to show for purchases totaling more than $100,000 over a two-month spending period in 2024 that was reviewed. 
Shawna Castellano, a regional director with the National Indian Gaming Commission, wrote in the Sept. 8 order calling for Stewart’s license to be pulled that the audit confirmed claims made in the complaint filed with the commission.
A comparable Coushatta Casino Resort audit from 2023 was recently published on the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s website. It found 338 transactions totaling $111,697 with no receipts over the two-month review period. 
Statement reveals discrepancies
Stewart’s written statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council provides his version of events surrounding Jonathan Cernek’s credit card use. 
In late January and early February 2024 meetings, Stewart said Corliss told him that, on one occasion, one of the casino’s purchasing credit cards was flagged by the bank for suspicious activity, and she ordered a replacement. Not long after receiving the new credit card, it was missing from her desk, Stewart wrote, adding that Corliss suspected Cernek had entered her office after hours to take it.
Corliss told Stewart the former chairman had a master key, according to Stewart’s statement. 
“Soon after I instructed Paula to cancel the purchasing credit card, she called me to advise that there was no need to cancel the credit card as The [former] Chairman had physically returned it,” Stewart wrote.
Corliss confirmed this claim with the Illuminator, stating that Cernek took the card in more than one instance, and sometimes sent her a text message afterward to say he had the card before returning it.
In his email Tuesday to the Illuminator, Stewart said an earlier report mischaracterized the situation.  
“Contrary to your previous reporting, my statement opens with a clear knowledge of those in possession of credit cards,” he wrote.
Audit shows Coushatta Tribe didn’t track credit card use

According to Stewart’s statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council, he met with Kristian Poncho, the Coushatta Tribe’s secretary-treasurer, in mid-February 2024 to discuss Cernek’s credit card spending. Stewart told Poncho “any potential ‘bleeding’ had been stopped and we were therefore dealing with historical activity that had already occurred.”
At the time, Stewart wrote, he was focused on reaching a credit agreement with Wells Fargo for a $150 million casino renovation and hotel expansion project. He was also finalizing a related contract with Yates Construction and his work on the 2023 audit, which would later raise concerns about missing receipts. 
By Feb. 21, 2024, Stewart and his team briefed the Coushatta Tribal Council on the casino’s finances. The Wells Fargo deal closed March 11, and the Yates contract followed on March 27. Expansion work began at the resort that month. 
The 2023 audit, Stewart wrote, was finalized and issued on April 25, 2024, with “no significant or material deficiencies reported.”
According to Castellano’s notice to the Coushatta Tribe last month, the National Indian Gaming Commission interviewed Stewart this past June and learned he did not “disclose suspected fraud to the external auditors during the [fiscal year] 2023 annual audit of the financial statements.” 
Stewart also didn’t discuss the matter with “the potential lender of a $150 million construction loan the Coushatta Casino was in the process of obtaining” until the loan was actually secured, Castellano wrote.
“The audited financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2023, and 2024
were issued by the external auditors with an unqualified (clean) opinion,” Stewart told the Illuminator this week.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
‘A tensity in the air’
Stewart also said in his written statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council that Jonathan Cernek asked him to join him for dinner alone on April 30, 2024, at Simon’s Bar & Grill, on an out-of-the-way stretch of Highway 397 southeast of Lake Charles. 
“We met at an isolated venue …” Stewart wrote. “There was a tensity in the air when we begin to interact, and I struggled to carry the conversation for over an hour.”
Stewart wrote that their conversation remained strained until Cernek suddenly asked why Stewart had been “asking people how a chairman can be impeached.” 
Stewart explained that a tribal elder had accused the Cerneks of stealing from the tribe and that he was only trying to figure out his own job security, according to the statement.
The chairman told Stewart that he “had had his back” many times and wanted to know that he was loyal, according to Stewart’s statement.
Feds order Coushatta casino to suspend former GM for not disclosing fraud concerns

Cernek resigned without explanation as tribal chairman Aug. 9, 2024, less than a week before Stewart prepared his statement for the Coushatta Tribal Council.
“It appears that there is an attempt to hold me, the non-tribal member, accountable for the inappropriate actions of the Chairman, a Tribal member,” Stewart wrote to the Illuminator this week.
When the Illuminator reported last month on the audit findings, Wray said the tribal council had eliminated its purchasing credit cards and adopted a formal expense reporting and reimbursement policy.
The Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission was given 45 days to hold a hearing on Stewart’s license revocation and report back to the National Indian Gaming Commission on its decision. As of mid-October, there’s been no date set for Stewart’s hearing.
On his LinkedIn page, Stewart listed this past Sept. 7 as his last day as general manager at Coushatta Casino Resort.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coushatta-sign-cropped-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-10-23 10:24:01.580390

University of Alaska President Pat Pitney appointed Siemers as interim chancellor in May of this year. Pitney announced that after reviewing four candidates for chancellor through a hiring search, as well as community and stakeholder feedback, she decided that extending Siemers’ appointment would “provide institutional stability.”

“I appreciate the hard work of all four finalist candidates to engage with and get to know our university community, and I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who participated in the search process and shared their perspectives,” President Pitney said in a statement with the announcement. 
“Cheryl is uniquely positioned to continue advancing UAA’s priorities without pause, and I am pleased to share that she has agreed to extend her appointment. This decision ensures continuity and sustained progress as UAA continues to build on its strengths and pursue its strategic goals,” she said.
The four frontrunner candidates visited the campus in September and participated in candidate forums and engagement events. They were Diane Hirshberg, director of UAA Institute of Social and Economic Research; Aaron Dotson, UAA vice chancellor for research; Jennifer Capps, California Polytechnic University Humboldt provost and vice president of Academic Affairs; John Ballard, president of National Intelligence University.
Jonathon Taylor, UA director of communications, said by email Wednesday that all four candidates were qualified and generally received positive feedback from their campus visits. “However, the overwhelming consensus from the community and stakeholder feedback was that Interim Chancellor Siemers has been an excellent leader for UAA and that the stability maintained by keeping her in that role would be beneficial to the institution,” he said. “Given that and the lack of unified consensus in the stakeholder and community feedback behind any one of the four finalists, President Pitney opted to extend Interim Chancellor Siemers’ appointment, which she accepted.”
Siemers stepped into the interim chancellor role after former chancellor and former governor Sean Parnell announced his retirement after four years in January. She previously served as the director of UAA’s Kenai Peninsula College. She joined the college in 2002, and taught as an adjunct then full-time faculty member in the Department of English, then as assistant director before becoming director of the college. She holds a master’s in English from UAA and a Ph.D. in rhetoric and linguistics from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
Siemers will continue as interim chancellor of UAA, overseeing the Anchorage campus, Kenai Peninsula College, Kodiak College, Matanuska-Susitna College, and Prince William Sound College, and a budget of roughly $333 million. 
Taylor said the search for a chancellor has concluded for now, adding that “President Pitney will evaluate how she would like to proceed with the UAA Chancellor role on a longer-term basis in 2026 once the ongoing search for a permanent UAF Chancellor concludes.”

For low-income and minority communities that face barriers to voter registration, health care facilities can offer a solution: making civic engagement easier by reaching people where they are.
Registries of motor vehicles, or RMVs, are currently a main location for voter registration. The National Voter Registration Act, nicknamed the “Motor Voter Act,” requires RMVs to offer automatic voter registration, making the process seamless for new Massachusetts residents getting driver’s licenses or registering their cars. But low-income and immigrant individuals are less likely to drive and own a car, and therefore many may never visit the RMV. These communities have disproportionately low voter registration rates.
But where does nearly everyone visit? Hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. In 2023, 96 percent of Massachusetts residents reported visiting at least one health care provider in the past year. And the halls of our hospitals are filled with millions of visitors. These spaces are under-tapped resources that should offer voter registration to the vast, diverse people that they serve.
It’s also the law. Just as the National Voter Registration Act requires voter registration assistance at RMVs, it also requires it at state-run hospitals (and other offices) that offer public assistance. The reason? To ensure that those who may not visit the RMV—but may seek resources like health care through MassHealth and SNAP’s food benefits—are also afforded their right to access the ballot box. 
But Massachusetts’s public hospitals, whose social work offices offer public assistance, are currently not complying with this federal law. And because public hospitals primarily serve minority and low-income individuals who are already less likely to be registered voters, this failure makes their disproportionate disenfranchisement even worse. Boston-based legal organization Lawyers for Civil Rights is putting pressure on the Commonwealth to come into compliance. With other election reforms like same-day voter registration gaining momentum, Massachusetts should satisfy its existing legal obligations under the National Voter Registration Act as well.
Private health care facilities can also give voting support in addition to medical support. Just as quality improvement measures have been successfully integrated across health care systems, voter registration services can be seamlessly incorporated into routine patient care. And bringing voter registration into health care facilities isn’t just a smart use of existing resources, but it also has snowballing benefits. 
Health care systems have long recognized that addressing social determinants of health, including civic engagement, can dramatically improve patient outcomes. When patients have accessible pathways to register to vote while receiving care, we’re not just treating their immediate health needs, but empowering them to advocate for policies that affect their long-term well-being. This represents the kind of systematic, evidence-based approach to health care improvement that can benefit both individual patients and entire communities.
The registration deadline for this November’s election is fast approaching — on October 25. Massachusetts can register many more voters by that time — and that would especially be the case if public hospitals were to offer the required voter registration assistance and private health care facilities stepped up to join this effort. 
Let’s meet people where they already are—doctors’ offices and emergency rooms—to improve patients’ health and the health of our democracy.

Local leaders, hospital staff, and residents say they are a testament to the devastation that lingers after communities lose their critical infrastructure.","IN JANUARY 2024, Gov. Maura Healey’s administration launched the Advancing Health Equity in Massachusetts initiative to address health disparities across the Commonwealth. 
Ten geographic areas encompassing 30 communities were targeted after being found to have the greatest health inequities in relation to the two leading causes of premature death in Massachusetts. Dorchester and Ayer were among those communities.  
Six months later, the administration said it could not stop their local hospitals from closing.  
The news came not long after the announcement of Steward Health Care’s bankruptcy – a financial mismanagement scandal that led to the widely covered demise of one of the country’s largest for-profit hospital chains. Steward operated eight hospitals in Massachusetts, and in the summer of 2024, its executives made deals with the state to sell the facilities. But the crisis renewed calls to end private equity ownership of health care. 
The Healey administration helped five of Steward’s hospitals transition to new operators, but Nashoba Valley Medical Center – located in the rural North-Central town of Ayer – and Carney Hospital – located in Dorchester, Boston’s largest neighborhood – were left to close, leaving many to question why the state couldn’t have done more. (Steward’s eighth facility, Norwood Hospital, has been closed since it flooded in 2020.)  
Just over one year later, those regions are grappling with strained EMS services, diminished access to care, and trust that has been broken. Local leaders, hospital staff, and residents say they are a testament to the devastation that lingers after communities lose their critical infrastructure. 
“If you talk to most people out here, they feel abandoned, let down, hurt,” Ayer Town Manager Robert Pontbriand said. “There was a failure of leadership and commitment to this region, and people are hurting on all levels. They have very long memories.”

A 2024 Boston Globe investigation detailed an “often-accommodating relationship that long persisted between Steward executives and state regulators.” For years, state officials did not discipline the hospital chain for its regulatory violations, scrutinize its insistent expansion plans and cost-cutting efforts, or respond as it headed toward financial ruin.  
Healey has since touted that her administration “saved” five of Steward’s hospitals, while also claiming that Carney and Nashoba Valley – where 71 and 65 percent of patient revenue came from Medicaid and Medicare, respectively – were out of their hands. She attributed the closures to the “greed and mismanagement” of Steward’s leaders and financial partners, arguing that the state lacked the authority to prevent it. Steward claimed there weren’t any qualified bids for the two hospitals as there were for the other five.  
The administration committed some $835 million to the nonprofit buyers of the other Steward hospitals over three years – $72 million in subsidies to keep the hospitals open during the bankruptcy, $66 million for the eminent domain taking of St. Elizabeth’s, and $697 million in ongoing operator support – which helped them meet their bids. The total cost to the state is expected to be $360 million after recoupment and federal reimbursement, according to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services.  
The state provided supplemental payments through MassHealth and advanced some of the Medicaid program funds the hospitals would have received anyway. But, it is unclear if federal Medicaid cuts will impact the reimbursements anticipated by the administration. 
Steward had neglected investment and upgrades in its facilities for years, adding to the challenge of finding new hospital networks to purchase them. But there were bids for both Carney and Nashoba Valley, and without an explanation of why those deals fell through, the public has been left to speculate.  
State Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who represents the Middlesex and Worcester district encompassing Ayer, claims he spoke with executives at St. Joseph’s Hospital, owned by Covenant Health and based in New Hampshire, who were interested in acquiring Nashoba Valley last year and had been in talks with the Office of Health and Human Services. Eldridge says the state didn’t offer enough support to make that purchase viable for St. Joseph’s.  
Covenant Health and St. Joseph’s did not respond to a request for comment.  
Additionally, it was reported that UMass Memorial Health had been in talks with the state and submitted an offer for Nashoba Valley, but the property owner and private equity giant, New York City-based Apollo Global Management, declined it. “I think the question goes back to – what was the financial offer from the state to make that deal happen?” Eldridge said. “We still don’t really know.”  
UMass Memorial and Apollo declined to comment on the purchase offer. 
The Globe reported in August 2024 that Insight Health Systems, a physician-owned system operating hospitals for low-income residents in Michigan and Illinois, made bids for all of Steward’s hospitals in Massachusetts, including Carney and Nashoba Valley, which Steward rejected as not qualified. Insight declined to comment.  
Residents, hospital staff, and other state and local leaders from the Nashoba Valley and Dorchester regions recognize Steward as the culprit in the death of their hospitals but say they feel betrayed by the Healey administration. Pontbriand noted signs posted throughout the town of Ayer that read, “No hospital 2024, no Healey 2026.”

“There’s a great deal of anger, mostly directed at the Healey-Driscoll administration, but I would say at legislators too,” Eldridge said. “Until a hospital comes back, I think it’s going to be really hard to repair that damage and lack of faith in government.” 
Steward determined whether the bids were qualified. But the Healey administration still has not answered a litany of questions from both CommonWealth Beacon and other news organizations about what they could have reasonably done to prevent the potential deals from falling through, and it remains unclear whether the state could have attracted and convinced potential, qualified buyers to place bids on Carney and Nashoba Valley by offering funding upfront.  
The administration has appeared invested in the deals of the other five hospitals, particularly through its seizure of St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton by eminent domain, which kept the hospital open after Apollo rejected the state’s low-ball offer of $4.5 million. The administration took control of the property and transitioned its operations to Boston Medical Center. Apollo sued, and the state ultimately agreed to pay $66 million for the property in a settlement, according to HHS. 
“We know how difficult the loss of Nashoba Valley Medical Center and Carney Hospital were to their communities,” a spokesperson from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services said in a statement. “Over the last year we have continued to monitor and assess the communities’ access to health care services.” 
In 2024, the city of Boston’s tax records listed Carney Hospital’s assessed property value at $76 million, though the market-rate value was likely much higher. Nashoba Valley was assessed at just over $17 million. The two facilities together employed nearly 1,250 people and saw around 23,000 patients in their emergency departments in 2023. 
“You have all these hospitals in crisis. We just wanted the same consideration as others,” Pontbriand said, adding that it seemed the decision not to save the hospital had already been made. As the North-Central region continues to grow, he says the need for services will rise.  
“A wound still healing”  
Dozens of former nurses, doctors, secretaries, and emergency room staff from Nashoba Valley Medical Center gathered in the parking lot of the shuttered, abandoned building on August 31, exactly one year after the hospital closed. They dubbed it their first annual employee picnic.  
There were lighthearted moments, like their yankee swap of old memorabilia from the hospital – parking lot signs, a wall phone, old magazines. They spent the evening catching up on each other’s new jobs and trading old stories from their time at the hospital until it got dark.  
But it was hard to forget why they were there.

“It was very bittersweet to see how much our lives have changed in one year,” said former Nashoba Valley nurse Audra Sprague, who worked at the hospital for 17 years. “Something you put so much work into, and you think is so solid, can be taken away in an instant.” 
After the 60-year-old hospital closed its doors last year, Ayer Fire Chief Tim Johnston said many in the largely working class, rural community still had hope that the doomed hospital could reopen. But after a year of driving by an empty building, he says the outlook is more dismal.  
“We’re a year out, and I guess we realize that the hospital is not coming back,” he said.  
In the last year, his small emergency response team has frequently had to call for mutual aid and backup, often when they receive additional calls while all their immediate staff are already out on duty. He said 70 percent of their patients used to go to NVMD. But because Ayer ambulances are being driven further distances to surrounding hospitals, responders are away from the station for extended periods of time.  
“You’re taken out of your service area, and what used to be a 40-minute turnaround is anywhere from an hour or two at best,” he said. “It’s been certainly challenging for a small town, because we just don’t come up with additional labor and manpower.” 
Speaking at an April budget hearing, then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh said the 77-bed facility was an “empty community hospital that people just weren’t using.” 
The decision that it was a non-essential hospital – by who? Spreadsheets?Ayer Town Manager Robert Pontbriand
In its 2024 closure documents, Steward reported average daily census counts that made Nashoba Valley’s patient volume appear low. Steward had been pulling services and staff for months before the hospital closure, according to Sprague, which forced them to transfer more patients and contributed to seemingly low census numbers. 
But many decried that the daily census measure only counted patients who were admitted to the hospital and did not include outpatient surgeries or emergency room patients who were transferred or not admitted (both of which were reported separately), nor did it include those who only received medical imaging services at the hospital.  
Sprague pointed to Steward’s closure documents filed in bankruptcy court estimating that the number of patients at Nashoba Valley was 31 as of July 15, 2024. Emergency room staff, according to Sprague, determined that 42 patients were seen in the ER alone that day, along with hospital data showing that 37 patients were treated in hospital units other than the emergency department. 
“The decision that it was a non-essential hospital – by who? Spreadsheets?” Pontbriand said.

Most of Ayer’s EMS transports and patients now go to UMass Memorial Health’s Leominster campus or Emerson Hospital in Concord, which are approximately 15 and 17 miles away from Nashoba Valley Medical Center. Travel times can be much longer for patients coming from their homes outside of Ayer. For those living in Pepperell, who used to be seen at Nashoba Valley, travelling to Leominster or Emerson is approximately a 20-mile, 40-minute drive. 
What started as cracks before the hospital closed soon became deep fissures, Pontbriand said. 
Given the traffic on Route 2, ambulance response times can be much longer. Leominster Hospital was already strained before the closure, with emergency departments in the UMass system hitting unprecedented levels in 2024. Dr. Eric Dickson, president and CEO of UMass Memorial, told Spectrum News last year before the closure that the state’s average daily census had reached 860 while the system only had 750 beds. 
“If someone had a serious medical emergency, you might not have the ability to save that person’s life if you’re driving a half an hour or 40 minutes to Emerson Hospital in Concord, or to Leominster Hospital, or to Worcester,” Eldridge said.   
Sprague, an ER nurse who now works at UMass Memorial’s Clinton Hospital about 15 miles from Nashoba Valley, estimates they are at critical capacity nearly 75 percent of the time. She recently worked four hours past the end of her shift. After being over capacity all day, she said she didn’t feel comfortable leaving two nurses and one doctor with 10 patients in the waiting room and 16 in ER beds.  
Emerson’s emergency room visits spiked 24 percent in July compared to July 2024, according to data from DPH. At Clinton, visits were up nearly 11 percent. 
Code Help – a surge plan that every hospital in the state is required to have to address emergency room crowding – has become the norm, according to both Sprague and Leominster emergency room secretary Shelly Roy, who said it has gotten worse since the closure. 
“Every other day we’re in a Code Help,” Roy said. “They don’t really amount to much except words.”

Roy, who previously worked as the ER secretary at Nashoba Valley, said she often sees 15 to 20 patients in their waiting room in Leominster. In one night, the emergency department received 32 ambulance deliveries. She said it was the worst she has seen. 
The influx of patients means people are waiting longer to receive treatment or diagnoses, according to Roy, who said their CAT scan services were recently backed up nearly six hours.  
“Now something that should take a couple of hours or even half an hour to diagnose is taking a lot longer because of all the wait times and people that are in the ER,” she said. “It’s a very big deal when people’s lives are lost because they’re not diagnosed fast enough.” 
The average length of stay at Health Alliance’s emergency departments was just over six hours as of March, according to a Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis database. Roy said she often sees patients waiting six to eight hours.  
Prior to the closure, the region’s median ambulance transport times were mostly aligned with those of the rest of the state. Post closure, that time increased from 12 to 17 minutes for emergency calls, according to a Nashoba Valley Health Planning Working Group report published in March. 
There used to be a primary and a backup ambulance in Ayer – both of which have now become primary vehicles. With the addition of a medic truck, Johnston said they don’t have enough staff to operate all three at once. In one weekend in August, the team of four transported patients to a total of seven different hospitals in the region.  
“They’ve lost a big piece of what gave them comfort – having a hospital in their area,” Johnston said. “Now … they’re never sure where we’re going to take them.”  
The added strain has put wear and tear on the vehicles, but most of all, EMS staff are overwhelmed because of staffing shortages that existed even before the closure. 
“EMTs, paramedics – they’re getting tired,” Pontbriand said. “This small regional hospital served 17 rural communities of the Nashoba Valley. It filled a key gap.”

Regional leaders estimated it would cost $9.6 million to sustain their emergency response systems over the next 2 years, according to a formal request sent to Healey’s office in December 2024 and signed by 13 fire chiefs, 11 town and city managers, and the state legislative delegation representing the Nashoba Valley region. The Legislature ultimately provided a $5 million earmark for the communities affected by Nashoba Valley’s closure in the supplemental budget signed by the governor this summer. That funding was part of a $10 million allocation to support EMS statewide.  
Those communities have yet to see that funding, and how it will be distributed among the Nashoba Valley region hasn’t been announced. In 2024, DPH also provided $2 million in capital grants for EMS providers throughout the Nashoba Valley region that was split among eight towns.  
While helpful, Pontbriand says it doesn’t replace the loss of a hospital.  
“We knew that the stress on the emergency response system out here was going to be considerable on two levels, both in terms of response time, but also cost,” Pontbriand said. “The towns out here are not rich towns.”  
Nashoba Valley was also one of the area’s largest employers, and nearly 500 jobs were lost. 
At Leominster Hospital, Johnston said they often encounter other ambulances from local towns like Shirley and Groton that would have previously gone to Nashoba Valley.  
“They just don’t have a bed ready for all the patients, so we end up going up against the wall and waiting for them to get a bed available. Sometimes this can be extended periods of time, so more than 15 or 20 minutes,” he said. “It could be peak periods when we get there, and there’s six or seven ambulances.”

The region has already been hit hard by other hospital closures. Fitchburg’s Burbank Hospital, dating back to 1890, closed in 1997. UMass Memorial closed its pediatric unit at Leominster Hospital in 2018 and its maternity unit in 2023. And Community Healthlink, an affiliate of UMass Memorial, is set to shut down another program in October that provides mental health services for adults in Fitchburg after recently closing two primary care programs – one in Leominster in September 2024 and another in Worcester in March. 
After the closure, it took Sprague months to find an available endocrinologist to treat her son with Type 1 diabetes. Her parents, age 84, lost access to their endocrinologist, neurologist, and orthopedist.

Rural communities like Ayer with fewer surrounding facilities are likely to be worse off when hospitals close, according to Jose Figueroa, associate professor of health policy at Harvard’s School of Public Health.  
“It tends to worsen your underlying chronic diseases if you delay access to care, whether the delay is because you have to switch to a new doctor or travel longer,” Figueroa said. “It impairs your ability to ensure you’re on the right medications. It impairs your ability to get testing that might dictate whether your treatment regimen should be changed.” 
The consequences of switching or delaying care are much worse for older adults who are more likely to suffer from chronic underlying conditions, functional limitations, and cognitive impairment, he added. Research suggests that older adults are more likely to struggle finding new providers and are more likely to have been in a long-standing relationship with one doctor. A lack of continuous, trusted care is a cause for concern, as delays can result in a need to be hospitalized for treatment, Figueroa said. 
More than half of older Americans now get their Medicare coverage through an insurance company’s Medicare Advantage plan, which often have restrictions on where a patient can receive care that is covered. 
“If there’s a hospital that was within network of your current plan and then it closes, not only do you have to figure out who’s the nearest provider that can take care of your problem, but are they within network?” Figueroa said. 
“The market has spoken.” 
Jane McInerny, a 69-year-old retiree with multiple sclerosis, received nearly all her primary and specialty care at Carney Hospital. She moved to Dorchester in 2019 and lives just a few blocks from the hospital in the Harmon Apartments, a community for adults living with physical disabilities. McInerny, who uses a wheelchair, used to be able to get herself to her appointments in a matter of minutes.  
“When I moved here, I felt comfortable with the quality of medical care provided at the Carney, and I said, ‘If I’m in this community and there’s this accessibility, this is where I want to be,’” she said in an interview. “Gov. Healey’s lack of action is really disheartening for me.”

Since the closure, she’s had to find new providers, including a primary care physician, physical therapist, podiatrist, ophthalmologist, and occupational therapist. The closest community health center to Carney, Codman Square, was too busy for her to get in for appointments, reporting nearly a five-month wait time for new primary care patients, according to a Dorchester working group analysis released in April. 
Getting set up with an ophthalmologist took McInerny almost a year. 
She relies on transportation provided by her health insurance to get to her medical appointments, which are now scattered across Beth Israel Deaconess Milton Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Faulkner Hospital, the Nielsen Eye Clinic in Quincy, Braintree Rehabilitation Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and a private office. 
“I’m worried about what’s going to happen. I’m getting further and further from my health care,” McInerny said. “How much energy, time, and money do I want to spend in order to get what I need?” 
McInerny estimates that instead of seeing certain providers every three to four months, she may start going every six or 12. Now, she must schedule her transportation ahead of time.

While facing a different set of challenges than the rural Nashoba Valley region, Dorchester residents, political leaders, activists, and health care providers fought as fiercely to prevent the closure of Carney Hospital, which has served the community since it was founded in 1863. 
Lew Finfer, a community organizer and longtime Dorchester resident, was a former patient at Carney along with his family members. For nearly 40 years he lived two blocks from the hospital. He says passing by it now feels like a “gaping hole.”  
“They had this hearing and people got to testify, but it felt halfhearted, because it was done and it wasn’t going to change anything,” Finfer said of the closure last year. “It makes people feel powerless that something like this just gets closed. It leaves them with a bad taste in their mouth.”  
He had hoped the state would encourage Boston Medical Center to bid on Carney by offering supplemental funding the administration spent to keep the other hospitals open.  
“The state let us down, but people also feel that BMC let Dorchester down too,” he said. 
Longtime community activist and former Carney Hospital CEO Bill Walczak pointed to the state’s seizure of St. Elizabeth’s through eminent domain and questioned why the same couldn’t be done for Carney, even if there were no “qualified” bidders.  
“The fair way to approach it would have been for the Commonwealth to make the same kind of deal that they made with St. Elizabeth’s of taking over responsibility for Carney Hospital,” he said. 
Walczak served as president of the hospital for a brief 14 months from 2010 to 2011. He left after introducing a plan to increase the number of primary care providers, add a maternity unit, and develop a new department of family medicine that was rejected by Steward. 
Carney had around 30,000 annual emergency department visits before it closed. Since then, Boston EMS has seen a 20 percent increase in transport times, according to the  working group analysis. The number of EMS runs from the Carney region to surrounding hospitals also increased following the closure date.  
Boston Medical Center is nearby, but its emergency department is already the busiest in New England and the 11th busiest in the country. The average length of stay in its emergency department was nearly six hours as of March. 
Milton Hospital is just two miles from Carney, but its website has posted a long-term alert: “Due to an increased demand in emergency services, wait times may be longer than usual.” In February, Milton saw a 16 percent increase in emergency department visits compared to the year prior, according to the working group report.  
At Codman Square Health Center, urgent care volume increased 12 percent following the closure of Carney. At DotHouse Health, volume increased 10 percent. 
Dorchester residents already have some of the lowest life expectancy rates in Boston. But as the state moved forward with the sales of the other five Steward hospitals, Kate Walsh, the former Massachusetts HHS secretary, told reporters “the market has spoken” to explain the closures.

Just a few weeks later, shortly before Carney closed its doors for good, the Department of Public Health declared that the hospital was an “essential service necessary for preserving access and health status within the hospital’s service area.” What happens when the market fails to deliver in regions where vast health inequities already exist? Walczak said government intervention is needed in low-income communities that don’t have the payer mix for hospitals to break even and stay open. 
“Somehow the secretary of health and human services was able to get away with saying ‘the market has spoken’ about a hospital in a community with some of the worst health outcomes in the Commonwealth,” Walczak said. “The notion that somehow our health care system should abide by the wishes of the marketplace, which is determined by finances and profits, was obscene.”  
Walczak pushed back on the idea that patients in Dorchester, many of whom don’t own cars, can access hospitals downtown. 
“Most of the time, it’s almost impossible to get downtown in any reasonable time period,” he said. “When you’re coming from Lower Mills in Dorchester, it would take you a half an hour to 45 minutes to get into a downtown hospital.” 
Carney was also a vital source of 50 in-patient psychiatric beds serving patients with mental health and substance use disorder needs. An ongoing shortage of mental health professionals and a lack of available, specialized inpatient beds means 39 percent of behavioral health-related ER visits in Massachusetts lasted more than 12 hours before discharge or admission between January 2024 and May 2024, up from 31 percent in 2020, according to a 2025 Health Policy Commission report. 
Looking ahead  
UMass Memorial is moving ahead with $42 million plans to build a new freestanding emergency facility in Groton – just four miles from Ayer – that is expected to open in 2027. DPH approved the system’s proposal in July. But reports of UMass Memorial’s financial stress have left local leaders like Pontbriand cautiously optimistic.  
At the groundbreaking ceremony for the facility in September, Healey again laid into Steward’s former CEO, Ralph de la Torre, adding that Steward’s “betrayal” would not be “the end of the story.” 
“Today, we recommit to healthcare in this region and across our state,” Healey said to the crowd. “There’s nothing more precious than making sure we have access to care in the most vulnerable moments.” 
In a statement, UMass Memorial spokeswoman Shelly Hazlett said reopening Nashoba Valley’s emergency room was the hospital’s “first choice,” but a deal with Apollo couldn’t be reached in a timely manner. 
“The timeline related to building this satellite emergency facility is comparable to what it would have been to acquire and upgrade the former Nashoba facility,” Hazlett said. “By building a facility from the ground up, we can optimize the design to enhance patient flow, support modern technologies, and improve operational efficiency.”

The facility is expected to offer imaging, lab services, observation beds, and a helipad for transfers in addition to surgical and other emergency services. It will not have inpatient beds.  
A similar stopgap has yet to come to fruition in Dorchester. 
HYM Investment Group, a company led by Thomas O’Brien, former director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, recently signed a contract with Apollo to begin formulating a redevelopment plan for the site, the Dorchester Reporter reported this month.  
HYM will partner with the local advocacy group My City at Peace (MyCAP) to create a plan for the property. The new site will likely include a health care component along with housing and open space, according to O’Brien, although no specific plans have been introduced. Neither he nor MyCAP responded to interview requests. 
“We recognize the important role the Carney Hospital has played in the Dorchester community,” O’Brien said in a statement. “Together, HYM and MyCAP welcome conversations with all who care about the site’s future and look forward to presenting a plan that includes a healthcare component and reflects the needs of Dorchester.” 
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has repeatedly said her administration will block any redevelopment efforts that do not include a health care component. Her office did not answer questions about the new contract for the site, which is currently zoned for multifamily residential use. 
For the local leaders, health care workers, and residents that fought for their hospitals, but were left behind, one question remains: Why? 
“I think part of the community is still looking for that lifeline to come back,” Johnston said. “When is the state going to come swooping in and save us? We don’t have an answer for that.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jane-in-front-of-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 09:16:39.591421

The possibility that President Donald Trump will deploy National Guard troops in San Francisco as part of a nationwide crackdown on crime is intensifying — but recent crime data doesn’t support his claim.
During an interview on a Fox News show earlier this week, Trump said he was eyeing San Francisco next to send the National Guard, adding that he had “unquestioned power” to do so under the Insurrection Act. Trump so far has deployed units in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and other Democratic-leaning cities, although he has not used the Insurrection Act to do it.
State and city leaders in California oppose Trump’s plan: Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters Wednesday he would file a lawsuit “within a nanosecond” if Trump deployed troops, and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said it “will do nothing to … make our city safer.”
In an interview with CalMatters, San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said crime in the city has fallen in “every single category.” She questioned the effectiveness of the National Guard to curb crime since its troops can’t make arrests or investigate crimes. 
Crime data from the San Francisco Police Department show that total crime rates decreased more than 26% so far in 2025, and rates have dropped across the board, except for sex trafficking.
Jenkins said her main concern is that “inhumane” immigration enforcement could serve as a precursor for Trump to send the National Guard. On Wednesday the Trump administration sent federal immigration enforcement agents to a nearby Coast Guard base in the Bay Area, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, where they reportedly are preparing an enforcement sweep.

Jenkins: “There has to be civil unrest in San Francisco, and what we know and have seen is that U.S. Customs, Border Control and ICE are being deployed first in a manner that creates chaos and provokes arrest.”

Whether or not crime is decreasing in a city depends on various factors — such as what type of crime is being measured, in what regions and over what period of time. But San Francisco is experiencing “some of the lowest crime numbers” in at least a decade, said Magnus Lofstrom, the policy director of criminal justice and a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.
Using data from the California Department of Justice, Lofstrom said that during the last quarter of 2024, violent crime in particular decreased by 20% compared to the last quarter of 2023, and property crime lowered by 18%. Shoplifting, however, ticked up during the same period.
Lofstrom also said that while he suspects the presence of uniformed personnel, such as police officers, act as “a deterrence to crime in the short-term,” it is unclear if the effect of National Guard troops in San Francisco “might deteriorate trust in law enforcement and deteriorate community relations.”
Lofstrom acknowledged that whether someone is a personal victim of crime influences their perception of crime rates as well.

Lofstrom: “There is visible evidence of social problems, homelessness and drug use for example. Those evoke concerns about public safety. … Those are factors that contribute to a perception of higher crime or increase in crime even though the data may be pointing towards improvement.”

More on the National Guard: California Attorney General Rob Bonta said Trump is deploying troops to “target those people who didn’t support him” in an interview with CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn Wednesday.

Fight over where Californians can gamble drags on

From CalMatters Digital Democracy reporter Ryan Sabalow:
The battle between state tribes and card rooms spilled over Wednesday outside the California Attorney General’s office in Sacramento. 
Card rooms and the cities dependent on their gambling revenues protested regulations Bonta’s office is proposing. If enacted, card rooms say the rules would kill their ability to offer blackjack and other lucrative games at the gambling halls. 
Tribal casinos have for years sought to prevent card rooms from offering the games, arguing that Californians at the ballot box gave them the exclusive rights to host Las Vegas-style gambling in the state.

San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener is making a bid for Congress.
And, he isn’t waiting for Rep. Nancy Pelosi to retire.
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, the five-term state senator kicked off his campaign Wednesday with a video pledging to push back against Trump’s policies, hold insurance companies accountable and protect the LGBTQ community.
This legislative session Wiener successfully advanced a handful of notable bills into law, including ones to encourage more housing projects near transit stops; ban law enforcement officers from wearing masks; and capping insulin co-pays to $35.
Former U.S. House Speaker Pelosi has represented the city since 1987 and steered the Democratic Party in Congress for much of the past 25 years. Pelosi said she will announce her plans about whether she will retire or seek a 19th term in 2026 until after the statewide special election on Nov. 4.
Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York has also joined the race to potentially unseat Pelosi.

California leaders demand answers,Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/live-fire-shrapnel-lawmakers-trump/,Several California lawmakers are demanding answers from the Trump administration after shrapnel rained down on Interstate 5 over the weekend during a live fire event that was part of the Marines 250th anniversary celebration.,"In summary
Several California lawmakers are demanding answers from the Trump administration after shrapnel rained down on Interstate 5 over the weekend during a live fire event that was part of the Marines 250th anniversary celebration. 


California lawmakers are demanding answers after a live fire demonstration over Camp Pendleton Saturday led to a misfire that rained shrapnel on Interstate 5, striking two California Highway Patrol vehicles.
An artillery shell exploded over the freeway during a celebration of the 250th anniversary of the Marine Corps, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Pieces of shrapnel scattered on the closed roadway and struck a patrol vehicle and motorcycle. 
“I was very disappointed, because I hoped we could celebrate the Marine Corps without undue risk,” Rep. Mike Levin, a Democrat from San Clemente and Carlsbad who represents the district including Camp Pendleton, told CalMatters. “I’m led to believe the decision-making did not put public safety first. That’s why we’re calling for a full investigation.”
On Wednesday Levin sent a letter signed by 26 California Congress members and the state’s two senators to Hegseth, asking who decided to shoot live artillery over the freeway, and how authorities planned for the safety risks.
“While we are relieved no one was injured, we are deeply concerned by the decision-making that led to this incident,” Levin wrote. 
The mishap deepened conflicts between President Donald Trump and California leaders including Gov. Gavin Newsom, with some Republicans chastizing Newsom for closing the freeway during the live fire exercise. Other local leaders were exasperated by an unorthodox military display that they believe was orchestrated for the benefit of Trump administration officials.
“It’s almost absurd that this would be acceptable,” California Sen. Catherine Blakespear, an Encinitas Democrat whose district includes Camp Pendleton, told CalMatters. “And for what? There’s no military benefit. There’s no community benefit. It’s posturing with militaristic bluster at the expense of the safety and well-being of the community.”
The Marine Corp’s 250th birthday party 
On Saturday Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton held a demonstration featuring aircraft, ships, and amphibious assault vehicles to celebrate the milestone anniversary. It involved firing artillery across the coastal freeway in a planned demonstration of 60 rounds, according to the CHP incident report.
That location was unusual, military and public safety officials said. Although live fire training is routine, it usually takes place on designated ranges within the 125,000 acre base in North County San Diego.
“It is highly uncommon for any live-fire or explosive training activity to occur over an active freeway,” CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado said in a statement Sunday.  “As a Marine myself, I have tremendous respect for our military partners, but my foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety of the people of California and the officers who protect them.”
The first round launched at 1:46 p.m. Saturday from M777 Howitzers on a beach west of Interstate 5 toward the east, the incident report stated.  That artillery round failed to clear the roadway and detonated midflight near Interstate 5 southbound, sending shrapnel flying toward protective service details assigned to the vice president. After that, the exercise was halted and no more munitions were fired.
An officer described hearing what sounded like “pebbles” falling on his CHP BMW motorcycle, and other shards struck an empty Ford patrol vehicle. The two officers who had driven the vehicle saw a two inch by half inch piece of shrapnel on the hood, which left a small dent or scratch. Photos in the incident reports show the patrol car struck by shrapnel, and an officer holding the metal shards.  
The CHP called for additional review of the planning, communication and coordination between state and federal partners about the freeway closure and public safety. The Marine Corps is also investigating the incident, the Washington Post reported.
Levin said he hoped the Marine Corps anniversary would bring the country together to honor the force’s 250 year history: “Our Marines deserve to be celebrated without compromising these ideals.”
A risky exercise
The incident snarled traffic for hours on the freeway, which Newsom had ordered closed for the exercise. And it startled residents in San Diego and Orange Counties, who are accustomed to noise from military exercises, but didn’t expect one to take place over a civilian transportation corridor. Some shared photos of surreal highway signs warning of the live fire event.
“Artillery on base is normal,” Levin said. “I hear it all the time from my house. But everything we’ve seen is that firing over the freeway is not how this ordinarily works. Common sense tells us it’s much riskier to fire over the freeway.”
Ian Bennett, a retired Army artillery officer who served in Iraq in 2003, said military leaders plan for every facet of munitions exercises, from gun settings and direction to range conditions and weather.
“You want to make sure that everything is done safely because you don’t want to have a mishap offramp all the good that you’re doing,” Bennett said.
Live fire exercises involve multiple dry fire rehearsals and any that affect civilians or take place in sensitive areas require extra coordination to make sure there are no surprises, he said.
“I’ve never had cause to shoot over a major road during training,” Bennett said. “From my personal perspective, that’s not something I would consider.”
Miscommunications before the mishap
San Diego leaders described miscommunications about the live fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton in the days beforehand, with some elected officials saying they weren’t in the loop.
“If there was coordination, I would expect it would include my office,” Blakespear said. “We weren’t even informed or invited to the event.”
Last Wednesday the Marine Corps issued a statement assuring the public that live fire demonstrations would take place on approved training ranges and comply with established safety protocols. 
But that evening, Levin voiced concern that parts of Interstate 5 could be closed in both directions “to accommodate events tied to anything partisan or political.”
Leaders in Oceanside, the city south of the base, said there was conflicting and changing information about the demonstration until the morning of the event.
“I was in planning for probably a month to a month and a half out, and there were a lot of unknowns,” Oceanside Police Department Assistant Chief John McKean said. “The government doesn’t tell you a whole lot of stuff out front, other than we’re coming out and we want a big party.”
The day before, the word was that the freeway would remain open, Bennett said. He awoke to a phone call at 6:30 a.m. Saturday to learn it would be shut.
Live fire exercise fuels political feuds
In a statement Saturday, Newsom announced the freeway closure, describing the live fire exercise as a show of force meant to intimidate Trump’s opponents, thousands of whom were demonstrating at “No Kings” protests throughout San Diego the same day.
“The President is putting his ego over responsibility with this disregard for public safety,” Newsom wrote. “Firing live rounds over a busy highway isn’t just wrong — it’s dangerous.”
All lanes in an area along the base were scheduled to close for about four hours, McKean said, but they were ultimately shut for just under an hour, between about 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. 
McKean, who served in the Marines, said it’s not typical but not unprecedented to shoot across a roadway. Safety concerns include not only misplaced explosions but also noise distractions, he said.
“It’s more of scaring people with the large percussion that comes from the big boom right in front of you,” he said. “I don’t think they do it that often.”
Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who represents East County San Diego, complained on X that Newsom overruled “the best-trained and most-experienced leaders of our Marine Corps” to shut down the freeway and denounced the closure as “a spiteful publicity stunt… to ruin the occasion.”
After the errant explosion, Issa’s office said the danger was blown out of proportion.
“The media don’t need to amplify these comic exaggerations,” Issa’s spokesperson Jonathan Wilcox wrote in an email to CalMatters. “*This* is what shut the freeway down for several hours? Congressman Issa knows that a real governor — whether Republican Pete Wilson or Democrat Jerry Brown — would never have mislead (sic) the public and exploited a minimal incident for some attempted partisan gain.”
Levin acknowledged that as the minority party Democrats have fewer levers to get answers to questions about the misfire at Camp Pendleton. But he said he’ll use his role on the House Committee on Appropriations to keep up pressure.
“The administration heard safety warnings from the Marine Corps, and completely ignored them,” he said. “That would mean JD Vance and Pete Hegseth cared more about their demonstration than the safety of Marines, the safety of communities. So we need to push for answers and accountability.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102225-Camp-Pendleton-GB-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 09:16:39.591421

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong /Virginia Mercury)After months of review, the Department of Justice announced on Wednesday that it has agreed to suspend its five federal civil rights investigations against the University of Virginia, provided the institution complies, with no financial penalty.
The Justice Department initiated its investigation of the institution in the spring due to its concerns that UVA was violating federal civil rights laws in its admissions, hiring, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students; the school refuted all these allegations. The investigations ultimately led to the resignation of Paul Ryan as president of UVA.

The announcement by the DOJ comes after President Donald Trump signed executive orders focused on reforming universities to align with his administration’s views. Trump and top aides have also claimed that many universities have embraced liberal agendas and are too politicized.
UVA President Jim Ryan resigns amid federal ultimatum

As part of the agreement, UVA agreed to comply with civil rights laws, use the DOJ’s latest guidance when applicable and provide quarterly reports to the government on its compliance efforts.
If the DOJ determines that UVA is making “insufficient progress“ toward compliance, the institution will have 15 days to address the issues before the agreement is terminated and investigations resume.
“This notable agreement with the University of Virginia will protect students and faculty from unlawful discrimination, ensuring that equal opportunity and fairness are restored,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement on Wednesday. Dhillon added that the university has made progress in “combating antisemitism and racial bias,” and warned other schools to “be on alert” that the department would enforce federal civil rights laws. 
UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney wrote in a statement to the institution’s community that he signed the agreement because he believed it to be the best available path forward.
“We intend to continue our thorough review of our practices and policies to ensure that we are complying with all federal laws,” Mahoney said. He added that UVA will also “redouble our commitment to the principles of academic freedom, ideological diversity, free expression, and the unyielding pursuit of ‘truth, wherever it may lead,’ as Thomas Jefferson put it.”
Across the country, the federal agency has challenged other institutions including Harvard University and the University of California on claims that they violated federal civil rights, specifically concerning Title IX compliance, affirmative action, and disability accommodation. Many of the cases have ultimately gone to court, threatening the loss of federal funds.
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, posted on X that UVA’s “surrender” poses “significant constitutional problems and represents a huge expansion of federal power that Republicans … would have never tolerated in the past – we have the right to run our universities.”
Thursday morning, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the agreement a “common sense” and “fair deal.”
As part of the agreement, Mahoney said UVA acknowledges its obligation to follow civil rights laws and that the federal government accepts UVA’s work as demonstrating full compliance, thereby suspending the investigations. The DOJ will close the remaining investigations if UVA maintains compliance with the agreement, which is effective through Dec. 31, 2028.
UVA will still be eligible for future grants, contracts and awards, and none of its grants will be terminated.
The agreement doesn’t equate to an admission of wrongdoing by either the DOJ or the school and UVA “expressly denies liability with respect to the subject matter of the Investigations,” the documents reads.
UVA declines to join Trump administration’s education compact

“Through this process, we will do everything we can to assure our community, our partners in state and federal government, and the public that we are worthy of the trust they place in us and the resources they provide us to advance our education, research, and patient care mission,” Mahoney said.
This agreement comes days after UVA rejected an offer from President Donald Trump‘s administration to sign a compact granting federal funding and privileges in exchange for the school’s support of the administration’s policies.
In a letter about the decision, Mahoney wrote that accepting an offer based on “anything other than merit will undermine the integrity of vital, sometimes lifesaving, research and further erode confidence in American higher education.”

No surprise that the California Wellness Foundation poll found that nearly 80% of voters are worried by the cost of health care. Mental health access is a worry too – and immigration is worsening the problem.  


Californians are overwhelmingly concerned about the costs of health care, and most want better access to mental health services, according to a new poll released Thursday. The survey – commissioned by the California Wellness Foundation – also found that beyond broader economic worries, 57% of respondents statewide are concerned about federal immigration enforcement actions, which are influencing some health-related choices.
“Californians don’t see health as a single dimension, it really is about an overall quality of life,” said Shakari Byerly, managing partner at Evitarus, the research firm that conducted the polling.
Nearly 40% of state residents surveyed said they know someone whose mental health has worsened as a result of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. One in five people indicated that they know someone who is afraid to seek medical care because of immigration activity. 
Byerly said immigration is a more acute concern in the Latino community in Los Angeles, where 60% of people polled know someone experiencing financial hardship that’s tied to immigration actions.
“People have long come to California and remain here for the California dream. Many of these issues strike at the heart of what that dream means and what people still believe is possible, despite pressures and concerns,” Byerly said.
The poll comes ahead of a Nov. 7 forum at UC Riverside where 11 philanthropic organizations, including the wellness foundation, have invited gubernatorial candidates to discuss their health care priorities. So far, former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former State Controller Betty Yee say they plan to attend.
Affordability concerns are common
Nearly 90% of people polled statewide said they’d like to see the next governor prioritize caps on out-of-pocket health costs. 
Though she wasn’t surveyed, 64-year-old San Diego resident Lisa Kaczmarczyk agrees that health care affordability should be a priority for the next administration. 
“Medical has been one of my top expenses every single month for years,” Kaczmarczyk said, even though she’s healthy and has no chronic conditions. 
Self-employed as an educational consultant, Kaczmarczyk purchases her health plan through Covered California, the state’s insurance marketplace. She pays $502 a month in premium costs for an individual gold plan after federal subsidies, plus an average of $576 a month in copays and other costs not covered by her insurance, like dental care. 
The federal government shutdown and its consequences could drive those costs higher. Federal subsidies for marketplace enrollees like Kaczmarczyk may soon change. Enhanced aid introduced during the pandemic is set to expire at the end of the year, and Congress has yet to decide whether to renew that help.
“There are absolutely things that I don’t buy. I prioritize groceries and I prioritize medical bills.” The more she spends on health care, Kaczmarczyk said, the less she can put into her retirement savings or toward things she’d really like, such as new furniture or a vacation.
Health insurance is essential, she says. But like half of Californians, she has delayed seeking some care. Kaczmarczyk said she looks forward to being eligible to enroll in Medicare next year, hoping that will curb her health expenses. 
The next governor’s health priorities
Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders have said that the cost of living is a pressing issue, but legislative reforms to provide relief for Californians may take years to get approved or to take effect.
According to the poll, 72% of Californians said they were worried they wouldn’t be able to afford to live in California long term. It’s a matter that candidates running to be California’s next governor will have to respond to, said Richard Tate, president and CEO of the California Wellness Foundation. 
Among 2,000 Californians surveyed in late August and early September, former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter led the field of potential gubernatorial candidates with support from 20% of respondents. She was followed by Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 16% and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at 13%. The poll’s margin of sampling error was just over 2%. 
In a statement, Tate said, “What voters want from the next governor is clear: affordable housing, health care that doesn’t break the bank, mental health support they can count on, and the ability to care for their loved ones with dignity and peace of mind.”

Citing a CalMatters report, LA County supervisors voted to push their sheriff to restrict sharing and retention of license plate data collected with high-tech surveillance cameras


Drivers in Los Angeles County have a powerful new privacy advocate after the Board of Supervisors pushed to restrict how their license plates are scanned by law enforcement.
The board recently voted to ask the Sheriff’s Department to more stringently regulate its use of the license plate data it collects through high-tech camera systems mounted on patrol cars and above roads. The measure it approved cited reporting from CalMatters that roughly a dozen police and sheriff’s departments throughout Southern California shared such data with federal immigration agencies. 
The September motion requests that the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department, which operates independently from the supervisors, conduct yearly privacy training for deputies with access to license plate cameras and that the data not be used for non-criminal immigration enforcement.
It also requests the department delete plate sightings after 60 days unless they are flagged on criminal lists.
The Sheriff’s Department “welcomes” the motion and plans to review its practices and policies, the department told CalMatters. Per the motion, deputies are to report their license plate reader policy changes to the county by January. It told the Los Angeles Times last month that it operates 931 automated readers.
Depending on the result of that report and whether Sheriff Robert Luna decides to follow the board’s direction, said Supervisor Hilda Solis, who was lead author of the legislation, supervisors may take additional action to further regulate license plate readers in L.A.
The sheriff’s department told CalMatters it has no “current” arrangements for sharing license plate data with federal agencies. A California law enacted in 2015 prohibits the sharing of plate data with out-of-state and federal entities, and requires agencies that use plate readers to have a usage and privacy policy for them. 
Many of the regulations in the L.A. County motion mirror those in a piece of statewide legislation vetoed by the governor earlier this month. That measure, Senate Bill 274, sought to prevent misuse of license plate data by limiting the lists of license plates law enforcement can track and by requiring police to detail a specific case or task force use when they use data from the cameras. 
Solis said she put forward her motion in part because she wanted to publicly support SB 274 before Newsom decided on it. 
CalMatters did not find that the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department shared data with ICE or the Border Patrol, but some Los Angeles area agencies did. The Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment when asked about such sharing.
License plate readers “remain a powerful investigative tool for recovering stolen vehicles, identifying violent crime suspects, and finding missing persons,” supervisors wrote in a September letter urging the governor to sign SB 274 into law. But “its public support depends on confidence that the sensitive location data it generates will never be repurposed for impermissible civil immigration enforcement.”
Board Chairperson Kathryn Barger cast a lone “nay” vote against endorsing SB 274. Barger disapproved of the proposed limit on the time frame over which law enforcement agencies could retain plate data. 
Barger told CalMatters she believes this time limit would have endangered the public and made it harder for police to solve crimes, and that she supports Newsom’s veto. Newsom also opposed a 60-day data retention limit in the state bill, citing similar reasons. 
But that’s the same license plate data retention period followed by the California Highway Patrol, and last year the governor’s office called a 28-day retention period a balance between public safety and privacy.
“When so many of our neighbors live in fear, sharing sensitive data only increases risks.”Eunisses Hernández, Los Angeles City Councilmember
The L.A. County Board of Supervisors has made immigration issues a priority, fast-tracking both the license plate motion and another requesting a report on progress using new state laws to protect schools from ICE raids.
The county motion does not apply to police departments such as LAPD since they are governed by local city councils. The Los Angeles City Council has acquired about $400,000 worth of license plate reader technology for LAPD since June. 
Two Los Angeles city councilmembers, Eunisses Hernández and Hugo Soto-Martínez, consistently vote against the police department’s use of license plate readers, citing concerns over their use in immigration enforcement.
“At a time when so many of our neighbors live in fear, sharing sensitive data only increases risks and erodes confidence,” Hernández wrote in a statement to CalMatters.
Law enforcement agencies using automated license plate readers throughout the state continue to break the law.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit against the El Cajon Police Department earlier this month for violating state law. Reporting by KPBS earlier this month found that this includes federal agencies like ICE. The attorney general’s office has also sent letters to 18 agencies statewide since 2024 for potential violations of state law. 
Following CalMatters reporting in June, subsequent reporting by Palo Alto Online and the San Francisco Standard found that police departments in Atherton, Menlo Park, and San Francisco violated state law. In the wake of that reporting, last month Jennifer Wall, a city council member in the Bay Area city of Woodside, called on the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office to be more transparent about how deputies conclude that searches included in quarterly reports to the council comply with local policy.
When municipalities use automated license plate reader technology, “we need to make sure it’s used appropriately and mechanisms [are] in place to ensure it’s used appropriately,” she told CalMatters. “There has to be accountability for how they’re used.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/052325_LA-Trafiics_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 08:57:01.147262

Sofia Carrasco
Sofia Carrasco is a high school student in San Diego and has spent two years volunteering and leading environmental policy campaigns.


The health and safety of millions of Californians is in jeopardy thanks to a law that bypassed nearly the entire legislative process — bargained and brought to you by Big Oil. 
The law, Senate Bill 237, was introduced and passed in a hurried 72-hour session. This is the legal minimum amount of time a bill must exist before it passes. By avoiding input from key stakeholders, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats are participating in a concerning trend, one which allows industries to lobby and manipulate their way into backdoor deals. 
The California’s Democratic leadership is revoking hard-earned environmental regulations, gifting industries and special interest groups that continue to exacerbate the climate crisis, poison communities and provide false solutions to affordability concerns.
I am only 16, and lead a climate action campaign, Youth v. Oil, run by high schoolers across San Diego County. I reflect numerous organizers who were given no chance to stand up against this legislative attack on our environment. 
To understand SB 237, it’s important to understand how Newsom went from lauding an end to oil drilling in 2024 to proudly advancing crude production. 
A managed fossil fuel transition — which, according to California’s Climate Action Plan, would create 4 million jobs and slash planet-warming gases by 85% — requires the closure of oil refineries as the state becomes more reliant on renewable sources.
The transition to clean energy must be equitable, including plans that consider the local tax base and employment. Yet in response to an earlier law intended to maintain fuel stability amid price spikes, oil companies announced sudden closures of two key refineries without adequate justifications or transition plans.
These refineries cause cancer and asthma in their communities, all while taking advantage of bailouts and tax loopholes. Instead of confronting responsibility for cleanup and retirement costs, these companies leveraged the threat of higher gasoline prices and bent leaders to their agenda. Combined with the estimated $18 million the oil industry spent on lobbying in California over the first half of the year, a zero-sum narrative was developed: Gut your life-saving protections or we’ll drive these refineries out of state. 
Companies like Valero are not being “forced out of business.” They are making record profits, yet fear the unavoidable decline they will experience in upcoming decades. New oil well permits have decreased from 2,664 in 2019 to merely 73 in 2024, according to Consumer Watchdog. In July, California reached the milestone of renewable energy providing two-thirds of the state’s electricity. 
Reversing this kind of remarkable progress is not inevitable — it’s a choice that Newsom and others are now making.
California’s geology produces some of the most climate-damaging oil in the world — most in oil fields are already depleted. But companies like Chevron push rampant disinformation to convince us otherwise. And pushback against industry pollution, such as the campaign to end backyard oil drilling, is more popular than ever.
SB 237 did have opposition. Over 45 organizations signed a letter demanding that state lawmakers side with people over polluters, proposing a plan to stabilize oil supply and hold the industry accountable. Subsequently, the bill reduced its cutbacks to critical environmental review at drilling sites. But this is not enough. 
Backroom politics come at the expense of sickening the predominantly low-income communities closest to these facilities, as top companies reap profits. Under no circumstances should our government pass proposals with flimsy evidence and minimal public input.
With the passage of SB 237, Capitol lawmakers demonstrated what they’re willing to sacrifice. I urge them to follow paths advanced by environmental, economic and racial justice advocates — even the governor himself before this year. 
We must invest in a responsible transition and expose this hypocritical dealmaking.
The climate crisis is my future. For countless others, it’s their present. Big Oil’s political donations are less important than the health of the 34 million Californians exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution.
Do better, Gov. Newsom.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/062322-CARB-RALLY-RL-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C686&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 08:57:01.147262

The meeting was eventually moved to another larger room to accommodate the number of people attended. Those who remained heard of the violent and dangerous conditions within Alabama's prisons. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Ministers and family members described the dangerous conditions that incarcerated people endure in Alabama correctional facilities at a legislative committee hearing Wednesday.
Speaking to a meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee at the Alabama Statehouse that drew hundreds of people, relatives of incarcerated people and those who work with them described assaults, drug overdoses and extortion against inmates and their families, almost five years after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit alleging the conditions in Alabama’s correctional facilities violate inmates’ Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment.
Robert White, a pastor with the ministry Montgomery City of Refuge, told members of the committee on Tuesday that inmates were being “intimidated or extorted” from their bunks, creating what he described as homelessness even though they are in custody at the facility because they have no place to sleep or rest.
“They have to sleep on the floor, in very deplorable positions because someone has taken their bunk from them,” he  said.
White also said that people who are incarcerated continue to live in violent conditions.
“The punishment of taking away their freedom has already been handed,” he said. “We don’t have to subject them to torture. We don’t have to do that to them; we don’t have to subject them to the horrific conditions they are facing. And if I could pick one issue that we have to address, it is sexual assaults. That destroys a man, and it reduces him to that of an animal.”
Speaking at a rally after the meeting, Tim Mathis, whose son Chase died in Elmore County Prison in 2014, said “enough is enough.”
“Too long now, the Alabama Department of Corrections has operated like a shadow, they are unaccountable, untouchable, or so they think,” he said. “They are built on cruelty.”
According to ADOC statistics, 1,600 assaults have been reported in state prisons since the beginning of 2025. ADOC does not categorize the incidents and it is not clear how many involved sexual violence.  .
Limestone Correctional Facility in Limestone County has reported 247 assaults this year, the most of any prison in the state. Julia Tutweiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka was second, with 146 assaults reported this year.
Rev. Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow of The Ordinary People’s Society, an organization that advocates on behalf of people who are incarcerated, said that the violence remains a problem in Alabama’s prisons.
“People are getting beaten to death,” he said. “People are living in bad living conditions. There has been oversight, no citizen involvement, no citizens to help rehabilitate. In any other country, the family is involved.”
The Alabama Legislature in 2024 approved a law creating a “constituent services” department in the DOC to answer questions from the public about the status of people in ADOC custody or the status of the prison facilities.
Stephanie Johnson, constituent services coordinator for the ADOC, said the office fielded almost 2,400 inquiries from July to September of this year. Nearly half of the inquiries dealt with people currently incarcerated in prisons. More than 500 of the inquiries  were wellness checks on a loved one incarcerated in prison. Another 284 calls pertained to safety, while 330 were related to health concerns for people who were incarcerated.
The meeting convened just amid the release of the documentary, “The Alabama Solution,” a documentary that details both the violence and the problems that have plagued the Alabama Department of Corrections.
Among the storylines is that of Corrections officer Roderick Gadson. Gadson was part of a group of corrections officers who beat Steven Davis to death in Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2019. The state, which denies that the officers used excessive force, later settled a lawsuit with Davis’ mother, Sondra Ray, for $250,000.  Gadson was promoted to lieutenant after Davis’ death.
“I, first and foremost, question a system that allows like that to be employed by the Department of Corrections, but I also question a system that allows the same person, who clearly is escalating in his aggression, to go from assault to allegedly beating someone to death,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, during the meeting,
John Hamm, the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections, said that “the culture that you mentioned is there, and that has been something that has been going on for quite some time.”
He said that the Department is soliciting the help of outside services to help address the problem, but that it will take time to solve.
“This is one of those things that makes you happy and sad at the same time, that we have arrested 111 staff,” Hamm said. “That is sad that it would tarnish the bad, but it makes me happy that we are doing that.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7631-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 08:16:39.418744
,California,2025-10-23 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Ballot measure would broaden reform of California’s key environmental law,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-environmental-law-reforms-ceqa/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature overhauled the CEQA environmental laws for housing, but a business group wants that to include other kinds of  ""essential"" projects.","Former Gov. Jerry Brown once referred to overhauling the California Environmental Quality Act as “the Lord’s work” because, he said, it made building much-needed things — housing, transportation improvements, water storage, etc. — too difficult and too expensive.
In 2018, as he neared the end of his second stint as governor, Brown vetoed a bill that would have prevented developers from circumventing CEQA’s laborious provisions by persuading local voters to directly approve projects.
It was one of hundreds of legislative measures CEQA’s defenders — environmental groups primarily — and its critics have proposed in the nearly half-century since then-Gov. Ronald Reagan signed CEQA in 1970.
“Instead of the piecemeal approach taken in this bill, I prefer a more comprehensive CEQA review, which takes into account both the urgent need for more housing and thoughtful environmental analysis,” Brown said in vetoing the bill.
However during his 16 years in the governorship, Brown did virtually nothing to make the fundamental changes he said were needed. CEQA reform was in a political stalemate and, without that “comprehensive review,” governors and legislators have been dealing with the law’s impacts on a case-by-case basis.
Projects that had heavyweight backing — professional sports venues in particular — and the Legislature’s own Capitol construction project could get relief from CEQA’s requirements.
In more recent years, during Gavin Newsom’s governorship, the state’s housing shortage became a frontline political issue. CEQA became a contentious aspect of it as Newsom and legislators enacted numerous bills to remove or reduce procedural barriers to construction. 
Pro-housing groups saw CEQA as a tool development opponents were using to delay or kill projects and that construction unions were misusing to compel developers to employ their members.
Newsom, whose 2018 campaign promises to jump-start housing construction had not borne much fruit, took up the cause of reforming CEQA. A few months ago, in a bill attached to the state budget, he and legislators enacted a major overhaul of the law’s application to housing, particularly high-density, multi-family projects.
“Saying ‘no’ to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who is one of state’s the most pro-housing legislators. “This isn’t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.”
The law’s passage raises another question: Would it be a one-off, or the beginning of a more sweeping change in CEQA that would make other, non-housing projects easier to build?
The California Chamber of Commerce hopes it will be the latter and recently unveiled a ballot measure for the 2026 election that would make it happen. In the main the measure would, if approved by voters, tighten up and streamline the processes for environmental reviews for “essential projects.”
“We’ve fallen too far behind in building the infrastructure that our communities desperately need,” the business organization’s president, Jennifer Barrera, said in a statement. “And the projects that make it through the broken permitting process become so expensive that they raise costs for all of us.”
Barrera cited a list of public and private projects that had been adversely affected by CEQA’s requirements in statute and created by judicial decisions.
“The initiative will create predictability for improvements the state desperately needs — including the building of first responder facilities, wildfire resilience projects, and broadband in underserved communities,” Barrera said. “Californians deserve a law that recognizes prosperity isn’t the enemy of preservation.”
Given the stakes for project proponents and opponents, and CEQA’s almost mythical status, the campaign for and against the measure could be one of the most contentious ballot battles in the state’s history.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101724_PGE-Underground-Cables_MG_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 08:16:39.418744

Two southeast Missouri counties are asking the courts to answer that question after losing one-fifth of their sales tax revenue because of an exemption enacted in 2021. In a bill designed to capture sales tax from online purchases, the legislature expanded an exemption for mines and factories, first enacted in 2007, for utilities and equipment purchases.
Ste. Genevieve County, which has five voter-approved sales taxes, saw its total revenue from the levies decline from $6.1 million in 2022, the last full year without the exemption, to $4.8 million in 2024. Iron County, which has a single half-cent sales tax for general revenue, saw a revenue decline 20%, to $1.1 million from $1.35 million.
In a case filed last week in Cole County, Ste. Genevieve and Iron counties accuse lawmakers of violating the Missouri Constitution by taking away revenue required for bond payments, reducing the funds available for state-mandated functions and adding excessive new tax burdens on Missourians without a statewide vote.
“If you look at the 115 counties in Missouri, there’s probably several other counties in a similar boat here,” attorney Stephen Jeffrey, who is representing the counties, said in an interview with The Independent.
Ste. Genevieve County is heavily dependent on mining but residents are not open to every new venture, as this 2022 sign opposing efforts by NexGen Mining Inc. to mine silica in the county shows. (Niara Savage/Missouri Independent).
There are no large retailers in Ste. Genevieve County, Presiding Commissioner Randy Ruzicka said. The county of about 18,500 people has sand and gravel mining. Not only did the exemption mean the county lost sales tax on utilities used in the operations, the companies no  longer pay sales tax on equipment and maintenance supplies purchased locally.
Ste. Genevieve County is paying for a water park and community center financed by a $10 million bond issue in 2018. The revenue loss from the exemption means the tax dedicated to bond payments is $300,000 to $400,000 short of the funds needed to meet the debt service, Ruzicka said.
So far, he said, the payments have been made by tapping reserves. That can’t continue, he said.
“If every year you have to pull money out of what you have put aside, there comes that point where you don’t have any more money,” Ruzicka said.
It will likely be many months before the lawsuit comes to a resolution, so lawmakers will meet next year with the questions it raises pending. 
“This would have an implication if the legislature tries to get rid of the local tax on food,” said Elias Tsapelas, director of state budget and fiscal policy for the Show-Me Institute, a conservative think tank. “Just more broadly, in the discussion of what to do with Missouri’s tax policy, I think it’s pretty big.”
 The ‘Wayfair fix’

In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could require residents to pay sales tax on purchases shipped to them from retailers outside the state. The decision reversed earlier precedents that determined a retailer had to have a physical presence within a state before it had to collect tax on retail sales.
The decision required each state to add language to its sales tax law to capture the revenue. Missouri was the last state to do so when the 2021 bill passed. Under the bill, Missourians who make online or catalog purchases must pay the state tax of 4.225%, while local governments were required to ask voters if they wanted to extend the sales tax to those goods.
The fiscal note, the legislature’s official estimate of each bill’s financial impact, pegged the additional state revenue from online sales at $111 million to $170 million annually, with local revenue expected to grow by $41 million to $62 million if enacted in every taxing jurisdiction.
As part of the deal to capture the new revenue, business lobbyists convinced lawmakers that they also had to extend every exemption from state sales tax to local sales taxes to simplify collections.
“One of the key parts of the United States Supreme Court decision in the Wayfair case was the fact that they have made it simple for businesses to comply,” said Ray McCarty, executive director of Associated Industries of Missouri.
That means local governments cannot tax anything that is not taxed at the state level, McCarty said.
The sales tax on food is an example. While the state does not impose the 3% general revenue sales tax on grocery purchases, it does collect a 1.225% tax — earmarked money for schools, conservation, state parks and soil conservation.
The 2021 bill did not have to include an exemption for food sales, McCarty said, because the state taxes it even if it is not the full tax imposed on other goods.
“You can imagine the complexity if you have different sales tax bases for state and local governments,” McCarty said. “If you’re not located in the state of Missouri, then you could have issues with that.”
Along with the exemption for purchases by manufacturers and mining companies, the bill enacting the online tax for Missouri extended state exemptions for purchases by broadcasters, defense contractors and commercial laundries to local sales taxes.
The Wayfair decision did not require any state to change how it levied sales tax or to make exemptions uniform, Jeffrey said. 
“I have read the Wayfair decision on more than one occasion, and nowhere in the language, in that opinion, does it say a state must do this,” he said. “There is never this requirement that you have to do it this way.”
 The lawsuit

The case filed by Ste. Genevieve and Iron counties alleges three violations of the Hancock Amendment, the tax limitation provisions added to the Missouri Constitution in 1980.
Those provisions are the guarantee that local governments will be able to impose the taxes necessary to pay voter-approved bond debt, that the state cannot reduce its support for any state-financed service or activity and that the state enacted revenue increases that exceed the limits.
The lawsuit asks the courts to order lawmakers to make appropriations to replace the lost revenue and declare the legislation void, restoring the taxes.
The Hancock Amendment bars the legislature from imposing any new duties on local governments without an appropriation to pay the costs. But that hasn’t stopped lawmakers from doing so, said Jim Scaggs, presiding commissioner of Iron County.
The lawsuit lists some of those new duties without state support as “increasing compensation and training for officials, mandating law enforcement disciplinary proceedings, mandating assessment maintenance, and mandating administration of a new senior citizens property tax program.”
Any individual item “has not been that costly, but when we add them all together, the cost is pretty substantial,” Scaggs said.
At the same time that lawmakers are adding costs and taking away revenue, Scaggs and Ruzicka said, their small counties are losing businesses.
“My stores have closed down because they can’t compete with the big box stores,” Scaggs said. “So we just keep losing and losing.”
Ste. Genevieve, which once had three auto dealerships, lost its final one last year, Ruzicka said.
And neither has a marijuana dispensary, a substantial source of new revenue in many other locations, they said. Marijuana dispensaries pay regular sales taxes and a special tax just for pot sales.
Marijuana revenue, plus successful use tax elections, has spared some counties the pain as mining and manufacturing revenue is removed, Ruzicka said.
“A lot of other counties have, like our neighbors to the south Perryville, tons of retail,” he said. “They also have dispensaries, and there’s a 3% tax on dispensary stuff, so it has sort of papered over the problem for them.”
Customers keep the fuel pumps flowing at a Columbia convenience store near Interstate 70 on the day a gas tax hike took effect Oct. 1, 2021 (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The lawsuit’s accusation that lawmakers exceeded their authority for increased taxes and fees is based on two bills, the Wayfair fix and an increase to the state gas tax, also passed in 2021.
The constitutional limit for new taxes and fees in fiscal 2022 was $111.8 million, according to the 2023 annual Hancock Amendment review from the state auditor. The allowable new revenue for fiscal 2024, according to a review issued earlier this year, was $144 million.
The Wayfair revenue was about equal to the allowable revenue, the lawsuit states, and the gas tax — 12.5 cents per gallon, phased in over five years — pushed the total of new taxes above the limit.
Local governments will be watching the lawsuit, said Steve Hobbs, executive director of the Missouri Association of Counties, because the Wayfair bill represents a shift in how lawmakers interact with local governments. 
In the past, large sales tax exemptions excluded local governments or gave them an option on whether to participate, such as on back-to-school tax holidays.
“Now we’re seeing a trend at the state level where they’re saying, ‘No, voluntarily is not enough, we’re going to tell you that you’re going to roll this revenue stream back, even though the local citizens have voted on it,’” he said. “That’s the biggest discussion we’re having in the General Assembly and in the state right now.”
The lawsuit was a last resort, Scaggs said.
If Iron County voters approved a use tax, it would about make up the shortfall, he said. But that represents a shift of the tax burden from businesses to individuals that he opposes, he said.
“This is not something I want to be involved in,” Scaggs said. “This is not good government, in my mind. But at the same time, we can’t continue to go down this road where these small, third class counties will not have enough revenue to support themselves.”
 Food sales and property taxes

The biggest sales tax exemption on the books at the state level that is not allowed at the local level is for food sales in grocery stores. Enacted in 1999 when state revenues were exceeding the Hancock Amendment allowance, it removed the 3% general revenue portion of the tax.
The state continues to charge 1.225%, with 1% dedicated to public schools and the remainder for conservation, state parks and soil conservation. Local taxes are also charged at the grocery check-out.
Expanding the exemption would reduce funding available for schools by about $200 million annually. The loss to local governments, according to a fiscal note for a bill filed in this year’s session, would be about $850 million.
A loss like that would be devastating to local governments, Hobbs said. 
“I am starting to wonder if the state believes that we actually need local services, like firefighters, ambulance districts, libraries, levy districts and special road districts,” Hobbs said.
Every attempt to expand the general revenue exemption to local taxes has been met with stiff resistance. It helps that there is unity among local governments large and small to lobby to protect that revenue, Ruzicka said.
“That helps us, because they generally have the ear of the powers that be,” he said. “The small counties, it is kind of like, they nod and say whatever, and then it’s like, ‘just go away.’”
Legislative committees in both chambers are studying property taxes. The goal is to write legislation that can be enacted next year to make tax bills more predictable.
There are some conservatives who have pushed to eliminate personal property taxes — the tax on vehicles and other high-value goods that are not real estate. That would eliminate about 20% of the statewide property tax base.
Tax rates on other property would have to rise or local governments would have to do without the revenue if that is included in the final bill.
“It’s going to get to the point where these counties are not going to be able to pave their roads or provide the services for their people,” Ruzicka said.
The lawsuit over legislative powers to change taxes in ways that reduce revenue is flawed, McCarty said, because the taxes were created by the General Assembly and can be changed by it.
“I do believe that the state has the ability to control what is included in the sales tax base, and the local ability to tax flows from the state,” McCarty said.
The lawsuit, if it survives a motion for dismissal, could set a firm boundary for the legislature and how far its powers extend over local revenue.

If the federal government shutdown extends beyond October 31, federal funding would be insufficient to cover the cost of Nevada’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for November or beyond, said the Office of the Governor Wednesday. 
Every month SNAP provides food assistance to nearly 500,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the total population. In total, those benefits amount to about $90 million a month in distributions, more than Nevada can feasibly cover with other emergency state funds. 
“The State does not have this amount of funding available in the Emergency Account, Disaster Relief Account, or the Interim Finance Committee Contingency Unrestricted General Fund,” the governor’s office said. 
The Nevada Division of Social Services, which administers SNAP, was first informed about the potential lapse in funding on Oct. 10 when the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent a letter to Nevada and other states warning that funds for the program would run out by the end of the month if lawmakers don’t approve a new spending bill. 
The agency said they will continue to accept applications for SNAP benefits from Nevada residents, but can’t guarantee they will be able to issue new or ongoing benefits past this month if the shutdown continues. The agency said additional food resources can be found at Nevada 211 for those impacted by the shutdown.
The governor’s office said it’s working with the Nevada Department of Human Services and the Nevada Department of Agriculture “secure supplemental resources for SNAP beneficiaries in the event the shutdown extends beyond October 31.”
If the state were to use the general fund, the rainy day fund, or other unspent federal funding to cover the cost of SNAP during the shutdown it could risk compliance with federal regulations, according to the governor’s office. 
While the state could potentially implement an emergency program to ensure compliance with federal regulations, it would likely take about three to six months to set up, said the governor’s office. 
WIC
The Nevada Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) is in a better position and will be funded through December 23, regardless of the shutdown.
More than 55,000 Nevadans benefit from WIC, which provides federal food assistance to new parents and young children. Under the program, participants can use benefits to buy infant formula, baby food, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and other staples while also providing breastfeeding and nutrition support.
The Trump administration distributed $300 million in unspent tariff funds earlier this month to keep the program afloat during the shutdown. Nevada WIC received about $3.1 million in tariff funds on Oct. 15, according to the Nevada Division of Social Services. Those federal funds are projected to keep the program running through November, despite the shutdown.
Should the money run out and the shutdown continue, the Nevada Interim Finance Committee approved $7.3 million in emergency funds on Oct.14 to continue weekly distribution of the food benefits to Nevadans who rely on the program. That funding is expected to ensure the program continues through at least Dec. 23.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wicphoto-1024x6831760986469-1.jpg,,,2025-10-23 08:16:39.418744
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-23 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials ask: Could tax cuts and credits counter federal aid loss?,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/23/ct-tax-cuts-federal-aid/,"There are no legal obstacles blocking CT government from cutting taxes, but the political challenges remain plentiful.","Connecticut officials’ efforts to invest state money in shrinking federal human service programs are encountering more legal and technical challenges than anticipated, so the focus has begun shifting to another type of aid: state tax cuts.
While there are no legal obstacles blocking the state government from putting more dollars back in household budgets, the political challenges remain plentiful.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, this week called for Connecticut to again consider creating a new child tax credit within the state income tax system. The most popular proposal in recent years would send as much as $1,800 annually into low- and middle-income households.
But paying for it would cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when Connecticut legislators still may have some options to help working households afford health care, food and other necessities.
So, Looney again is challenging his fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority and Gov. Ned Lamont to consider boosting state taxes on Connecticut’s wealthiest households, which recently became the recipients of enormous federal income tax relief.
House Republicans also want to slash taxes dramatically. Their plan to bolster middle-class income tax refunds by as much as $700 per year would be one of the largest state tax cuts in Connecticut history.
But to do so, Republicans would have to scale back, at least somewhat, very aggressive efforts Connecticut has made since 2017 to pay down a huge pension debt that dates to the late 1930s.
“We are under enormous pressure,” Looney said, from both from an Oct. 1 federal government shutdown that immediately imperils nutrition and energy assistance programs and ongoing federal cutbacks that threaten these programs and key health care initiatives going forward. “The state is likely going to have to be more dependent on its resources.”
The fiscal policy bill that Congress and President Donald Trump approved in early July would strip almost $1 trillion from Medicaid, other human services, green energy and student loan programs over the next decade.
One of the most painful cuts, Looney noted, involves changes to federal tax credits starting Jan. 1 that will cause premiums to spike for millions of Americans who buy health coverage on Affordable Care Act exchanges.
About 150,000 Connecticut residents purchase coverage through Access Health CT, and about 90% of those benefit from a federal subsidy. Legislators here fear many residents will see their monthly premiums grow by hundreds of dollars.
But the budget cuts would offset a portion of federal tax cuts worth more than $4.3 trillion through 2034, a relief plan tilted heavily in favor of wealthy households.
Taxing the rich to fund middle class relief? Easier said than done
Given that, and Connecticut’s need for resources, Looney said he would reintroduce two state tax hike proposals aimed at the state’s wealthiest residents.
The first would boost state income tax rates on the capital gains earnings of Connecticut’s richest households. The Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee endorsed this plan last year, which would have added a 1.75% surcharge on the capital gains earnings of individuals whose overall income exceeds $1 million and on couples topping $2 million. But the proposal was excluded from the final budget compromise between Lamont and the General Assembly.
Looney also said he would introduce what’s commonly called a “mansion tax,” a statewide levy on high-value residential property. Last year he proposed a tax of two mills on properties assessed between $3 million and $5 million and three mills on those assessed at more than $5 million. (One mill generates $1 of tax revenue for every $1,000 of assessed value.) The measure died in the Finance Committee.
These hikes, the New Haven lawmaker said, would capture only a portion of the federal tax cuts wealthy Connecticut households are receiving.
And these proposals would draw strong support from progressive groups that argue Connecticut’s state and municipal tax system already heavily favors the wealthy.
The state’s last tax fairness study, released in 2024, found the lowest-earning 10% of Connecticut households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and more than twice the statewide average.
Looney released 2023 state income tax data this week from the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis that showed Connecticut’s wealthiest towns reported an average, adjusted gross income per filer 15 times or more than of those in the state’s poorest cities.
“The impact to Connecticut families from the federal cuts will devastate already struggling families into a deeper crisis if Connecticut leaders don’t take bold decisive action now,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a grassroots coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic groups. “In order to have sustainable revenue, we must pass progressive revenue policies that ask the ultra-rich and big corporations to pay their fair share, reversing the massive transfer of wealth to the top 1%.”
But the proposed state tax hikes almost certainly would spark fierce opposition, including from some of Looney’s fellow Democrats.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has blocked repeated efforts to boost taxes on Connecticut’s wealthiest, arguing they would flee the state.
Carol Platt Liebau, director of the Hartford-based Yankee Institute for Public Policy, called any state tax hike proposal a “non-starter” and agrees that it only would prompt rich households to relocate.
“We don’t want to drive people to Florida or to move to [other] tax-friendly states,” she said. “We want all of the people of Connecticut to be able to stay here and flourish here.”
But Looney said he’s hopeful the pain caused by federal budget cuts will challenge Lamont, other moderate Democrats, and Republicans to reconsider their longstanding opposition to financing middle-class tax relief with increases on the rich.
“Our unmet needs are growing all the time,” he said. “We need to just take a fresh look at our situation and be grateful we are in a situation better than many other states.”
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, a progressive Democrat who is challenging Lamont for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said the legislature’s Democratic majority “is already there on this issue. We’ve been there on the issue of tax fairness before it was even acute.”
The fate of any tax redistribution plan, he added, hinges on Lamont. “Does the governor actually care about working families?” he said.
Lamont’s office reminded reporters this week that the governor signed the largest state tax cut in history into law in 2023, sending about $300 back to most middle class families while boosting the state income tax credit for the working poor to one of the highest of any state.
House GOP tax cut would slow, not stop, paying off pension debt
Even if Connecticut doesn’t ask more from its wealthiest households, there are other options to provide relief. But they also face political obstacles.
House Republicans on Tuesday proposed boosting a state income tax credit that offsets a portion of middle-class filers’ property tax bills from $300 to $1,000 at a cost to the state of about $500 million per year.
At first glance, Connecticut could cover that bill without raising taxes.
State government has averaged annual surpluses topping $1.8 billion since 2017, part of an aggressive effort to build reserves and whittle down tens of billions of dollars in pension debt accumulated by 1939 and 2010.
Spending $500 million on tax relief likely still would leave significant funds to reduce pension debt, which still topped $35 billion entering last fiscal year, according to Lamont’s budget office.
But some officials remain cautious about any interruption in Connecticut’s ongoing war against its legacy pension debt.
Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said this week that the governor “is supportive of policies or ideas that make life more affordable and reduce burdens on middle-class and working families,” but he didn’t weigh in directly on the House Republican plan.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said his caucus also hasn’t taken a position on the tax cut offered by House Republicans but said cutting taxes is “a much, much better option” than increasing state spending to cover shortfalls in federal human services programs.
Harding added, though, that Senate Republicans remain strong supporters of Connecticut’s efforts to pay down its huge pension debt, and this effort shouldn’t be reduced without careful consideration.
“Our focus,” he said, “should be on making our government operate more efficiently.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0604_SR_SessionLastDay_240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 08:16:39.418744

Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, listens to a debate over his resolution calling the World Health Organization ""corrupt"" in the Alabama House of Representatives on April 11, 2024 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama representative has refiled a bill that would extend the state’s prohibition on discussions of gender identity from grades K-5 to all public school grades.  
HB 23, sponsored by Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, would prohibit classroom instruction or discussion about gender identity and sexual orientation and stop teachers from hanging up rainbow flags in their classrooms. The bill would also prevent teachers from calling students by pronouns other than the ones aligned with biological sex at birth. 
Butler said in an interview Wednesday the bill is meant to help public schools focus on educating students and claimed that the recent enrollment decline partially comes from parents who are unsatisfied with LGBTQ content in schools. Alabama public officials have not said that was a reason for the drop in the K-12 population. 
“And as you’re seeing with the decreased enrollment, and a lot of it’s the CHOOSE Act and the virtual school or home schooling, but there absolutely is a dissatisfaction with what we’re doing, and I see this as helping public education get them back to their actual core charge,” he said.
Enrollment numbers for public schools have declined for the 2025-26 school year by over 5,800 students (0.8% year-over-year). Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said in an interview Monday the reasons for the decline come from students who have received CHOOSE Act funds and students who have enrolled but have not come to school.
“One of the things we’re investigating now is that a lot of these students [who were unaccounted for] could actually be homeschooling, but just did not go through the formal withdrawal process at the school. And that’s, that’s kind of what I think now might be the leading indicator,” he said.
Butler introduced a similar version of the bill in the 2025 legislative session last spring, but the bill failed to be passed by the Senate. This is his first time prefiling the bill.
“It’s just the teachers being paid to teach a curriculum, and they absolutely they wear a lot of hats to deal with a lot of things, and mental health is one just the reality they’re having to deal with, because I spent 10 years on the school board, and it’s a lot different what you’re dealing with today than what we were just two years ago. But just adding to the confusion is not helpful.”
During a Senate Education Policy meeting, multiple people opposed the bill saying that it would be a waste of time and that “Legislature does not get to legislate morality.” Only one person spoke in support of the bill at the meeting.
The Alabama Legislature in the last five years has passed several laws targeting LGBTQ+ people, including the original “Don’t Say Gay” law passed in 2021 and a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth the following year. 
Butler said while LGBTQ discussions in Alabama classrooms aren’t a major issue, there are a small group of schools that do discuss gender identity and sexual orientation. He did not name any schools discussing this topic.
“It is a minority. And that’s what people will try to tell me it’s not happening, and I go, ‘Okay, why would you be offended by such to say this, let’s just focus on the reading, writing and the arithmetic and leave that alone.’ But it absolutely is happening,” he said.
Former Rep. Patricia Todd, D-Birmingham, who was the first openly gay member of the Alabama House of Representatives, said Wednesday that LGBTQ issues should be discussed in schools because the community could be intertwined in students’ daily life.
“All parents should be talking to their kids about LGBTQ issues, because probably sometime in their lifetime, they’re going to encounter that, and they might have friends who have same-sex parents,” she said.
While schools will not be allowed to instruct classes on gender identity and sexual orientation, students can still discuss it with faculty and staff.
“The student will still be able to talk to the teacher, the counselor, the principal, whoever, but it would keep the corporate push off of it,” Butler said.
Age appropriate conversations surrounding gender identity and sexual orientation are also allowed. Butler said this is because the State Department of Education requested it.
“That’s the only thing [the State Department of Education] requested. They say we’re not opposing the bill. We would just request that you put this in. And I said absolutely, because, you know, our goal is to work with them,” Butler said.

Trump’s policies, according to NV Energy’s July 28 waiver request, “may have created significant challenges for solar and wind developers, especially for projects on land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.”
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, however, this week ruled that NV Energy “has not demonstrated that the requested waiver is limited in scope,” a standard that FERC requires to grant a deviation from its rules. 
In NV Energy’s filing, two trade groups, Solar Energy Industries Association and the Interwest Energy Alliance, said NV Energy’s requested waiver would “encourage now-uncertain projects to withdraw from the queue or terminate their projects quickly, without penalty and with rapid return of their commercial deposits.” 
SEIA declined to comment Wednesday and referred the Current to its comments filed in the case. IEA did not respond to requests for comment. 
The waiver was necessary, the utility and the trade groups asserted, because of Trump policies such as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, an executive order, and a Department of Interior memo issued in the wake of the bill’s passage. 
The OBBB eliminates or phases out a number of clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and is expected to increase energy prices and reduce investment in renewables.
As a result of Trump’s policy, Nevada’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to “shrink by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.5 billion in 2035. Between 2025 and 2034 – the Reconciliation budget window – cumulative GDP would shrink by $8 billion in Nevada,” according to a state-by-state analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. 
The July 15 DOI memo requires that both the deputy secretary and secretary of the interior personally review “every decision, action, consultation, and other undertaking” related to solar and wind development on federal land under BLM management, which is most of the state, NV Energy wrote. 
Trump’s phasing out and elimination of clean energy credits will not affect NV Energy’s anticipated load for Greenlink, a $4.2 billion transmission line project regulated by FERC, according to NV Energy spokeswoman Meghin Delaney.
“Greenlink does provide access to renewable energy corridors in Nevada that are not accessible without Greenlink transmission lines, but the primary goal is to improve service for our customers and support growth across our service area,” Delaney said in August.
The utility had hoped that clearing the decks of unworkable projects could pave the path for those that remain viable. 
NV Energy, “in line with the decision, will continue to follow the established process and work with customers in the interconnection queue in accordance with our tariff,” Delaney said Wednesday via email.

Under the agreement reached Friday between the teachers union and the administration, the Education Department will process loan forgiveness for those eligible in certain repayment plans that offer lower monthly payments based on a borrower’s earnings. The government had stopped providing forgiveness under those plans based on its interpretation of a different court decision.
The agreement will also protect borrowers from being hit with high tax bills on debt due to be forgiven this year.
“We took on the Trump administration when it refused to follow the law and denied borrowers the relief they were owed,” AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. “Our agreement means that those borrowers stuck in limbo can either get immediate relief or finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.”
The Education Department said the Trump administration is reviewing forgiveness programs to identify ones that were not affected by court rulings that blocked much of the Biden administration’s efforts to cancel student debt.
“The Administration looks forward to continuing its work to simplify the student loan repayment process through implementation of the President’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the department said in a statement.
Several forgiveness programs are included
According to the deal, the Trump administration must cancel student debt for eligible borrowers enrolled in the following plans: income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, income-contingent repayment plans, Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) plans.
If borrowers have made payments beyond what was needed for forgiveness, those payments will be reimbursed. The Education Department must also continue to process IDR and PSLF “buyback” applications. Balances forgiven before Dec. 31 will not be treated as taxable income, as they will in 2026 due to a recent change in tax law.
The administration must also file progress reports every six months with the court to show the pace of application processing and loan forgiveness, according to the AFT.
How many borrowers are waiting for forgiveness?
An estimated 2.5 million borrowers in IDR plans will be affected by the agreement, and another 70,000 are waiting for forgiveness through the PSLF program.
Even with the agreement in place, mass layoffs at the Education Department could factor into processing times for forgiveness, said Megan Walter, senior policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.
If borrowers continue to make payments while their application is pending forgiveness, that will be refunded to them if they are successful, Walter said. “But keep really good records,” she said.
What are the PSLF and buyback forgiveness programs?
Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which has been in place since 2007, forgives federal student loans for borrowers who have worked at non-profit organizations or in public service after 120 payments, or 10 years. The Biden administration also created an option for borrowers to “buy back” months of payments they missed during forbearance or deferment in 2023, to allow more people to qualify for that forgiveness.

El otoño pasado, los votantes de Connecticut aprobaron una enmienda constitucional que permitió el voto en ausencia universal (también conocido como “sin excusa”), allanando el camino para que la legislatura aprobara una ley que permitiera a todos los votantes emitir su voto en ausencia. Sin embargo, la legislatura no ha aprobado dicha ley, por lo que el voto en ausencia solo está disponible para los votantes que cumplen con los requisitos.
¿Qué pasa si no estoy registrado para votar?
Connecticut ofrece registro de votantes el mismo día durante el período de votación anticipada y el día de las elecciones.
Durante la votación anticipada, puede registrarse en su centro de votación. El día de las elecciones, puede registrarse en el sitio de registro de su ciudad, que probablemente se encuentre en el sitio web de su municipio.
¿Cuáles son algunas de las contiendas electorales más importantes?
Las dos ciudades más grandes con elecciones a la alcaldía en noviembre son New Haven y Stamford. En ambas ciudades, los alcaldes Demócratas en ejercicio se postulan para la reelección contra sus rivales Republicanos.
El alcalde de New Haven, Justin Elicker, se postula para un cuarto mandato de dos años. Su oponente Republicano es Steve Orosco, exluchador de MMA y fundador de SMASH MMA, una organización de eventos de artes marciales mixtas.
La alcaldesa de Stamford, Caroline Simmons, se postula para un segundo mandato de cuatro años. Su oponente Republicana es Nicola Tarzia, es la fundadora de una empresa de servicios de plomería, calefacción y construcción y exmiembro de la Junta de Educación de Stamford.
Norwalk y Hamden también tienen elecciones para la alcaldía, pero en esos municipios los candidatos se postulan para escaños vacantes.
En Norwalk, la candidata Demócrata es la presidenta del Consejo Municipal, Barbara Smyth, una maestra jubilada que derrotó a su compañera concejal Darlene Young en las primarias. Se enfrentará al candidato Republicano Vinny Scicchitano, dueño de un taller mecánico y miembro del Club Saint Ann de Norwalk.
El candidato Demócrata de Hamden es Adam Sendroff, expresidente de la junta escolar y funcionario municipal de larga trayectoria, quien ganó una primaria con cinco candidatos. Su oponente Republicano es Jonathan Katz, asistente legal con títulos en economía y economía política internacional de la Universidad de Fordham.

If Burlington truly wishes to honor Chief Greylock, it must do so in collaboration with those who carry his heritage. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Richard Witting: Burlington must engage with actual Abenaki descendants about Greylock statue.","This commentary is by Richard Witting, of Burlington. He is a Vermont historian whose research focuses on Abenaki history and the related topics of eugenics, disability and institutionalization in 20th-century Vermont. 


As a life-long Burlington “townie” I was saddened to see the Chief Greylock statue in Battery Park removed, but as a historian who does Native advocacy, I was far more disturbed to learn what was to replace it.
As a child, I can remember standing below the towering figure of Chief Greylock in Burlington’s Battery Park, gazing up in awe. Installed in 1984, the statue was carved by Hungarian-American artist Wolf Toth, who traveled to all 50 states building monuments in honor of Native people.
Though not originally intended to depict Greylock it came to represent him, with a plaque describing his life and leadership among the Abenaki. 

READ MORE

Chief Greylock — Abenaki name Wawanolewat — was an 18th-century Abenaki war leader closely tied to the Native village of Odanak, in Quebec, that was the spiritual, political, and military center of Abenaki resistance to English expansion. His name and legacy are still honored there. The Wawanolet and Nolett families of Odanak trace their ancestry to Greylock, including Daniel Nolett, general manager of the Abenaki Council of Odanak—and a friend—who is part of that lineage.
To his credit, Toth’s sculptures were created in partnership with local Native communities. However in Vermont, he was misled—consulting with the self-styled “St. Francis/Sokoki Band,” a group who in 1975 began falsely claiming descent from the Abenaki people who once lived there.
Investigations by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Vermont Attorney General, journalists, and independent  researchers have all confirmed these claims are untrue. The group’s members are overwhelmingly of French-Canadian descent—not Native. Not Abenaki.
At the statue’s dedication, members of this group performed an invented “blessing ceremony,” dancing around the statue. Over time, they renamed themselves the “Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi,” styling themselves after the real Abenaki community that once lived in the Swanton–Highgate region before relocating north to Odanak in the late 1700s. This modern group’s only connection to these historical people is their proximity to the land the Abenaki once occupied—and a desire to claim that heritage.
Hearing of the statue’s imminent removal, I was dismayed to learn that Burlington planned to replace it with a new sculpture by an “Indigenous” artist affiliated with this so-called “Missisquoi”  Reviewing City Council minutes, I found the proposal and an image of the replacement. 
Bluntly, the design resembles a cheap knock-off of the original: a generic caricature of an “Indian” face, neither Abenaki in style nor substance, with “Missisquoi Abenaki” scrawled below — topped with a logo apparently appropriated from the Quebec Indigenous Police Force.
This decision stems from a well-meaning but misinformed 2022 City Council resolution recognizing this modern group as Burlington’s “first people”. Like the City, many other Vermont institutions now find themselves in similar positions, having based policies on bad information.
That was 2022. But the record is now clear and I would expect the city to be aware of the extensive reporting by VTDigger, APTN, and Vermont Public and the finding of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and attorney general regarding this topic. 
Burlington must recognize that it got this wrong, take responsibility and correct course. Partnership with false groups harms all of us. It erases the stories of real Abenaki descendants — whose communities have remained centered at Odanak and Wôlinak since their displacement from Vermont — and it diverts resources and relationships away from actual Indigenous nations from the legitimate Indigenous nations of this region.
As a resident of this city, I strongly protest any move by Burlington to further legitimize fictionalized histories and I urge the city to consult with the Odanak and Wôlinak First Nations — the documented descendants of Vermont’s original Abenaki inhabitants — before undertaking any public project that purports to represent Abenaki culture.
 Burlington now has an opportunity to do what it failed to do forty years ago: engage with the living descendants of Chief Greylock and with living First Nations of our region. If Burlington truly wishes to honor Chief Greylock, it must do so in collaboration with those who carry his heritage. 
The goal should not be to replace one wooden statue with another, but to do better with our representation and partnerships with Vermont’s First People — not to repeat past mistakes. Burlington’s decision now will shape how future generations understand both Chief Greylock and the Indigenous history of this city — and our relationship to it.
After more than four decades of honoring his name, we owe it to Greylock’s descendants — and to the truth — to get the story right. Good relations with the communities who still honor him are possible, but only if the city chooses honesty and accountability over convenience and myth.

(Photo courtesy of Washington governor's office)Gov. Bob Ferguson signed an executive order Wednesday to strengthen how the state consults and works with Native American tribes in Washington.
It calls for drafting new policies for tribal consultation and requires expanded training for state workers on sovereignty and other issues related to understanding the unique nature of the ties between the state and tribal governments.
Tribal leaders applauded the move, but also flagged ongoing tensions in the relationship.
In addition, the Governor’s Office of Indian Affairs will get a permanent seat in Ferguson’s executive cabinet and expanded authority and responsibility to carry out the order’s directives.
“I’ve heard from Tribal leaders about how we can improve our partnership with Tribal governments,” Ferguson said in a statement. “I’m putting that feedback into action and laying out my vision for fostering meaningful government-to-government relationships.”
Ferguson signed the six-page order to kick off Wednesday’s session of the 2025 Centennial Accords meeting hosted by the Cowlitz Indian Tribe in southwest Washington. This was Ferguson’s first time attending as governor.
The Centennial Accord, a 1989 agreement signed by then Washington Governor Booth Gardner and leaders of federally recognized tribes, is a framework for relations between the state and tribal governments. Representatives gather each year to take stock of how the relationship is evolving. Historically open to the media, this year’s event was closed to the press. 
Washington has several laws concerning interactions with tribes. Agencies must have a tribal liaison, for example. And there are already training mandates for employees.
In Wednesday’s meeting, tribal leaders said the executive order provides the heft needed to improve relations in a material way.
“It means a lot to Indian Country,” said Cindy Marchand, secretary of the Colville Confederated Tribes.
Kadi Bizyayeva, vice-chair of the Stillaguamish Tribe, told Ferguson the order “definitely demonstrates that you’re being perceptive of tribal concerns. I’m grateful for the opportunity to continue forging ahead and building relationships together with the state.”
Cowlitz Indian Tribe Chairman Bill Iyall, reached during the lunch break, said the provisions will solidify the executive branch’s commitment to consultation.
“In the past, it was mostly checking a box. This is a new mandate for early communication and regular communication,” he said.

Ferguson, in the meeting, said the order is a step toward ensuring sovereignty is respected and encouraged tribal leaders to reach out when it’s not working.
“For those of you who know me, you know, I don’t mind direct conversations,” he said. “I don’t take things personally if you’ve got a challenge with what’s going on with the state or a decision I’m making. Direct and candid. That’s how we move forward.”
Loni Greninger, vice chair of the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, did so a few minutes later. 
“Why is it so hard for the state to uphold trust and treaty obligations and other obligations that are described outside of treaties?” she said. “I want to ask this challenging question, to be transparent and to be direct, but also in a sense of how we figure this out together.”
She theorized it was because state laws get passed without taking those agreements into account. Those statutes become a barrier to finding a remedy, she surmised.
In response, Ferguson spoke more generally on how changing the culture of government is hard. The training envisioned in the executive order should expand knowledge of employees and lead to lasting change, he said.
Teri Gobin, chair of the Tulalip Tribes, flagged the importance of the training, noting that sometimes what is discussed with agency leaders is not passed down to the staff. “So thank you for moving ahead in this way and listening to our concern,” she said.
Another element of the executive order calls for protecting sensitive information, described as Indigenous Knowledge, exchanged in the course of government-to-government discussions. Tribes want to prevent information, such as locations of cultural resources, from being divulged.
“We’ve been victimized,” Iyall said, referring to when people disturb cultural sites or objects.
The Office of Indian Affairs must deliver a report to Ferguson by next October with recommendations for improvements to existing policies or practices.
The Centennial Accord meetings will continue Thursday with discussions on natural resources, education, state budget, tribal economies and health care.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sovereign-Tribes-EO-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 07:16:31.856665

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A collection of southeast Asian community advocates and elected officials gathered at St. Paul’s East Side Freedom Library in August for a press conference that felt more like a funeral. 
Deportations of southeast Asians were ramping up, and community leaders like Montha Chum of MN8, a southeast Asian political advocacy group, wanted to get word out about the deportations and their impact on families and the greater community. 
“We cannot stay silent when our communities are being torn apart and our neighbors are being kidnapped,” Chum said. 
Absent from the press conference, however, were the immediate family members of those deported. Instead, organizers read written statements from the deportees and their families — a tactic showing up frequently this year, a consequence of the heightened fear among immigrant communities. 
“They did not want to stand up and talk today…many of them are also still living in fear,” said MN8 volunteer Dieu Do, who read the statements from families. 
From one statement provided to MN8 by the wife of a man who was deported: “I feel like I’m barely surviving. I turned into a single parent overnight. We might lose our house. I don’t know where to turn to and I don’t know how I’m going to keep on doing this.”
Not long ago, undocumented immigrants were visible advocates on a range of issues, like winning drivers licenses and permanent legal status for so-called Dreamers, who were brought here as children.
Now, the primary priority is safety. 
The election of President Donald Trump to a second term — and his empowerment by a Republican-controlled Congress and conservative Supreme Court majority — has ushered in a new immigration crackdown that is instilling heightened fear in immigrant communities, causing most to retreat from the public eye. 
But it’s also motivating a new wave of advocates to get involved in organizing and protecting their immigrant neighbors, who are helping meet the surge in demand for “know your rights” trainings, which inform immigrants and allies of their constitutional rights.
In church basements, libraries and community centers around the state, immigrants are gathering to prepare for their lives to be upended at a moments’ notice. 
They’re filling out forms to designate caretakers for their children. They’re memorizing important phone numbers and stashing extra savings to cover potential attorney fees. They’re organizing their documents and making copies — passports, birth certificates, tax returns, bank account passwords, immigration paperwork — so friends and family can assist them in case of an arrest. 
It’s not just unauthorized immigrants who are preparing for the worst. It’s also people who came to the U.S. legally, by requesting asylum for fear of persecution in their home countries, obtaining a work visa or entering the country via Biden-era programs that have since been revoked.
“The federal administration has shown that even if you are someone who is here legally and have done all the things right, they will take any tool that they have — legally or illegally — to persecute you, and that’s really scary for folks who have a lot to lose,” Do said in an interview.

The immigration crackdown
Immigrants’ fears of speaking publicly are well-founded. The State Department has warned immigrants not to mock the death of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last month. Some immigrants with legal status have been detained over their speech, especially over support for Palestine. 
Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is ramping up arrests and deportations, pushing Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to meet quotas, boosted by $170 billion in spending approved by Congress in July. The president and his agency leaders have sued states including Minnesota for records they believe will help them track down undocumented people en masse and have accessed federal data — for example, at the IRS — for immigration enforcement, breaking longstanding precedent.
Masked ICE agents are routinely arresting immigrants who show up for court appointments, including at Minnesota’s Whipple Federal Building, according to immigrant rights groups.
At least 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE. Some were beaten, held for days or denied phone calls to their families or a lawyer, according to recent reporting by ProPublica.
More than 71% of ICE detainees have no criminal record — and many of those with criminal records have committed minor offenses, like traffic violations, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which uses public records to collect immigration data. 
And, in Minnesota, Republicans used their control of exactly half of the state House to force Democrats into a deal that would repeal undocumented adults’ eligibility for the subsidized health insurance MinnesotaCare.

Coordinating efforts
In early 2023, Minnesota’s immigrant rights movement was standing on the precipice of several major policy wins that would improve undocumented Minnesotans’ security, health care access and college education. 
Undocumented people testified publicly in support of legislation that would go on to become law: allowing qualified undocumented Minnesota residents to obtain drivers’ licenses, purchase state-subsidized health insurance and access new scholarships, among others. 
The legislative wins of 2023 demonstrated the effectiveness of coalition building — Immigrant rights groups worked alongside labor unions, business groups, faith communities and environmental advocates to pass shared priorities at the Legislature. 
“A special thing about Minnesota is a long history of working in coalition across unusual lines,” said Merle Payne, co-director of Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en la Lucha (CTUL), a workers rights organization.
Many of those same organizations continue working together, but now they’re focused on disseminating information, helping individuals and providing know-your-rights trainings.

The demand for the trainings has massively increased since Trump’s election, said Latifah Moss, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, or MIRAC. 
MIRAC has also seen a large influx of members and volunteers in recent years — first in the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd, then again after the start of Israel’s bombing campaigns in Gaza, and again after Trump’s election. 
“I think that there definitely has been that increase of people wanting to stand up and do something or organize,” Moss said. 
Ma Elena Gutierrez, executive director of Fe y Justicia, a workers and immigrants rights nonprofit, said her organization has provided more than 30 trainings this year for immigrants and allies — and interest is at a record high from non-immigrant community members. 
MIRAC is also training court observers. Some accompany immigrants to their court hearings upon request; others stand in the hallways or sit in courtrooms to witness and document court proceedings and ICE arrests.
The influx of interested volunteers has boosted organizations’ capacity. 
“In the long term, I hope that the folks who have joined in this wave and have joined following Trump’s second election stay for the long haul of immigrant rights,” said Do, who is also an organizer with MIRAC.

Waiting for the big shoe to drop
It seems that it’s not a question of if, but when, the Trump administration will send the National Guard to the Twin Cities. 
“It’d be logical for them to come here. We fall into exactly what it looks like they’re trying to target — blue cities in places that he wants to make an impact,” Gov. Tim Walz said in early October. 
A smoky, rainy weekday in early June demonstrated what Minnesotans’ pushback against federal force might look like. 
Federal agents from DHS, FBI, IRS, ICE and other agencies surrounded a Lake Street taco shop in vans and armored vehicles around midday on Tuesday, June 3, as part of what they later called a “drug smuggling and criminal labor trafficking” investigation. On the scene, the purpose of the raid wasn’t clear; some agents refused to say what agency they were with, and many wore masks.

Local officials and immigrant rights advocates rushed to the scene and shared information on social media, quickly attracting a large crowd that spilled onto the streets around the restaurant. 
Armed federal agents and officers from the Minneapolis Police Department and Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office formed a perimeter around the building as protesters shouted at them to go home.
Protesters attempted to block the movement of armored vehicles and vans before agents began launching chemical irritants and using sound cannons to disperse the crowd. 
Local and state officials later denounced the raid. 
“It seemed like the point was to inflict terror and fear into the community,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the following day. 
Trump has deployed ICE in Chicago to “target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. He also ordered the the National Guard to the city to protect immigration agents. 
The National Guard has already been mobilized in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago and Memphis, while court orders have blocked Trump’s attempts to deploy National Guard members in Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.
And, “The government isn’t exactly doing a great job of proactively delineating this person is National Guard who isn’t allowed to arrest immigrants, and this person is an ICE agent or an FBI agent who is,” Dara Lind, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told NPR last week. 
That’s creating fear among immigrants of a National Guard mobilization.
Gutierrez is telling immigrants to stay home if the National Guard comes to town. 
When a community member is deported, she said, the remaining friends and family are left behind to fill in the gaps in income, housing and child care.
But she’s trying to keep hope alive. “If we can survive COVID, we can survive this,” Gutierrez said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NN250714_527-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 07:16:31.856665

(Screenshot of livestream)The Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission met Wednesday for the first time — manned only by Hoosier members — to consider absorbing secessionist Illinois counties.
Prairie State Gov. J.B. Pritzker has dubbed it “a stunt” that is “not going to happen.” No Illinoisans were named to the panel.
Instead, a six-member Indiana quorum conducted business in Terre Haute, taking remote — and mixed — testimony from residents of both states. The meeting was livestreamed.
Since 2020, 33 Illinois counties have passed “advisory referenda” to secede — with seven of those votes occurring in the 2024 elections.
Scott Carpenter of Downstate Illinois Secession said redrawing borders would be “freeing” Prairie State residents from “bad Illinois law.”
He suggested absorbing 74 counties that had a higher share of support for President Donald Trump during the 2020 election than Indiana — or, a smaller number of eastern counties with a higher average income than Indiana.
“Some might argue that this whole border adjustment commission is a waste of time because the government of Illinois would not agree to let these counties go,” Carpenter said. But a debt crisis could force the state’s hand, he added.
“Your commission is an opportunity to sound sound out and settle on a politically expedient solution that can be repackaged and presented to the public in such a time of crisis,” he said.
It’s unclear how Indiana would handle the issue of debt.

Illinois has almost $250 billion in liabilities, according to a 2024 analysis by the Reason Foundation, a Libertarian think tank. Indiana, meanwhile, is running a modest surplus.
“We are essentially a drain on … Illinois, and they remind us of that regularly,” said fellow Downstate Illinois Secession member Eric Ivers. He argued those counties would be “much more productive” under Indiana’s governance.
“We would no longer have to deal with the limitations placed on us by Chicago,” Ivers added.
Those pushing to create a new state spoke against absorption.
G.H. Merritt, who chairs the board of New Illinois, said that would “undermine our efforts to … escape from ‘Old Illinois.'”
She envisions 101 of the Prairie State’s counties seceding — every one besides Chicago’s Cook County.
Merritt claimed the commission was just for show. She recounted a phone call with the office of Republican Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, who authored the law creating the commission.
“The gentleman’s first question to me was, ‘Why do you want to do this?’ And my reply to him is, ‘Why do you want to do this?'” she told the commission.

“… The debt would be just make this prohibitively expensive. And so what he told me is that Indiana knew this was never going to happen because Gov. Pritzker would never appoint the Illinois commissioners to this group,” Merritt said. “He told me that Indiana’s motive for doing this was to send a message to Gov. Pritzker and (Chicago) Mayor (Brandon) Johnson to correct course.”
Molly Gillaspie, a spokeswoman for Huston, wrote that he’s “always pursued this in earnest while acknowledging it was not very likely” that Illinois would send appointees.
Companion legislation in Illinois was unsuccessful.
“When a third of counties in Illinois have expressed their dissatisfaction and voted to secede from their state, I’d say you should take that seriously,” Huston said in a statement. “We certainly take it seriously, we hear their frustrations, and we welcome them to the Hoosier State. I look forward to hearing the Commission’s recommendations on a path forward, and if and when Illinois comes to the table, we will be ready.”
Laurette Newland, with Illinois Separation Referendum, said her group has three factions: some would like to join a neighboring state, some seek a new state, and some don’t care “as long as Cook County is not in it.”
Illinois Separation Referendum has led the secession referenda campaign. Newland noted that voters were only asked about separating, not about joining Indiana. She recommended posing that question to voters before further legislative action.
A border shakeup of this magnitude is unlikely, however.
Illinois would need to approve the move, alongside Indiana. Then, it’d head to Congress for additional vetting.
The commission agreed to “shoot for” a meeting early next year, but hasn’t yet set a date.
Members include: Chair Jeff Papa, chief of staff and general counsel for the Indiana Senate; Vice Chair Greg Newman, a CPA who also serves as Posey County commissioner and GOP chair; Clay Andrews, a farmer, commissioner and GOP chair in Warren County; former state Rep. Don Lehe; Ray McCammon, a farmer and former Sullivan County commissioner; and Mark Seib, a semi-retired farmer from Posey County.

That’s a recent survey response from a teacher in Washington state.
Without the distraction of cellphones, students engage more with their teachers and peers. They use class time to focus on assignments, and teaching feels more like it did when I first started 20 years ago.
Based on what we’re reading in the literature, observing in classrooms, and most importantly, hearing from teachers, the message from educators across Washington is loud and clear: cellphone policies, when paired with consistent enforcement, are making a positive impact. In contrast, weak enforcement leads to poor results.
I observe about 150 high school classrooms a year, bringing a decade of experience, meaning I was in classrooms both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In fall 2024, one classroom stood out. I should say — it grabbed my attention. 
Before, during, and after the lesson, students were actively participating and discussing the material. This level of engagement has been rare lately. The teacher attributed the change to a new, strictly enforced policy prohibiting phone use. I thought about that classroom for the entire two-hour drive to my next classroom.
This wasn’t an isolated case. Throughout the fall and winter, I encountered more classrooms with similar energy. Each time, the teacher mentioned a change in cellphone policy. One day, after I left a classroom that shared this same positive environment, I passed a sign in the hallway: “From bell to bell, there is no cell!”
The consensus among these teachers from these classrooms was clear: changing the policy wasn’t difficult. The key was to start the year with a unified commitment from staff to enforce it consistently. Over time, even students began to appreciate the benefits. While my observations are anecdotal, they were compelling.
Calling on survey data for insights
In early spring this year, my colleagues and I surveyed nearly 300 teachers and received 212 responses within a week — a high return rate. Our validity check confirmed four key factors and a moderate reliability score. We used professional statistical software to analyze the data and even submitted open-ended responses to ChatGPT for collation.
The survey revealed a nuanced and often frustrating reality. While many educators report improved student behavior when policies are consistently enforced, inconsistent application, lack of administrative support, and student addiction to devices undermine these efforts.
Teachers also report several obstacles in enforcing phone policies effectively. 
One major issue is inconsistent enforcement across staff, which undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the rules. Additionally, many teachers feel a lack of administrative support, making it difficult to uphold policies with authority. 
Student defiance, often fueled by phone addiction, presents a daily challenge, as does parental pushback, which can weaken the school’s resolve to maintain strict guidelines.
When phone policies are enforced, teachers reported positive changes such as increased student engagement, more peer interaction, improved social skills, and a stronger classroom presence. 
Distractions are minimized, and incidents of cheating are reduced. However, when enforcement is lax, the opposite occurs — students show decreased focus and participation, behavioral issues rise, and the overall learning environment deteriorates.
To address these challenges, teachers who responded to the survey recommended a complete bell-to-bell phone ban, centralized phone storage during class, consistent enforcement by all staff members, and a system of clear, progressive consequences for violations.
A smaller group of teachers advocated for policies allowing teacher discretion for educational use of phones. Even among them, the need for clear guidelines and safeguards against misuse was emphasized.
The survey paints a picture of schools grappling with the pervasive influence of personal technology. While positive change is possible, it requires clear policies and consistent enforcement. 
Teachers are calling for a unified approach to create a more focused and engaging learning environment for students. But it’ll take support from administrators and parents for classroom cellphone bans — and the benefits they can offer — to successfully take hold.

Members of the subcommittee heard comments from both the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Michigan Economic Development Foundation, two distinct groups aimed at supporting the state’s economic development. The Michigan Economic Development Corporation acts as a public-private partnership with the state, while the foundation is a private nonprofit.
Although international trade missions are neither new under Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration, nor unique to Michigan’s economic development efforts, the subcommittee probed both groups on the money they spent sending the governor abroad, and any connections between the quasi-government agency and the private foundation. 
The subcommittee first invited Christin Armstrong, the Economic Development Corporation’s chief operating and performance officer and Michelle Grinnell, the corporation’s chief communications and attractions officer to discuss the history of overseas investment missions, and how each governor’s agenda shapes the investments they seek. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since the Michigan Economic Development Corporation was created during GOP Governor John Engler’s administration, every governor’s administration has taken part in international investment missions into key markets overseas, Grinnell said, noting that relationships in markets like Italy, Germany and Japan have carried over between administrations. 
Grinnell said these missions aim to develop and maintain business relationships that help deliver jobs and opportunities to Michigan residents, noting that nearly 322,000 workers in the state are employed as a result of international investment, according to data from the Global Business Alliance. He added that nearly every other state, including those Michigan competes with for jobs, investment, and talent, employs similar strategies.
While Armstrong noted the funds for these trips do not come from taxpayer dollars, the committee’s vice chairs, Rep. Jaime Greene (R-Richmond) and Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), noted that those dollars are still part of public funds, with 89% of the Economic Development Corporation’s budget coming from a portion of the revenue generated by tribal casinos and online gambling. 
The Corporation makes recommendations for international trade missions based on opportunities for deals that could be closed and areas where markets are emerging based on the state’s economic strategy, Armstrong explained, noting that the economic development corporation does host missions without the governor’s participation.
In response to a question from subcommittee Chair Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), Grinnell said the governor’s investment missions can range from $70,000 to as high as $470,000, noting that the larger figure was for a trip to three separate countries.
“We try to do as much as we can in one trip, versus doing many one off trips,” Grinnell said.

While Grinnell acknowledged that the Michigan Economic Development Foundation does help pay for these trips and does coordinate with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, Armstrong emphasized that they are two financially and legally separate entities. 
Armstrong and Grinnell did not have a detailed breakdown of expenses between the two entities but said they would provide that information later. Armstrong estimated the MEDC spent just under $1 million on investment missions this year.
While the Economic Development Corporation could lead these trips without funding from the foundation, Armstrong said that would create a funding constraint issue. 
Lawmakers also pressed the MEDC on public access to trip costs, with Greene noting that citizens must file a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain details.
Eric Doster, legal counsel for the Michigan Economic Development Foundation, defended the foundation’s transparency. He said its board members are listed in annual reports filed with the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and in tax forms available on the Internal Revenue Service’s website.
“This annual tax return is not short [it] lists how much income the foundation receives in a given tax year and how much it spends on things like investment missions and conferences in the aggregate,” Doster said, noting that the foundation also releases an annual report on its website detailing its board level partners and its activities.

However, as a private charity, the foundation is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act or the Open Meetings Act, Doster noted. He also reiterated that the foundation is separate from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, with the foundation preceding the corporation by 15 years. 
In response to a question from Wegela, Doster said the foundation does not disclose direct donors outside of its board partners who give $25,000 or more. It also does not list the foundation’s line-item expenses. 
When asked if the foundation would be open to disclosing its line item expenses and line item donors to the public, Doster said no. 
“We’re not required by law. I mean, are you going to the Red Cross and asking a similar question? Are you going to Sparrow hospital and asking them a similar question?”, Doster asked.
Wegela argued the situation is different because board-level donors include major corporations such as Delta Air Lines, Ford, General Motors, Consumers Energy and Delta Dental, whose money helps fund the governor’s travel.
He also noted that two members of the MEDC’s board — whose members are appointed by the governor — also serve on the foundation’s board.

A 2024 tax filing shared by ProPublica shows that Sarah Gonzales of Delta Air Lines and Kelly Hall of CMS Energy both serve on the executive committee of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and on the board of the Michigan Economic Development Foundation.
In an email to the Michigan Advance, Courtney Overbey, vice president of communications for the Economic Development Corporation further emphasized the separation between the two entities. 
“The [corporation] does not presume to determine or decide participation by companies in an independent non-profit – the executive board at [the foundation] is chosen by [foundation] members, and the executive committee at [the corporation] is appointed by the governor.” Overbey said. 
There are also protocols in place to ensure that as the foundation seeks out new donors, that those companies do not have projects in the economic development corporation’s pipeline, Overbey said. 
Wegela also noted that Whitmer serves as the foundation’s ex officio chair, a role Doster described as “more of an honorary position than a functionary one,” though the governor occasionally attends board meetings.
This drew concerns from both Carra and Wegela. 
“The fact that the governor…was chair of the [foundation] while being governor of the state of Michigan and having the [economic development corporation] underneath her executive branch, to me, is a clear, questionable dynamic,” Carra said. 
Carra suggested companies could support the governor’s agenda by donating to the foundation, sidestepping campaign finance limits.
When asked about the governor’s role as an honorary member of the foundation’s board, a spokesperson for the Governor’s office declined to comment and instead directed the Michigan Advance to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.
Foundation Executive Director Rebecca Bahar Cook and Overbey both said the role is not unique to Whitmer’s tenure and stressed that the governor has no control over the foundation’s board.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Ellie Lazarcik worked in a few different industry jobs after moving to Madison in 2017. None of them really fit, she says. Then she learned that the U.S. Forest Service Forest Products Lab in Madison was hiring.
Coincidentally, she knew of the lab from a visit she made “way back when I was in college, for a wood sculpture class of all things,” Lazarcik said Wednesday.
“Over a decade had passed since then, and I saw a job opening come up in the lab and thought, ‘Why not? That place was really amazing when I visited. They had really cool stuff going on then, and they probably still have really cool stuff going on,’” she recalled.
She applied and got the job.

That was five years ago. Her job title is physical science technician in the lab’s building and fire science program. Her work supports other members of the research team — setting up lab tests, preparing samples and then running them through the testing or analysis process and sorting through the data afterward.
“And I love what I do,” Lazarcik said.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, “there have been a lot of really sort of rapid-fire changes,” she said. “We’re on our toes a lot trying to figure out what we can or can’t pursue in terms of research.”
Still, she has continued to find the job engaging. “We’ve been able to keep doing cool projects,” Lazarcik said. “I’ve been involved in some interesting stuff in the lab — but it has been challenging.”
Since Oct. 1, however, Lazarcik has been furloughed along with hundreds of thousands of federal workers on account of the federal government shutdown.
“This is my first furlough and I’m not particularly enjoying it,” she said. Missing a paycheck is one reason, but it’s not the only one.
“It is pretty uncomfortable not knowing when I will get paid next, when I can go back into the lab and continue working on projects that got stopped abruptly,” Lazarcik said, “It’s stressful.”
Lazarcik is married and  her husband “has a job and a paycheck, which definitely helps,” she said. “But going from a two-paycheck household to one has been a pretty stark difference.”
On Wednesday, Lazarcik brought her toddler in his stroller over to the Social Security Administration office on Madison’s far West Side. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth) and members of his staff stopped by a little after noon with boxes of pizza as a token of appreciation for some of the furloughed federal workers.
About 18,000 federal employees live in Wisconsin, and about 8,000 are expected to be out of work currently due to the shutdown, the state labor secretary, Amy Pechacek, said at a virtual news conference on Thursday, Oct. 18.
“We’re seeing you and we very much appreciate what you’re doing,” Pocan told the group of just over a dozen federal employees who turned out. “We understand the sacrifice you and your families are making.”
Even before the shutdown, the Trump administration fired about 200,000 federal workers, Pocan said.
“These actions are illegal,” he said, but added that they are likely to drive some people out of the federal workforce. “We’re going to lose a lot of good, qualified people with experience.”
Pocan said communication in Washington, D.C., between the Republican majority in both the House and the Senate and Democrats has been at a standstill.
“I’d prefer we were there now, negotiating to get things done. But we’re not,” Pocan told the group. “We’re seeing a lot of things happen this session that aren’t normal.”
In September the Republicans sought to pass a continuing resolution on spending that if enacted would have averted the shutdown. A majority voted for the measure in the House, but in the U.S. Senate there were not enough votes to clear the 60 needed to advance most bills in the upper chamber.
Democratic support is necessary to meet that threshold, but Democratic lawmakers argued that in return for their votes they should have an opportunity to have some input into the continuing resolution.
Their demands have included extending enhanced subsidies for health insurance premiums sold through the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace and reversing cuts to Medicaid that Republicans included in their big tax cut and spending cut bill enacted in July.
In previous spending standoffs, Pocan said, leaders of both parties in both houses of Congress have been able to hash out agreements, usually avoiding a shutdown altogether or else managing to resolve one before it drags on.
“This time, though, so much has changed,” Pocan said.
A bipartisan deal failed in December after Trump and Elon Musk opposed it. Congress managed to approve another stopgap spending bill two days later that carried the federal government to March 2025.
“Then we had to start over in March,” Pocan said. That measure was unpopular with Democrats, he said, but enough Senate Democrats voted for it to pass,  funding the federal government through Sept. 30.
“And immediately we saw recissions — illegal again — and more illegal actions by the Trump administration taking funds away,” Pocan said. That history over the last 10 months has made Democrats wary of a deal that doesn’t address their priorities, he added.
Lazarcik hopes Congress acts soon to pass legislation that ends the shutdown. In the meantime, she gets by, tapping into savings, “looking at where you can squeeze a little bit tighter,” and skimping on putting aside funds for retirement — “which is really hard.”
Not everyone understands, however.
“I hear a lot  of people talk about, ‘Oh, man, that must be cool.’ It’s really not,” she said. “It’s pretty stressful having to try to plan when you can’t know when your next paycheck is coming.”
She is grateful for a support network of close friends and family members. “[They] do understand furlough is not just some crazy vacation you get to go on,” Lazarcik said.
The forest products lab has had a strong feeling of community that Lazarcik has always enjoyed. That has persisted during furlough, “even in this time when we’re not all going to the same building every day.”
Coworkers have stayed connected, reaching out to each other to meet up, talk and “de-stress,” Lazarcik said. “Even though we’re not all working on a regular schedule and we’re not getting paychecks, we still are supporting each other, and that’s been really great.”

The Attorney General’s Office launched Arrive Together in 2021 as an effort to decrease police use of force against civilians experiencing behavioral health issues. It started as a program in Cumberland County and has since expanded to all 21 counties, with state officials saying there have been no serious injuries to either officers or civilians in 12,000 interactions.
“We hope that no matter who is elected, that they not only keep this program in place, but would continue to build on it,” said Surraya Johnson, director of the criminal justice reform program at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.
The program — Arrive stands for Alternative Responses to Reduce Instances of Violence and Escalation — has been championed by Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, and Attorney General Matt Platkin, both of whom are departing in January when a new governor is sworn in.
The front-runners vying on Nov. 4 to replace Murphy, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill, both extol Arrive Together, though Ciattarelli indicated that if elected, he may revamp the program. He said police officers need to know the next governor “has their back” in these situations.

Ciattarelli, who has criticized Murphy and Platkin for “handcuffing” law enforcement, said he wants to sit down with police officers and mental health experts to decide how to handle police response to people with mental health issues. He has called Arrive Together a “thoughtful attempt” to handle this issue.
“I have a responsibility to be a foot deep in all subject matter, but I’m going to sit down with the people who are a mile deep,” he said at an event in Long Branch Wednesday.
Sherrill said when she was a federal prosecutor, she saw firsthand how programs that build trust between law enforcement and communities “help keep people safe.” Sherrill was briefly an assistant U.S. attorney, and before then worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office as an outreach and reentry coordinator.

“That’s why as governor, I will support programs like Arrive Together and hospital-based violence prevention programs that deliver effective treatment while reducing use of force. We can also prevent crime in the first place with programs that give New Jerseyans opportunity, such as summer youth employment, workforce training, and even by investing in early childhood education programs like Head Start,” she said in a statement from her campaign.
Johnson said her organization hopes to meet with both candidates to explain why Arrive Together should continue and how it has improved public safety and communities. If the next governor chooses not to continue the program, “it would be a disappointment,” she said.
“I think it makes New Jersey less safe when there is not a mental health professional on scene to respond to mental health crises,” she said.
The program launched in 2021 in Cumberland County, but expanded to other counties in the midst of high-profile police killings of people experiencing mental health crises. Paterson police shot and killed Najee Seabrooks in March 2023 after cops say he lunged at them with a knife following a five-hour standoff. Jersey City police shot and killed Andrew Washington in August 2023 when cops say he rushed out of his apartment with a knife. In both instances, the victims’ families say they needed mental health help, not police intervention.
Arrive Together, which public policy group the Brookings Institution says is the first program of its kind in the nation, received about $20 million in state funding in the current $58.8 billion budget.
Murphy spokeswoman Tyler Jones lauded the program as one that is “pioneering a new approach” to mental health response.
“This program can serve as a national model for law enforcement agencies across the country, helping them to strengthen trust and build stronger bonds between officers and the communities they serve,” she said.

Located in the Payette National Forest in Valley County near the small town of Yellow Pine, Stibnite Gold Mine has been the site of mining since around 1899. Mining continued through the 20th century and produced metals used by America during World War II. 
However, mining ceased by the 1990s and Stibnite was abandoned, leaving arsenic and sediment pollution in the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River, which is an important habitat for endangered salmon, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Several conservation groups and the Nez Perce Tribe, which have opposed the mine for years, say the new plans for the mine will cause even more harm to the environment, put the public at risk and harm salmon. 
 Mine’s owner, Perpetua Resources, say Stibnite is unique source of antimony

A company called Perpetua Resources, which was formerly known as Midas Gold, bought the old Stibnite mine site and plans to resume mining for gold, silver and the chemical element antimony at Stibnite.

“Today, we break ground on the Stibnite Gold Project,” Perpetua Resources President and CEO Jon Cherry said in a written statement issued Tuesday. “As America’s answer to China’s antimony export bans, we are focused on swiftly and safely bringing our antimony and gold project into development. After nine years of permitting, Stibnite can once again serve this country’s national interest. We are proud of our work to bring this essential project online to provide critical resources while restoring an abandoned mine site. With our reclamation performance bond to reclaim the work we undertake at the Project site in place, we officially started early works construction today and are making good on our promises to Idaho and America.”  
Perpetua Resources officials have told the Sun that Stibnite represents a unique source of antimony in America, and that antimony can be used in making batteries and ammunition. 
But the mine’s opponents have said the real crux of the mine – as reflected in the name Stibnite Gold Project – is gold. 
Perpetua Resources executives said they expect the project to create up to 950 jobs during construction and 550 jobs during mining operations. 
Overall, Perpetua Resources said the permitting process took nine years and their team has followed all of the required steps and laws. 
 Conservationists say real construction, operations can’t start until legal challenges resolved

In January, the U.S. Forest Service issued a final record of decision approving the Stibnite Gold Project, but the Idaho Conservation League, the Nez Perce Tribe and other conservation groups have filed lawsuits challenging and appealing the approval, arguing that the U.S. Forest Service failed to consider the project’s impacts on fish, wildlife and the environment and on the air that members of the public and mine workers breathe. 
Two officials with the Idaho Conservation League, Regulatory Conservation Associate Will Tiedemann and Public Lands and Wildlife Director John Robinson, told the Idaho Capital Sun on Wednesday that there are at least four active lawsuits or appeals challenging Stibnite’s approval. 
They described Tuesday’s groundbreaking as a limited, preliminary groundbreaking and said real construction and operations could not begin unless or until the legal challenges are resolved.   
“There are significant questions as to will this mine ever happen or not,” Tiedemann said Wednesday. 
Perpetua Resources officials say that a major portion of their plan involves cleaning up some of the legacy pollution and waste left by the previous operators of Stibnite Gold Mine. Perpetua Resources officials have also promised to build a fish passage tunnel that would reroute the East Fork of the South Fork of the Salmon River away from the Yellow Pine Pit, which now blocks the fish in. 
“The Stibnite Gold Project can deliver decisive wins for our communities, the environment, the economy and our national security,” Cherry, Perpetua Resources’ president and CEO, previously said. 
But Tiedemann and Robinson said Perpetua Resource’s proposal is more about public relations and making money than actually helping salmon and cleaning up the environment. 
Tiedemann and Robinson said Perpetua Resource’s plans call for disturbing an even larger section of the forest than the historic mine ever impacted and building 15 miles of new mining haul roads right on the border of the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. They also allege that air quality rules have been set aside or ignored for Stibnite.

“It’s safe to say this is one of the most pristine areas around, on the border of the Frank Church (wilderness),” Robinson said. “When you’re in the (site where the new mining road will be built), looking at the at the wildlife there, looking at the landscape, the undisturbed nature of it, the remoteness of it, it really is indistinguishable from the Frank Church, in terms of just the qualities of solitude there.”
“We’re hoping that through the legal system we’re going to be able to put a pause on the project and have it sent back to the drawing board to see if you can do it in a much better way,” Robinson added.

(Getty Images)Too many kids slip through the cracks in our classrooms. That’s a hard statement, but it’s true.
Absenteeism is a significant problem; students lose interest as they advance through school, and nationwide scores in reading and math remain stubbornly low.
In 2024, the Nation’s Report Card revealed that just 22% of 12th graders reached proficiency in math, while only 35% did so in reading. Additionally, while Indiana’s chronic absenteeism rate fell to 16.7% in 2024-25, the challenge continues to affect far too many students. By the time many reach high school, they’ve checked out of a system that feels unimportant to their lives.
Fifty-three percent of Indiana’s high school graduates move on to attend a four-year college or university, and about half of those students graduate on time. The need to reinvent school is evident in attendance rates, test scores and lost opportunities.
This points to one truth: our education system wasn’t built for the world our students are growing up in — and it’s time to change that.
Here in Indiana, we are proving that there is a better way forward.
Five Indiana high schools are part of a national movement to create a new educational architecture that encompasses a broader set of goals, rigorous and engaging learning experiences and meaningful signals.
Chronic absenteeism continues to improve in Indiana schools, new state data shows

The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and XQ Institute selected Concord High School, Portage School of Leaders, Eastern Hancock High School, Purdue Polytechnic High School and RAZ 32 to join the Future of High School network.
Nationwide, 24 school systems serving 90,000 students have begun the work of redesigning high schools to ensure that learning is connected to real-world opportunities.
What skills do we truly want students to develop during high school? The goal is simple: to make high school relevant and create future opportunities for students.
This isn’t about making minor adjustments; it’s about fundamentally changing school. Imagine a school where learning is directly tied to careers in healthcare, artificial intelligence, or advanced manufacturing — a place where students earn market-driven credentials, secure paid apprenticeships, and earn college credits. Sometimes, the most authentic learning experiences occur outside of the four walls of a classroom. Employers see students not as future hires, but as partners in building Indiana’s economy now.
With leaders like Indiana’s Secretary of Education Katie Jenner and Fairbanks Foundation President and CEO Clair Fiddian-Green, the state is charting a bold new course.
Jenner spearheaded the redesign of the high school diploma to open doors for meaningful partnerships between schools and industry. Building on that momentum, the CEMETS iLab group has brought together schools and employers to create apprenticeship pipelines that develop talent and prepare students for promising futures.
Indiana education officials green-light high school diploma overhaul

Five years ago, Ben struggled to find value in school. Today, as a senior in South Bend, he’s thriving — and his story shows the power of connecting school to industry. Through the Career Academy Student Enterprise Corporation, Ben has earned multiple certifications while running a student-led business that fulfills real orders for manufacturers using a Haas computer numerical control, or CNC, machine. Ben plans to open his own automotive custom fabrication shop one day.
This statewide collaborative approach is resulting in academic gains. Indiana posted historic achievement results increasing reading proficiency by nearly 5% last school year.
In 2024, Indiana’s reading scores soared, with the National Assessment of Educational Progress ranking 4th graders 6th in the nation (up from 19th) and 8th graders 6th (up from 17th). Change is possible.
Let’s be clear — this progress benefits everyone. When schools create opportunities, it doesn’t just help students; it helps employers fill critical jobs, boosts economic growth, and fosters social mobility for families. Schools will become engines of opportunity, businesses will grow, and communities will become stronger.
The wind is at our backs, with school leaders, employers, and nonprofit partners moving in the same direction. The question is whether we will seize this moment together. The call to action is clear: school systems cannot do this alone. To build an education system that truly prepares young people for the future, we need everyone — especially the business community — to rally behind us.
We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to construct a new educational architecture. Let’s not waste it. Our children — and Indiana’s future — depend on it.

Oklahoma lawmakers said conversations and negotiations will continue during the interim as they grapple with how to regulate the continued growth of the wind industry and an increased demand for power production.
Both supporters and opponents say they’re wrestling with how to balance economic development needs and property rights and how much more government influence is needed for future developments. 
At an interim study last month, attendees painted starkly different views of what they see as the path forward for an industry that’s been operating in Oklahoma for over 20 years and has already erected over 5,500 turbines in over 80 locations. 
Republican legislators said there are discussions about how far wind turbines should be from people’s property lines and homes, more commonly known as setbacks. They’re also considering how much input, if any, counties should have in setting regulations as they work to balance the demand for increased energy consumption that wind energy helps alleviate.

Rep. Nick Archer, R-Elk City, said even though he doesn’t like wind energy, the issue isn’t about his personal feelings. He said as a landowner whose property abuts another with 16 wind turbines, he hasn’t experienced any of the issues or health and safety risks that anti-wind advocates have brought to the table.
“Just because they don’t like it, they want government to come in and stop it,” said Archer, who chairs the House Energy Committee. “But there are unintended consequences to everything we do in this building. And if we get tunnel vision to stop one thing, it’s not going to end well.”
Archer said many of the arguments he hears against wind energy are “anecdotal,” and based on worst-case scenarios. He said when he took a closer look at reports, data and studies provided by the anti-wind advocates, many were not peer reviewed. 
“We talk about transportation, we talk about agriculture, we talk about the oil and gas industry,” Archer said. “We regulate those health and safety issues to reasonable risk standards. We don’t regulate them to the one in a million catastrophic outlier. If we did that, it would drastically change all industries within the state.”
A 2024 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found that Oklahoma’s generation of electricity increased by 25% between 2010 and 2023, with almost all of the growth coming from wind energy. Oklahoma was the nation’s third-largest wind energy producing state following Texas and Iowa in 2023, the report found. 
Lawmakers previously ended wind tax credits, so new developments are not subsidized by the state. Some older developments may be receiving some government assistance because they were grandfathered in, but those benefits are set to sunset soon.
“There are some folks in the state that would prefer never to see another wind turbine erected across the state,” said Mark Yates, Oklahoma executive director for the Advanced Power Alliance. “But I think that we know what a value add that wind has been to the economy and to our grid system writ large.”
He said Oklahoma is the “gold standard” of energy production, and there’s always been a “thoughtful and reasonable” approach to it. The Advanced Power Alliance advocates for clean energy and policies that “grow the use of a strategic mix of American energy resources.”
With the growth of artificial intelligence has come an increased need for data centers and the power to run the massive facilities that store servers and process data. The computing power of these centers often strain the availability of resources like electricity and water for local communities. 
Data centers have been built, or are in the process of being approved, in places like Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Stillwater, Pyror and Owasso. There are more than 30 in Oklahoma, according to the Data Center Map. 
“We have an unbelievable stress coming when it comes to power generation and the amount of electricity that is going to be needed in this country,” Yates said. “So whether it’s the federal government or the state government or local governments throwing additional impediments to slow or to block projects, it’s a massive, massive issue.”
Local control

Rep. Jim Shaw, R-Chandler, who co-hosted a recent interim study with Archer, said while he said he isn’t sure what exactly that legislation may look like, he wants to see elements of local control so voters can have input on setbacks at the county level. 
The state already has varying setback requirements for industries like oil and gas and agriculture, so Shaw said it wouldn’t be unreasonable to have similar regulations for wind developments.
Last session, lawmakers considered a bill that proposed quarter mile setbacks. Those weren’t enough, Shaw said.
“The biggest argument that is being used right now is that ‘It’s my property. I can do whatever I want. You can’t tell me what to do on my property,’ and that’s just simply not true,” Shaw said. “When you conduct an activity or do something on your property that negatively impacts the way of life and the livelihood of those around you, and that activity extends beyond the four corners of your property, that absolutely has to be a conversation that has to be had.”
Landowners who chose to sign contracts with wind developers often do so as a way to earn extra income from their land. 
John O’Connor, a former Republican Oklahoma attorney general, said there’s legal precedent to leave the decisions on setbacks to local counties. 
“I think no matter what you do on this committee, if it’s a setback, if it’s a statewide anything, you are affecting property rights,” he said. “You’re impairing the rights of somebody, either the owner who wants to make the lease or the neighbor who doesn’t want the lease next to them.”

Lisa Linowes, executive director of the WindAction Group, an organization working to inform people of potential risks of large-scale wind energy projects, said wind generation is not a reliable energy source because wind isn’t always blowing at high speeds. She said it also creates an “industrialized landscape,” referring to the towering turbines that can reach hundreds of feet into the sky. 
“You cannot run a grid system, you can’t run a business on generation that shows up and disappears at that rate and that level of variability,” she said. 
Virginia Pflum, a landowner in Noble and Logan counties, said she leased her land to a wind energy development and has experienced property damage in the form of holes in her fields and locked gates that hindered access to her land. 
Others said they worried about potential damage to property by ice falling from turbines or mechanical malfunctions and noise nuisance. 
Alan Anderson, an energy lawyer with Polsinelli law firm, said he’s worked with wind and solar projects across the country. 
The ideal setback is 1.1 times the height of a turbine from the neighboring property line and 2 times the height from a residence, Anderson said. Several other states adhere to these setbacks, he said, because this is not something lawmakers have to “guess” at. 
“We have the answers,” Anderson said. “So amazingly, this is not a political question. … Science and engineering don’t have a party. They just have answers.”

Meanwhile, lawmakers say they’ll pursue a court order requiring the clerk to appear after she failed to comply with a subpoena requiring her to attend a meeting.
The post Complaints task Gordon with investigating Weston County clerk, again appeared first on WyoFile .","Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock kept her job following a state investigation earlier this year into an error by her office that caused inaccurate vote counts during the 2024 election. But she’s now the subject of twin inquiries by two branches of Wyoming government.
Four of Hadlock’s constituents submitted official complaints to Gov. Mark Gordon’s office on Monday.
Meanwhile, a legislative committee announced Tuesday it will pursue a court order requiring the clerk to appear before the panel after she did not comply with a subpoena to attend a September meeting in Casper. 
The issue dates back to the 2024 general election when Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results after using the wrong ballots, causing a dramatic undercount in the vote for Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, who was running unopposed. Ultimately, a hand count sorted out the results, but the issue remained unresolved for many Weston County voters, including several who asked the Wyoming State Canvassing Board not to certify the results of the election. 
“I would like to state that if you certify this election, knowing that one county found flipped votes, and no other counties have been checked by hand, that you’re damaging the integrity of Wyoming,” Weston County resident Susan Love told the board at the time. 
Love is now among the four local voters who submitted the new formal complaint to Gordon’s office. 
“The complaints outline two new charges regarding the Weston County Clerk: Clerk Hadlock’s filing of a false post election audit following the 2024 general election and Clerk Hadlock’s refusal to comply with a legislative subpoena issued by the Management Audit Committee in violation of Wyoming law,” the governor’s office said. 
This is the second time Gordon has been tasked with investigating Hadlock over her actions in the 2024 election. In December, Love and seven other voters asked Gordon to begin the process of removing Hadlock from office, alleging acts of misconduct and malfeasance. 
In May, however, the governor decided that “Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation,” Gordon wrote in his decision. “I do not believe there is a clear path to proving guilt.”

The process, as laid out in state statute, will now require Gordon to once more determine whether to recommend that the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court. State law does not allow the governor to unilaterally remove Hadlock from office. 
“Given the very serious nature of the potential consequences, which is the removal of an official duly elected by the voters of Weston County, preserving the objectivity and integrity of this process is crucial,” Gordon’s office said in a statement. “Consequently, the Governor will have no comment on this investigation while it is ongoing, focusing instead on reviewing and determining relevant facts.”
When Gordon will come to a decision is unclear, but his general counsel, Betsy Anderson, told the Management Audit Committee on Tuesday that she personally hoped the inquiry would be completed by the end of the year.
Tuesday meeting
In July, the Management Audit Committee formed a subcommittee to compel testimony from Hadlock and to produce a report on Weston County’s 2024 general election. 
That report was presented to the committee Tuesday. 
“When I brought this forward, I had some objectives as an oversight committee, and that was to find out exactly what happened during that election and see if there was some way of preventing that from happening in the future,” Gillette Republican Rep. Chris Knapp said at the meeting. 
What stood out to many committee members was a post-election audit Hadlock submitted to the secretary of state’s office that included false information. 
County clerks are required by law to perform a post-election audit designed to measure election accuracy using a statistical model. The Wyoming State Canvassing Board uses the audit to decide whether to certify results. 
Hadlock, however, submitted an initial post-election audit showing no errors despite the discrepancy in the results in Neiman’s race as well as a county commissioner race. 
That, taken with other findings the subcommittee was able to review, Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams said, “it certainly suggests that an attempt was made by Clerk Hadlock to cover up the errors that were made with the false post-election audit.”
“That’s my own personal conclusion,” she told the committee. 
Casper Republican Rep. Jayme Lien said she still had “a lot of questions when it comes to Clerk Hadlock,” mostly because she didn’t get the opportunity to ask her questions when Hadlock failed to appear last month. Hadlock had indicated that she had a scheduling conflict, though subpoenas are not optional.
“So I would ask [the Legislative Service Office,] what would a time frame  to make a motion to have her come before us via court order? Do we have the opportunity to do that prior to session starting?” Lien asked 
LSO Senior Legislative Attorney Josh Anderson said he wasn’t sure.
“From my knowledge, I don’t think this has ever occurred before,” Anderson said. “So again, I don’t know exactly what it would look like.”
The committee also voted to sponsor four pieces of legislation inspired by the ongoing situation, including one bill to stiffen the penalties for violating a legislative subpoena. Another bill would specify that it’s a felony to submit a false post-election ballot audit.

At a time when violence is once again testing our democracy, we must recommit to kindness and understanding, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Committing to nonviolence appeared first on WyoFile .","The Vietnam War solidified my commitment to nonviolence, not only because of the deaths in Southeast Asia but because of the murders and attempted murders of public figures here at home — civil rights activist Medgar Evers and President John F. Kennedy in 1963; Freedom Riders James Chaney, Michael Goodman, and Andrew Schwerner, and Pan-Africanist Muslim minister Malcolm X in 1964; civil rights leader and Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968; and attorney general, senator and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy that same year. 

Opinion

The next decade brought no relief. In 1970, four students were killed and nine were wounded when National Guard troops fired on students protesting the Vietnam War at Kent State University in Ohio. Shortly after that, two students were killed and 12 were wounded by state and city police at Jackson State University in Mississippi. In 1972, Alabama governor and presidential candidate George Wallace was shot and left paralyzed from the waist down.
The 1960s and ’70s tested our democracy, that long-winded and rather lumbering system in which each person is equal before the law. Now, we are being tested again. In July 2024, there was an attempted murder of then presidential candidate and now President Donald Trump. In December of the same year, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian R. Thompson was murdered. In June of this year, Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman were murdered. Earlier the same morning, Minnesota State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette Hoffman, were shot and survived. Most recently, the political activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed.
While our national consensus has for much of American history been tenuous and fiercely contested, we have largely been able to maintain nonviolent democratic institutions that have allowed for the development — albeit in a sometimes grindingly slow way — of a more diverse society able to embrace a wide range of experiences and viewpoints.
I worry that we now face the possible dissolution of our democratic system and the consequent destruction of the kind of society we’ve been building for over 200 years. Still, there are voices from the past that give me hope. Surprisingly, one is that of Gov. Wallace, who for much of his life was a fierce opponent of racial equality. In his 1963 inaugural speech, Wallace said, “segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.” To support those words, he stood in a doorway to block the entrance of the first two black students at the University of Alabama. Wallace’s shooting reflected the deep political and cultural polarization of the country. Surprisingly, when Wallace was in the hospital, one of his visitors was Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman elected to Congress. Wallace and Chisholm were both 1972 presidential candidates, and the two could not have been more different. But Chisholm, who sought to bring the country together in the face of poverty, racism and the Vietnam War, visited Wallace. I don’t know what they talked about or what drove Wallace’s thinking, but by the late ’70s, he disavowed his former racist actions, saying, “I was wrong. Those days are over, and they ought to be over.”
That brings me to Robert F. Kennedy. Two months before his assassination, Kennedy was in Indianapolis as part of his 1968 presidential campaign. He was about to speak before a largely Black audience when he learned of Martin Luther King Jr.’s murder. Abandoning his prepared remarks, he spoke spontaneously, informing the audience of King’s death and saying, “Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and to justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that effort.” Kennedy then added, “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be Black.” Following King’s murder, there were riots in cities across the country, but not in Indianapolis where Kennedy spoke.
I hope we keep Wallace’s change of heart, Chisholm’s visit and Kennedy’s words in mind during this time of great social polarization. We can find our way forward by acting from wisdom and compassion, by offering one another kindness and understanding, by stepping out of ourselves and into the other.

Robyn Vining and Sen. Dianne Hesselbein watch. (Photo courtesy of Vining's office) Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Rep. Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa) brought in a big name — award-winning actress Halle Berry — this week to help them call for better education on perimenopause and menopause. 
Berry, who wasn’t able to be at the hearing in real time, has become an advocate nationally for raising awareness of menopause and advocating for changes. She joined the Wisconsin bill authors at a virtual press conference on Tuesday afternoon, and her testimony was played at a Senate Health Committee public hearing Wednesday. The committee also took testimony Wednesday on bills to help with falls prevention among older Wisconsinites and on medical marijuana. 
“This is not a political issue — I promise you, it’s not. It is a human rights issue,” Berry said. 
Menopause is the period of time usually in middle age when a woman has not had her period for 12 consecutive months. Perimenopause is the period of time when hormone levels fluctuate and decline and a woman begins transitioning into menopause. It typically lasts between 4 years and 10 or more years.
Women can reach menopause at different ages, but often women reach it between 45 and 55. Symptoms typically begin during perimenopause. 
During the hearing, Vining listed part of a long list of symptoms that women can experience when they hit perimenopause and menopause.
“Wisconsin women deserve to know what is happening to their bodies. Wisconsin women deserve to access to information that can help explain symptoms like increased anxiety and depression, brain fog, frozen shoulder, concerns about increases in cholesterol, decreases in bone density, sleeplessness, night sweats, increased sensitivity and pain in joints, vertigo, gut issues, loss of libido, the unusual exhaustion, confusing dryness, hot flashes, and more,” Vining said. “Many women say, ‘I don’t feel like myself’ and they deserve to know why that is and what they can do about it.”
Berry said her experience started with “excruciating” pain in her vagina and her OB-GYN telling her that it was herpes “and probably one of the worst cases” he had seen. 
“I had just started dating a new guy, one year into a wonderful new relationship, and [my doctor] said, ‘Well, go have a talk with this guy [because] you have herpes.’”
Berry said she and her partner both got tested and found that neither of them had herpes. She said that when she went back to her doctor, he said that he didn’t know what was wrong with her. She saw another doctor, when she started experiencing dry mouth, who suggested she might have had an autoimmune disorder. She saw the first doctor again when she started experiencing dry eyes. 
It was then that he reluctantly told her she was experiencing menopause. 
“Why couldn’t you just say that to me? You’re my health care provider. You’re my doctor,” Berry said she asked her OB-GYN. “He said, ‘because my patients don’t want to hear they’re in menopause. It scares them. They think they’re getting old.’” 
“I have real life examples of how more education would have saved me almost four years of self-exploration and self-diagnoses,” Berry said.  “I would have loved to have gotten this information from my health care providers.”
Lack of education about menopause is connected to stigma, she said.
Hesselbein and Vining are lead authors on a bill meant to help women in Wisconsin get the information that they need. 
SB 356 would require the Department of Health Services to partner with health care providers, including obstetricians and gynecologists, community health centers and hospitals, to educate women on symptoms and other issues surrounding perimenopause and menopause. The bill is bipartisan with Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevera (R-Appleton) as a cosponsor. 
Under the bill, DHS would also be required to create digital and physical informational materials to be distributed to women who are or are soon to experience perimenopause and menopause. 
The authors said it was discussions with their friends and shared experiences that led them to introduce the bill. 
“We’re all talking about the same thing right now,” Hesselbein said. “[Halle Berry is] having this problem with all the resources she has, and as a state employee with my health insurance, I also ran into some obstacles where people weren’t giving me the correct information. …How many other women in the state of Wisconsin are going through this?” 
Hesselbein said a big moment for her was when she was dealing with “frozen shoulder” — a condition that causes pain, stiffness and limited range of motion in the shoulder joint and is common during perimenopause. 
“I didn’t know what it was, and I thought it’s not related to menopause,” Hesselbein said. “They gave me a cortisone shot, which was really great because it released the frozen shoulder, and I had [physical therapy] after that… I talked to friends about it, they’re like, ‘oh, yeah, I’ve had that too.’”
Hesselbein said the bill is based on a similar model adopted in Pennsylvania. 
“It is my hope that we can pass this bill so that we can get Wisconsin women the help they deserve and in the process of doing so that we can destigmatize honest and forthright conversations and discussions about menopause and perimenopause,” Vining said.
Falls prevention awareness
Rep. Rick Gundrum (R-Slinger) and Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) are seeking to cut down on the number of falls that Wisconsin residents are experiencing through a state grant to raise awareness for prevention. 
“If passed, the impact that this bill would have on Wisconsin’s older population is significant,” Gundrum said during the public hearing. “Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death and hospitalization for seniors. According to the CDC, Wisconsin has the highest fall death rate among older adults in the country.”
According to a recent Department of Health Services report, emergency medical services responded to 35,564 more falls-related calls in 2024 when compared to 2019 — an increase of nearly 10,000 a year or 7.4% a year since 2019. 
Speculation on why the state’s high fall death rate includes Wisconsin’s cold weather, the amount of alcohol that is consumed in the state and that the state may be better at reporting death-related falls.
SB 410 would provide $900,000 across 2025-26 and 2026-27 to the Wisconsin Institute for Healthy Aging, a nonprofit that oversees the Falls Free Wisconsin Coalition. The coalition is responsible for a statewide initiative to reduce older adult falls and works to raise awareness; curate and share best practices in falls prevention; gather and report falls data; and address policy and systems changes. The state funds provided under the bill would be used by the organization to support falls prevention awareness and initiatives. 
A legislative council staffer told lawmakers in response to a question that the bill in its current form is  “really a broad charge to the Institute for Healthy Aging for how they’d want to spend the money in the category of falls.” 
“I think it would kind of remain to be seen exactly how, what initiatives they’ve spent the money on,” the staffer said. “The bill gives the Institute broad latitude to figure out how to use the money.” 
Jill Renken, executive director of the Wisconsin Institute for Healthy Aging, told the committee that she has seen the benefits of programs through her own mother, who had started falling in her home after she retired. She said that she encouraged her mother to take a class at the local aging and disability resource center, which she said can reduce falls by 31%. 
“I noticed that she was applying what she learned… She was doing her exercises. She talked with her pharmacist about her medications. My dad made some home safety modifications in the home,” Renken said. “I’m so excited that she has not fallen. It’s been over two years.” 
Renken said the organization for the last decade has worked to diversify funding, but there isn’t enough to sustain their activity.
“State investment is critical in order to maintain the stability of the programs, to maintain the services that we offer and also to grow the program so we can make a much more significant impact in our communities,” Renken said. “We want more older adults to be able to have access to these programs and services. We want to increase awareness so that people know what these services exist.”

Torrey Harris of Memphis says legislation to created recall measure for local officials returns accountability to ""the people."" (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) Amid an argument over jettisoning Memphis school board members, state Rep. Torrey Harris is sponsoring a measure that would allow voters to recall local elected leaders.
House Bill 1448, which Harris filed Tuesday, would create a process for the removal of officials such as mayors, county commissioners, school board members and other county officials. 
Some Tennessee local government charters already allow recall votes, or an ouster lawsuit can be filed in chancery court for misconduct or neglect of duty. But Harris’ measure would be based largely on voter discontent with an official. 
“This legislation is about restoring the power of accountability where it belongs — with the people,” Harris said in a statement. “Our communities deserve to have confidence that if their elected leaders stop representing their values or fail to uphold the public trust, there is a process in place to act responsibly and democratically.”
Harris passed legislation earlier this year to move the election dates of school board members to match those of county commissions. It passed the legislature overwhelmingly despite opposition from Senate Democrats and a handful of House Democrats. 
Sen. London Lamar, a Memphis Democrat, said Wednesday she could not support the bill because of the need to protect the rights of voters to select representatives rather than tinkering with the process.
“We already have a system for holding elected officials accountable. It’s called an election. Creating a new recall process risks turning local democracy into a series of vengeance campaigns by sore losers or politically motivated special interests,” Lamar said in a statement to the Lookout.
Lamar said she believes such legislation also could “open the door” for more out-of-state dark money to target “community leaders.”
After the session vote, Shelby County Commission voted 7-5 this summer to change the date of school board elections to match other 2026 elections, a move that would shorten the four-year terms of five members. Commissioners initially delayed action because of school board opposition and questions about the constitutionality of reducing terms, Chalkbeat Tennessee reported.










We already have a system for holding elected officials accountable. It’s called an election. Creating a new recall process risks turning local democracy into a series of vengeance campaigns by sore losers or politically motivated special interests.


– Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis


Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who is not related to Torrey Harris,  vetoed the measure because he opposed changing the terms of sitting board members. It hasn’t been brought back for an override vote.
Those moves are believed to be targeting four Memphis Shelby County School Board members in mid-term after they voted to fire Superintendent Marie Feagins this year, upsetting some community members and leading to a lawsuit by the former schools leader.
Memphis Democratic Rep. G.A. Hardaway, who voted for Harris’ initial bill this year, asked for a legal opinion in August from Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti to determine whether it is constitutional for county officials to shorten school board member terms, according to the Chalkbeat Tennessee report. The opinion hasn’t been filed yet.
Rep. Harris’ new legislation is expected to be sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Brent Taylor, a Shelby County Republican who tried to orchestrate a state takeover of the school district this year. He was unable to muster enough support to gain passage, especially in light of the failure of the state’s Achievement School District to make a major difference in Memphis’ troubled schools. The state-run district that created several charter schools in Memphis is being phased out.
Harris’ bill, which also would affect mayors, sheriffs, trustees, clerks, property assessors and registers of deeds, would allow local voters to file a petition with the county election commission demanding a recall. It would have to be signed by 66% of the total vote cast for the office in the last regular election and give a general statement on the grounds for removal.
When submitted, the petition would have to include a sworn affidavit stating each voter’s signature is genuine and received within 90 days of the start of the petition. In addition, the person circulating the petition must have voted in favor of the official they’re seeking to remove in that elected official’s last regular election.
If the county election commission places the matter on a ballot, it must be posed only to voters represented by the official up for removal.

(Getty Images)More than 1,000 West Virginians with disabilities — mostly children — are on a waitlist for help and services as the state doesn’t have the capacity to serve them right now. 
The state’s Intellectual and/or Developmental Disability Waiver program had only 139 slots earlier this year, according to the Department of Human Services. The program provides funding to help teach and support people with disabilities and helps eligible adults live with assistance in community settings rather than institutions. 
The IDD waitlist was 1,031 people as of Oct. 7.
“Seven-hundred-and-eighty-nine individuals who are on the waitlist are under the age of 18,” said DoHS spokesperson Angelica Hightower.
Medicaid-eligible children 3 and older with a diagnosed disability can receive speech therapy, crisis services and more. It can help children avoid living in a facility.
Del. Evan Worrell
“I have major concerns that most of these are children. We do not have the proper level or amount of care in this state to provide services to that many children, but keeping them on a waitlist when they need help is very concerning,” said House Health Chair Evan Worrell, R-Cabell.
The program also provides respite care for parents and caregivers.
“I know one family in Wayne County, she’s not had a respite worker in three years,” said Brad Story, CEO of the West Virginia Behavioral Healthcare Providers Association. “It’s concerning.”
Brad Story
DoHS didn’t provide an answer when asked about what was being done to address the waitlist issue.
Worrell said lawmakers may have to step in and force DoHS to use the allocated IDD waiver funds strictly on people with disabilities. Lawmakers could amend budget legislation that mandates how DoHS spends the money.
“There was testimony last year that for over five years, Medicaid had not spent the allocated [IDD waiver] funds on that program,” Worrell said. “They transferred the funds to other areas of their agency to use for other items. That should not be allowed.”
“I will look to force directive language in the budget bill to make this happen,” he continued.
Justice touted clearing IDD waitlist, but problem persists 
Clearing the IDD waitlist became a political point for previous Gov. Jim Justice, who ordered DoHS to clear the list in 2019, saying it was nonnegotiable as more than 1,000 people with disabilities needed services. 
During his U.S. Senate campaign last year, he pledged to clear the list again and announced a pay increase to hire and retain staff working the IDD population in their homes or community settings. 
But the problem persisted.

The ongoing workforce shortage has contributed to the current IDD waitlist, according to Story.
“You’ve got to have workers,” he said. “Those families really need services … I just hope you know when they do get their [IDD waiver] slots — whenever that is — that they have the workforce available.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey recently announced a Medicaid rate increase that is intended to improve pay for this workforce. West Virginia uses state and federal money from Medicaid to reimburse private companies that employ direct care workers. These workers make around $13 to $15 an hour.
“I’m so thankful the governor raised these rates to not only stop the loss of these important services, but maybe for others to open up these services,” Worrell said. “It is a great start, but now we need to ensure those funds the Legislature allocates are being spent on the IDD community only.”
Story praised Morrisey’s rate increase but said a bigger pay bump was needed to increase direct care staff who work with people with disabilities.
“In order to be competitive with big market companies like Starbucks and Sheetz, we need to be able to pay our employees about $17 an hour, in order to keep them and grow the company,” he said. 
In 2024, DoHS said the cost to remove 50 members from the waitlist was $3.9 million per year.
Hightower said once eligibility is determined for a child or adult, the applicant is placed on a waitlist until a slot becomes available. 
“While on the managed enrollment list, applicants may receive services such as therapies and targeted case management through Medicaid until a slot becomes available,” she said. 
She said federal funding cuts under President Donald Trump haven’t impacted the waitlist.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Department of Correctional Services)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Governor’s Office said a 17-day delay in publicizing a state-federal contract to convert a Nebraska prison into an immigration detention center was needed to conduct a legal review first of what information, if any, should be withheld.
Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, signed the 183-page contract with attachments with an unnamed official in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding use of the Work Ethic Camp in McCook on Sept. 30. However, the contract was not made publicly available until Oct. 17, when Gov. Jim Pillen’s office publicized the partnership.
In a Wednesday email responding to questions from Oct. 17, Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple detailed the reasons for the legal review: What contract portions should legally be redacted under state and federal public information laws, “including laws protecting the integrity of the negotiation process and ensuring operational safety.”
Asked if the state had any other similar contracts with the federal government that have not yet been released, Strimple said, “There are no other related records which remain under legal review.”
‘Well-established exceptions’
Under the initial two-year contract, ICE plans to pay Nebraska at least $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees, adult men and women, at the repurposed Work Ethic Camp. The monthly reimbursement rate would increase by 3% in the second year.
Pillen’s office has said the contract would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. ICE will also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.”
All inmates previously housed at the Work Ethic Camp were moved to other Corrections facilities by early this month. The state has not yet answered where they were moved or whether some were paroled or finished sentences.

Craig Strong, left, and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys as the state announces it will work with ICE at the state prison in McCook. Aug 19. 2025.

Strimple said among state exemptions used to withhold records were ones shielding information about the protection of public property security and persons on or within such property and personal information of personnel. Also used was a state exemption to shield certain information if its release could jeopardize promised federal funds, services or other “essential information.”
Exemptions under the federal Freedom of Information Act were also used, though Strimple did not specify which. Nine congressional exemptions shield information that could be “harmful to a governmental or private interest.”
“The Office of the Governor has released all public information while also considering well-established exceptions,” Strimple said.
Under state law, public records exemptions allow — but do not require — certain information to be withheld.
Among the information redacted in the released contract:

Minimum staffing requirements.
Certain pay details for on-call guard services.
Government use of wireless communication devices.
Names and contact information of some federal officials.
Some examples of serious incidents that must be reported.
What to do in emergency situations when receiving or discharging detainees.
Allowable videotaping at the ICE facility (no videotaping without ICE permission).

‘New questions and concerns’
ACLU of Nebraska had negotiated with Pillen’s office and attorney Jennifer Huxoll, chief of the Civil Litigation Bureau, and had agreed that the state would release a “substantive response” on the Nebraska-ICE contract provisions by noon Oct. 17. That day, Pillen’s office sent out a news release disclosing the contract at 12:13 p.m. 
The governor first announced that Nebraska would work with ICE to house federal migrant detainees on Aug. 19.

Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director for ACLU Nebraska, said last week that Pillen’s contract negotiations put Nebraska in “uncharted territory” in converting a state prison “into an arm of a massive detention and deportation campaign.”
“It speaks volumes that Nebraskans are only just now getting hard facts about this agreement, weeks after it has been signed,” Houlden said in a statement. “It is troubling that what we have now seen raises new questions and concerns about oversight, liability and the state’s authority to even open this facility.” 
The Governor’s Office had denied at least nine records requests, including from the Nebraska Examiner, seeking more information on the Nebraska-ICE partnership by late September. Talks between Nebraska and federal officials had been happening since at least March, according to records separately obtained by Common Cause Nebraska, a government watchdog group.
The Examiner’s request also sought information on communications between Pillen, his staff and Homeland Security officials about Nebraska housing federal immigration detainees. While the Governor’s Office said records exist, it denied records on the grounds that such records were:

“Proprietary or commercial information.”
“Negotiation records for the lease or sale of an interest in real property.”
“Confidential communications.”
Shielded under attorney-client privilege.

Lawsuit continues
A lawsuit from 13 McCook residents and a former state lawmaker, filed last week in Red Willow County District Court, seeks to reverse the Nebraska-ICE partnership. It argues the joint effort and contract violates state laws and separation of powers in the Nebraska Constitution without legislative approval.

In a court filing this week seeking to dismiss the case, the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, on behalf of Pillen and Jeffreys, defended the contract, writing: “Nebraska statutes do not hamstring the department from adapting its facilities to address ever-changing circumstances.”
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng rejected a temporary restraining order to pause state-federal action Oct. 16, before it was clear a contract with ICE had been signed. Heng will consider a temporary injunction at a hearing this Friday. It would allow the lawsuit to continue and block Nebraska from accepting detainees.
“Homeland Security is doing walk-throughs this week,” Pillen said Monday on his monthly radio call-in show. “We would expect … folks would begin being incarcerated there in the next week.”

Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health on Wednesday. “It affects people from all walks of life.

Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) during a hearing of the Senate Committee on Health on Wednesday. “It affects people from all walks of life. There is no doubt that each and every one of us knows someone that has suffered through an illness and struggles to find ways to make it through each day.” 
Testin was speaking in favor of SB 534, a bill introduced by Republicans to legalize medical cannabis in Wisconsin. If passed, the bill would allow registered patients to have cannabis in a non-smokeable form such as a concentrate, oil, tincture, edible, pill, cream or vapor. The bill would also create an Office of Medical Cannabis Regulation attached to the state health department and tasked with overseeing the budding program. 
Testin shared a story about his grandfather, whom he described as his role model and as “the reason I decided to take a life of public service.” Back in the 1990s, Testin’s grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer, which then metastasized to bone cancer. 
The senator recalled watching his grandfather undergo chemotherapy. The man “was a big guy,” Testin said, “and we watched him wither away.” At that moment, over 25 years ago, “my family made the very difficult decision to go outside the law to get him marijuana,” Testin said. “It gave him his appetite back, and it gave him time that we probably otherwise would not have had.”

Testin said his story was not unique. Although other medications exist, he said that many “come with side effects that can make living a normal life much more difficult.” He noted that 40 states, including Wisconsin’s neighbors Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota, give patients access to medical cannabis when recommended by doctors. Texas is the most recent state to legalize medical cannabis, he noted
“So both red and blue states alike have been able to come together and recognize that this is a viable option,” Testin said. “Medicine is never a one size fits all, and it’s time for Wisconsin to join the majority of the country and add another option which may help patients find relief they need.”
Legislation’s provisions
Under the proposed bill, medical cannabis sales would be tracked through the state’s prescription drug monitoring program. Pharmacists would also be required to be on-site at dispensaries. The legislation would only cover certain conditions: cancer, seizures or epilepsy, glaucoma, severe chronic pain, severe muscle spasms, severe chronic nausea, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and any terminal illness, including patients with a life expectancy of less than a year. 
Patients must be at least 18 years old. Minors could have access if there is  written consent “from all” of their parents or guardians. Patients would be given registration cards and would be charged $20 a year to remain on the registry. 
The bill also prohibits dispensaries or their staff “from claiming that medical cannabis may cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent any disease or medical condition.” Dispensaries would also be prohibited from “advertising their services to the general public, with certain exceptions.”

The bill includes a provision preventing courts from considering  lawful use or possession of cannabis, or being registered as a patient, when determining  custody or placement of a child, except where the child has access to the cannabis. Unlawful possession or use could still be used against parents in court, however. The bill also protects people who lawfully possess cannabis against housing discrimination, and prevents local governments from regulating legal medical cannabis programs or using zoning laws to restrict the location or operation of a legal cannabis operation. 
Support and opposition
Earlier this year, two-thirds of registered voters polled by Marquette Law School said that cannabis should be legalized in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Wellness Coalition has registered with the Wisconsin Ethics Commission in support of the legislation and the Wisconsin Medical Society against it, The Alzheimer’s Association, Outdoor Advertising Association, and Pharmacy Society have all registered their positions as “other.” 
People from a variety of backgrounds also spoke during the public hearing. Many supported legalizing cannabis, but had concerns about restrictions in the bill. 
“This should not be a partisan issue,” said Testin. “It is clear that we as a state need to begin having a real discussion about medical cannabis legalization, and it is our hope that this bill will be the first step. It’s time for Wisconsin to provide our citizens with another option in their health care.” 
Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk), who has proposed  medical cannabis legislation for years, echoed that sentiment. 
“Wisconsin is on an island surrounded by neighboring states that allow the use of medical cannabis products,” Felzkowski said during the Wednesday hearing. “Someone who suffers from a serious health condition should not have to make the choice to travel to another state or break the law so that they can try an alternative medicine for relief.”

Felzkowski recounted her battles with breast cancer, first when she was 40 years old, which resulted in a double mastectomy, and then a stage 4 diagnosis a decade later. She described the side effects of opioids that doctors prescribed to control her pain as “something nobody should have to live through.” 
She said her oncologist called medical cannabis  “another tool in the toolbox, and it could help a lot of people.” 
 “Here we are sitting in our Ivory Tower, denying that for people that really need it, and it’s wrong that we’re doing that,” Felzkowski said.
Legislators are divided
Lawmakers hope to get more colleagues behind the bill. Yet, despite lagging behind many other states, Wisconsin’s Legislature still struggles with just talking about cannabis. “We are not going to be talking about overall legalization for cannabis products,” said Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevera (R-Appleton), as she chaired a meeting of the Senate Committee on Health on Wednesday. “So, if you’re here to testify on how this should be 100% legal, this is not the spot for you today.” 
The Legislature held its first public hearing on legalizing cannabis in 2022 in the Senate. Rep. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston), who also spoke during Wednesday’s hearing, said in an interview with the Wisconsin Examiner that he’s optimistic that the new bill will survive the Senate. “My goal this time,” Snyder told Wisconsin Examiner, “is something we haven’t done yet since I’ve been here and that is to have a hearing in the Assembly, where people I talk to can come down and explain their situations.”
Snyder said he hears from constituents who want the state to legalize medical cannabis. When he talks to Republicans who oppose the bill, he said, “I try to tell them first of all, this is something that helps a person. This is something that is going to be focused on folks that really need it.” 
Snyder stressed that “these are people not looking for shortcuts to get marijuana, I mean they could do that without [legalized medical cannabis].” Rather, his constituents are people who often don’t want to travel so far north or south to get their medicine, or who would prefer going to a local farmer or dispensary instead.
Rep. Patrick Snyder
The bill’s critics include Republicans who feel medical cannabis would only lead to legalizing recreational use, which they don’t want, as well as Democrats who criticize the bill’s restrictive framework and want Wisconsin to legalize recreational use of cannabis. 
Even with the Republican bill’s restrictions on the form in which cannabis can be used and its system of rigorous licensing, testing and enforcement, Snyder said there are “far right” Republicans in the Assembly who need to be won over. 
Felzkowski said of the 24 states that allow recreational marijuana, 15 did so through ballot measures, which aren’t available in Wisconsin. “So that’s never going to happen in the state,” she said. 
Nine states that have legalized recreational  marijuana after legalizing medical cannabis “are solid blue states like Illinois, New York, and Connecticut,” she said. “Wisconsin is not a solid blue state.”  
Another 16 states have only legalized medical cannabis. Hawaii, the first state to pass a comprehensive medical cannabis program in 2000, still does not allow recreational cannabis, she said.  
“Fortunately, Wisconsin is able to learn from the experience of other states,” said Felzkowski. “We can create an effective program with safeguards, so patients and small businesses can benefit from medical cannabis products, while preventing abuse, or those without medical need from gaining access.”



GOP legislation would heighten hemp regulation to curb THC
As some Republicans work to legalize medical cannabis, others are focused on regulating or implementing new prohibitions on other hemp and cannabis products in Wisconsin. 
Representatives Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls), Jim Piwowarczyk (R-Hubertus), Chuck Wichgers, (R-Muskego), Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield), and Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield), have all signed onto what Brill’s office called in a press release “a common-sense corrective bill” to  close a “loophole” in the state’s hemp laws that “allows dangerous, psychoactive THC-laced products to proliferate in Wisconsin.” 
The bill focuses on regulating or eliminating products containing delta-8 THC, delta-10 THC, HHC, and other natural or synthetic cannabinoid derivatives. 
“This proliferation is an active threat to public health,” Brill’s press release stated, referring to emergency room visits, poison control calls and hospitalizations of children after ingesting delta-8 THC and “other similar substances.”
“Both the CDC and FDA have issued warnings about the dangers of these products, which remain legal and dangerously unregulated,” the press release stated.
One 2024 study analyzing national poison data systems found that between 2021 and 2022 reports of exposure to delta-8 THC increased by 79%. The study also found that poison center calls related to delta-THC were “significantly lower” in places where either delta-THC was banned, or where cannabis use was legal. “Consistent regulation of delta-THC across all states should be adopted,” the study concluded.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Medical-Marijuana-products_-Drew-Angerer-Getty-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-23 06:17:23.591167

(Photo by Rachel Nederveld/The Current)Elizabeth English has always been interested in water. As a child on a farm in New Jersey, one of her favorite games was to turn on the hose and make dams and diversions as the water ran down her driveway. With a background in architecture and structural engineering, Elizabeth came to Louisiana to teach at Tulane’s architecture school, before ending up at the LSU Hurricane Center.
Two years after that move, Hurricane Katrina hit. The more time English spent documenting Katrina’s damage, the more determined she became to find a solution for homes to survive future storms.
“I thought, here I am, a background in architecture and engineering, and working at the LSU Hurricane Center. If I can’t come up with a better idea, then who can?” says English. “I came to the Hurricane Center as a wind researcher and I left the Hurricane Center as a flood researcher.”
She noticed many raised homes floated up with Katrina’s flood waters and remained structurally sound after the water receded, dropping them back onto their foundations. It presented a way to adapt homes to floods, without losing the essential venue for front-porch culture, a drawback of elevating homes above street level in places like New Orleans.
“I realized that this floating behavior, if it could be developed in a purposeful way as a temporary elevation, then you didn’t have to permanently elevate the houses,” she says. “They would be safe if they could float on the water for the period of time that the flood was there and then come back down on its regular foundation just like it was.”
She began working on this idea in early 2006 and soon learned homes were already floating just an hour north of her.

Old River Landing is a camp community north of Morganza, and because it is between the Mississippi River and the levee system, it floods annually. Historically, the camps were either stilted or moved to the other side of the levee during the floods. Then, in the 1980s, resident Buddy Blalock designed his house based on a floating camp nearby, the same concept English had in mind over twenty years later. Since then, as many as 40 structures, including the local restaurant, have successfully navigated annual floods by rising with the water.
In 2011, Old River Landing had a record flood, and those amphibious structures, as this style of architecture is called, proved to be a very effective way to survive storms. The homes raised to the FEMA-recommended height flooded. The amphibious ones did not.
“I have some photographs of a very badly damaged elevated house next door to an amphibious camp that went up and came back down and had no damage whatsoever,” she told me.
But English faced some hurdles developing her work in the area. Because FEMA focuses on moving people away from vulnerable areas, they discourage people from building adaptive homes by withholding insurance from homes that are able to float.
Complicating matters more, if a municipality were to issue a building permit for a new amphibious structure, it could lose its good standing with the National Flood Insurance Program, affecting insurance eligibility across the municipality. In 2014, FEMA began allowing homes to be retrofitted with some restrictions, but by then English was teaching in Canada, where she had more latitude to pursue her research.
English has since built and consulted on amphibious structures internationally. “There’s much more activity on amphibious construction in Europe,” she explains. “There are people in other parts of the world who are actively working on developing this, but as far as I know, I’m the only person in North America.” In fact, she may be the only person in the world who focuses on retrofitting old homes to be amphibious.
English’s dream has always been to focus on lower income homes in South Louisiana, which she fell in love with during her tenure at LSU.
As a professor emerita at the University of Waterloo in Canada, English can spend more time back home in Breaux Bridge, where she has kept a residence all these years.
Now that some FEMA hurdles have been cleared, she is working to secure grants for a prototype amphibious retrofit in Louisiana through her organization Buoyant Foundation Project.
“We need to learn to work with nature instead of trying to fight with the environment. Let water do what it wants to do,” she says. “We need to learn to accommodate water instead of trying to control water and make it accommodate us.”

(Photo by Madelyn Murphy/Colorado Newsline)Colorado-based airline Key Lime Air is running flights of detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to government data, flight tracking and analysis by Colorado Newsline.
Personnel in reflective vests led 11 people in shackles off a plane registered to Key Lime at King County International Airport outside Seattle on Thursday, Oct. 9, a little before noon. A short time later, another 38 people in shackles were escorted off a bus, patted down and led onto the plane, which then flew to El Paso, Texas. White trash bags that appeared to contain their personal belongings sat on the tarmac.
Cameron Satterfield, a spokesperson for the airport, confirmed that the flight was operated for ICE by Key Lime.
A Newsline reporter observed the Key Lime plane through a county-run livestream of the tarmac. Advocates say such flights that shuffle people across the country can be damaging for mental health, family connection and legal access.
“Transfers are inefficient, chaotic and can feel punitive, particularly when people are spirited away from their community, family and lawyers to an unfamiliar place where they have no ties,” said Laura Lunn, director of advocacy and litigation for the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network.

A similar scene with another plane full of shackled passengers played out in Alexandria, Louisiana, on Oct. 11, observed by a reporter at the airport. Newsline has also traced that plane to Key Lime, based on online databases. The two planes appear to have performed similar immigration-related operations every day for more than a month.
The company is the first known Colorado-based airline to participate in immigration enforcement flights since the Trump administration launched mass deportation efforts earlier this year.
The aircraft do not bear Key Lime logos or other company designators, but they display unique registration numbers.
Contacted by a reporter and asked to confirm that two planes bearing the registration numbers Newsline tied to Key Lime are involved in immigration operations, CEO Cliff Honeycutt referred questions to CSI Aviation and declined to disclose details about any contracts. CSI is one of the largest federal contractors for ICE flights and has an approximately $563 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The reporter asked if Key Lime operates under a CSI subcontract.
“Yes, but again, we really don’t discuss our customers’ arrangements,” Honeycutt said.
A Federal Aviation Administration spreadsheet for certain commercial aircraft identifies one of the planes — the one observed near Seattle — as being operated by Key Lime.
Ch-aviation, a widely cited aviation information resource, designates both planes as being operated by Key Lime.


In addition to confirmation from Satterfield that one of the planes had transported detainees for ICE, the planes are tied to ICE activity through the flight patterns of the aircraft and other indicators.
The company is part of a growing network of operators participating in immigration enforcement, especially flights between ICE detention centers throughout the country. Human Rights First, a nonprofit that oversees the ICE Flight Monitor project, noted a monthly record of 969 domestic immigration enforcement flights in September, including 83 by Key Lime.
An unnamed ICE spokesperson referred questions to Key Lime, which, aside from the exchange with Honeycutt, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A company representative declined to speak with a Newsline reporter who visited company headquarters.
‘Sense of confusion’
Domestic air transfers of the kind Key Lime is performing create layers of disruption for community members, Lunn said.
“Attorneys are forced to figure out how to reach clients in facilities far from their offices or the courts where they practice. Family members are no longer able to visit their loved ones when they’re simply too far away. All of these breeds a sense of confusion, and the most common assumption people make when they’re being put on a plane is that they are being deported,” Lunn said.
The Trump administration aims to deport millions of immigrants without permanent legal status, and has expanded federal capacity to detain and deport immigrants in record numbers. That includes $170 billion for immigration enforcement efforts, construction on new detention centers and plans to open shuttered prisons for ICE detention, including at least two in Colorado. The White House claims there have been over 400,000 deportations since the start of President Donald Trump’s term in January.

Top ICE detention hubs
In mid-September, the two Key Lime planes suddenly changed their routes and began flying to and from major immigration detention hubs, primarily in the South, according to flight data from ADS-B Exchange, an online flight tracking database.
A Newsline analysis shows the two planes frequent ICE detention hubs, including El Paso, Texas; Harlingen, Texas; and Alexandria, Louisiana. Those three cities are the sites of by far the most transfer and deportation flights in the country, according to The New York Times. Alexandria is often the last stop before someone is sent on a flight out of the country.
Between Sept. 15, when the planes changed their flight patterns, and Oct.17, at least one of the planes stopped in Alexandria at least once a day, Newsline analysis showed. Most days both planes traveled to or from the city at least once, according to flight data. For example, one of the planes on Oct. 7 flew from Alexandria to Nashville, back to Alexandria, and then on to Tampa. It ended the night back in Alexandria.
During the time period Newsline analyzed, the Key Lime planes were in Alexandria 59 times, Harlingen 11 times, El Paso 14 times and Lake City — a 15-minute drive from the Everglades detention center Republicans branded “Alligator Alcatraz” — nine times.
ICE flights obscured
Information about ICE flights is often obscured, and the flights can be hard to identify and track. Federal authorities release scant information, and ICE does not publish schedules or logs of agency flights. Carriers can block certain registration numbers from public flight tracking websites under the Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed program, and it appears the registration numbers of both Key Lime planes were blocked from the popular flight tracking website FlightAware.
But seasoned flight trackers have highlighted Key Lime’s work for ICE for weeks. It was first identified in a post on BlueSky by a user who goes by JJ in DC, a military veteran with experience tracking flights. Planes carrying detained immigrants for ICE are increasingly likely to use atypical call signs, identifiers used during flight communication. The two Key Lime planes flew under its call sign “LYM” until mid-September, then suddenly switched to “TYS” or “TYSON.” Advocates say that is a key tell of an ICE flight that they first noticed with various airlines in late March. It is the same call sign that was used for Trump’s personal plane after he was first elected in 2016 and for other high-profile presidential candidates protected by the Secret Service.
“We just saw this big shift and we’ve noticed that a big part of ICE contractors are now using these faux call signs to obscure their activity,” Guadalupe Gonzalez, a flight monitoring coordinator for Washington-based La Resistencia, said. “I haven’t seen a flight under TYSON that hasn’t been operating under ICE.”
Key Lime is based at Centennial Airport in Englewood and also offers passenger charter flights and scheduled commercial flights through its subsidiary Denver Air Connection.
The two planes in question are Embraer commuter jets that can hold about 50 passengers, according to multiple online databases.
The planes are owned by an Oregon company, CBG LLC. It is common for an aircraft’s owner and operator to be different entities. Key Lime regularly operates CBG planes. Key Lime’s 2009 application to the U.S. Department of Transportation for commuter air carrier authorization indicates the three owners of Key Lime were also the three owners of CBG.
Key Lime is the only Colorado company known to be operating ICE flights, according to advocates. New Mexico-based CSI Aviation subcontracts to other airlines including Avelo, Global Exchange and Eastern Air Express.

(by Marc Perrusquia)This story was originally published by The Institute for Public Service Reporting Memphis. 
Mayor Paul Young confirmed late Monday in a contentious town hall meeting with Hispanic residents that the Memphis Police Department is cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
His statements before a crowd of hundreds in East Memphis came as a remarkable development considering that city leaders for years had denied any collaboration between the police force and ICE.
Young said his aim in allowing the cooperation was to steer federal agents away from mass deportation and toward helping MPD investigate murders and other violent crimes.
If he fought the administration of President Donald Trump, as officials in Chicago are doing, the federal government would respond with even harsher tactics, he said.
“I believe that the posture of Chicago has caused the federal government to flood the community with ICE agents focused on immigration,” Young said, drawing occasional applause. “That is why I have chosen to make sure that our police department is working with the federal teams to direct them towards our problem, which is crime.”
But the mayor received sharp pushback from some in the crowd at Mullins United Methodist Church where a big group of mostly Hispanic residents turned out to hear Young speak alongside Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis.
“This morning, they took away a mother. The mother left behind a one-year-old child,” Maria Alejandra Oceja said in Spanish. A key leader of community group Vecindarios901, Oceja said it’s one of many similar cases of parents arrested and children left behind.
At another point, a woman shouted at the mayor from the back of the church. “Should we wait until all of our family members get taken away?”
Some audience members argued that federal agents here are already using racial profiling and other heavy-handed tactics against non-criminal Hispanics.
President Trump and Gov. Bill Lee have sent more than 1,000 federal agents, state troopers, and National Guard members into Memphis since late September in an anti-crime initiative known as the Memphis Safe Task Force. They have made hundreds of arrests, including numerous immigration arrests. Full arrest data is not available.
But Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy, who attended the Monday night meeting, told the Institute for Public Service Reporting that he has been receiving regular reports from the task force.
“I think people expected it to be about crime. And even on immigration — immigrants who are criminals — that’s not what we’re seeing,” Mulroy said.
About 20 percent of the arrests are immigration-related, he said. What proportion of those involve immigrants accused of committing crimes?
“I don’t know precisely, but not many,’’ Mulroy said. “There doesn’t seem to be any indication of reports of criminal activity other than unlawful presence in the United States.”
Entry into the country without inspection can be charged as a crime, yet unlawful presence in the United States is generally treated as a civil immigration offense, not a crime.
For decades, federal immigration enforcement was rare in non-border areas like Memphis. Previous Democratic and Republican administrations had focused on deportations of immigrants who had been arrested or convicted of other crimes in the U.S., such as driving under the influence, drug dealing or murder.
The light federal enforcement in non-border areas meant that most unauthorized immigrants in Memphis managed to live normal lives: working in construction and other industries and frequently buying homes, sending children to school and sometimes launching their own businesses.
Today, the situation has changed dramatically. The Trump administration and Congress are dedicating billions of dollars toward large-scale deportation, regardless of the immigrants’ criminal records.
Seventy-two percent immigrants in detention centers today have no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Access Records Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
Photos raise questions

The community meeting was led by several local Hispanic pastors and Vecinarios901, or V901, an organization that tracks ICE activities in the city and posts real-time updates on Facebook. (The wife of the author of this article volunteers with V901.)
Early in the meeting, with the mayor and police chief sitting on stage just a few feet away, V901 leader Oceja said before the law enforcement surge began, the organization received only three to five reports of federal activity per day.
Since feds and state troopers began operating on September 29, the count has exploded to more than 500 reports per week, Oceja said.
She used a projector and a screen to show the audience what she said were pictures of ICE and MPD working together during the ongoing law enforcement surge.
“In this image, you can see an HSI officer in the passenger seat of an MPD vehicle with an MPD officer,” she said. HSI stands for Homeland Security Investigations. The agency is part of ICE, and President Trump this year shifted its focus from criminal investigations to mass deportations.
“And in the other image, you can see the HSI officer who was trailing these MPD vehicles as well,” Oceja said.
Moments later, Mayor Young addressed the audience, confirming that MPD is working with ICE.
“My strategy has been and continues to be to keep this task force focused on violent crime as opposed to immigration,” Young said.
“What has happened here is we have 13 federal agencies (in the task force) and ICE is one of them. However, their charge is to focus on violent crime, and so the busier we can keep them with MPD, the less time they will have to focus on immigration.”
His confirmation of collaboration came as a departure from statements of past Memphis leaders.
As immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America began arriving in Memphis in the 1990s and as armed robbers began to target them, the police department began a steady public relations campaign to reassure immigrants that they didn’t check people’s immigration status.
Police urged immigrants to report crimes, serve as witnesses and help solve robberies, domestic violence and other crimes involving the Hispanic community.
Young didn’t say precisely when the collaboration between MPD and ICE began. But in response to a question, he said MPD’s cooperation with ICE didn’t involve traffic stops, which have become one of the more controversial tactics used by the task force.
“The traffic stops that you’re seeing are happening with Tennessee Highway Patrol,’’ Young said, emphasizing the federal agents are working with special units within MPD to focus on serious crime. “That’s why we have begun to get this task force ingrained into our Organized Crime Unit, our Multi-Agency Gang Unit. We have to focus on homicides, increasing our clearance rate, so we can solve some of the real violent crimes that are happening in our cities. When they (federal agents) don’t have those things to do, they ride around pulling people over.”
As ICE and Border Patrol vehicles patrol Memphis streets, videos and stories of traffic-stop arrests by masked agents are spreading online. Some immigrants are carrying passports and other documents, fearful of frequent traffic stops and a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that effectively allows racial profiling.
Others are avoiding going to work or shopping altogether, hiding in their homes. Some are running out of food, leaders of an immigrant food pantry have said. Meanwhile, some businesses are reporting dramatic drops in clientele.
“They’re killing the businesses,” Francisco Rocha, a principal with Nortenos Tortilleria, a tortilla maker, told a reporter after the meeting. Speaking in Spanish, Rocha said that since the federal sweeps began a few weeks ago, and customer demand has dropped off, his business has been forced to reduce its working time from five days a week to three.
In response to an audience question, Young acknowledged the extreme fear.
“I certainly agree that the fear — the terror — that is present in the Hispanic community. It’s not a good thing for our city,” Young said, emphasizing that he wants “quality arrests” over quantity.
“The Hispanic population has been the fastest growing population in Memphis for the last five years. I want that to continue. Which is why our team is doing all that we can to push that task force to focus on something other than immigration. We do not have an immigration issue in Memphis. We have a crime problem.”
Tense moments

Sandra Pita, an activist with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, told the audience that her own daughter had recently been stopped by a Shelby County Sheriff’s deputy.
About 10 minutes later, Border Patrol agents showed up, examined her daughter’s paperwork, and let her go, Pita told a reporter later. She said her daughter, who was born in the United States, was driving 45 miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone, and the deputy let her go with a warning.
Pita told the audience she thought the traffic stop was a clear case of racial profiling against Hispanics – and added that her daughter had voted for Young.
Young responded that he’s constantly asking the task force to focus on violent crime, and he said he’s asked about allegations that law enforcement is targeting immigrants in traffic stops.
“I ask them specifically ‘Is it racial profiling?’ Their response is that ‘We’re making valid traffic stops.’
The audience began to murmur. A woman shouted, “You’re being ignorant on purpose!”
“Who’s being ignorant by asking a question and telling you a response that doesn’t make sense?” Young responded.
“It’s not being ignorant,” Young continued. “I’m not saying it’s not happening. I’m explaining what is said when I bring the concern to the people that are responsible.”
“I understand the frustration in the room,” he continued. “I’m frustrated, but I have a responsibility to stay at the table, to try and navigate us. Because I promise you, if you walk away from the table, it will be worse.”
Another audience question came from Miguel Angel Valdez with Spanish-language news outlet MSV Noticias.
With ICE agents and other federal authorities frequently wearing masks, Valdez asked what he should do if masked people appear outside his house with guns, refuse to identify themselves, and refuse to show a warrant.
He asked if he called 911, would Memphis police come and help him?
After some back-and-forth, Chief Davis said yes, they would.
“And if there’s some confusion, if you call 911, we’re coming,” Davis said. “And we’re going to help to determine whether or not that individual is legitimate or not.”
“We did that just recently at a food truck. A call came in, a 911 call came in. People weren’t identified. Our officers went to that scene to make sure that that person wasn’t getting kidnapped,” Davis said.
One audience member asked how long the current situation would last.
Young responded that he doesn’t know.
“But I will tell you how it happened in DC. The surge . . . lasted 35 days. So, we expect that this surge will last somewhere between 35 to 45 days.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Paul-Young-and-Cerelyn-Davis.jpeg,,,2025-10-23 06:17:23.591167

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)A cash flow problem that may leave the city of New Orleans without enough money to pay its bills for the rest of the year is due in part to the fact that it has not received an expected $120 million advance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
It’s a reality that city officials blame not just on the ongoing federal government shutdown but also on policies the Trump administration has leveled  against “sanctuary cities” that don’t cooperate with federal government’s hard-line immigration policies.
The city may now be at risk of not having enough funding to cover payroll for thousands of its employees.
The news comes as the city stares down a $160 million budget deficit that will require it to spend down its reserve fund as well as adopt new revenue-generating measures — all while it prepares and passes its budget for next year.

Now, the city will likely have to take on debt in order to cover its bills for the rest of the year — in addition to implementing cost-saving measures across the board. But given the city’s dour financial outlook, it might be difficult for the city to easily access a line of credit.
“I can tell you that the council was not aware that [the federal funding], pretty much, was the determining factor on whether or not we’d be making payroll for the end of the year,” Councilwoman at-large Helena Moreno, who takes office as mayor of New Orleans in less than three months, said at an emergency budget hearing the New Orleans City Council held Wednesday.
That $120 million in FEMA funds was supposed to come as part of the $2 billion Joint Infrastructure Recovery Request program, wherein the city and the Sewerage & Water Board pooled federal post-Katrina recovery funding to work together to fix long-neglected roads and drainage infrastructure. The city, which was slow to spend the money at first, has since signed extensions with FEMA, so that it can continue to upgrade infrastructure, especially roadwork.
Though such FEMA funds are usually paid as reimbursements for work already performed, for the roadwork, the city negotiated an advance payment system, The Times-Picayune reported.
Compliance still patchy as New Orleans senior homes face disaster planning mandates, fines

According to interim Chief Administrative Officer Joe Threat, the city put in a request in August to again extend its agreement with FEMA, so it could continue to receive regular advances on that funding. While that request got approved by regional administrators, it has been sitting on national administrators’ desk without movement, Threat said. Now, with the federal government going into its third week of a shutdown, there appears to be little movement on paying the $120 million expected by city officials.
“In the change of the administration and the way FEMA looks now and the whole federal government, there was an initiative to claw back grants, cancel grants and close out the Katrina disaster,” Threat said at the Wednesday council hearing.
But the shutdown wasn’t the only factor throwing this program into question, city Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Arthur Walton said. It was also the fact that the Trump sees New Orleans as a “sanctuary city,” meaning it limits its cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The New Orleans Police Department and the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office both have policies, imposed by federal court orders, that place limits on their employees working with federal immigration authorities and prohibiting them from conducting their own immigration investigations. Trump previously threatened to withhold funds from New Orleans because of those so-called “sanctuary policies” during his first term in office.
The Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to cancel congressionally authorized funding to states and local governments that don’t pledge full cooperation with the president’s hardline immigration agenda. Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristie Noem to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions.
Along with New Orleans, other Democratically-led states and cities have faced similar threats and losses of funding in Trump’s second term. Last month, a federal judge ruled that the administration could not withhold funds from states simply because they are not using their resources to conduct immigration enforcement — which is legally a federal matter, not a state or local one. More recently, Trump has tried to withhold funding from local governments because, the administration says, they “promote or advance” diversity, equity and inclusion — or DEI — programs, also prompting litigation.
Walton said that he traveled to Washington to speak with the New Orleans congressional delegation about the possibility of extending the JIRR program — and ensuring the city could access federal money for road repair.
But he added that the delegation is also considering another step: removing New Orleans from a Trump administration list of sanctuary cities.
“So, they’re in the process now of advocating having us removed from the list,” Walton said.
‘Kept in the dark’
The announcement of the cash flow issue — paired with the continuing conversations over the deficit — has spooked city workers, who fear that they may not be paid through the end of the year.
Amanda Fallis, a librarian at the New Orleans Public Library and president of the union representing city workers, told Verite News that city workers must be paid — and should not be a casualty as city officials work to stabilize the budget.
“We were kept in the dark by the administration, and [the] budget they have obfuscated should not be balanced on our backs,” Fallis said, adding that a lack of transparency has been a hallmark in the union’s relationship with the Cantrell administration for the past eight years.
Union members plan to hold a press conference at City Hall on Thursday (Oct. 23), where they will demand the city not engage in any furloughs or layoffs of city workers because of the budget crunch.
Union members hope that Moreno will keep her campaign promise to support city workers in-house and minimize the number of contractors.
“We can make this city work with the employees we have and the budget hole that’s been created if we receive a new and dynamic administration that sees the value of prioritizing open communication, transparency, training and developing its existing workforce,” Fallis said.
ICE raids spook New Orleans officials, local Latinx communities

The question of how bad the city’s financial situation is has been a persistent one this year, first prompted by Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s decision early this year to withdraw from a $20 million legal settlement with the Orleans Parish School Board. At the time, Director of Finance Romy Samuel warned that the city could not afford the settlement, but there was little consensus or communication from the Cantrell administration about the actual extent of the city’s budgetary challenges.
There were also questions about the impact of a New Year’s Day terror attack — and the resulting high-level, expensive security that followed as the city hosted the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras. Typically, that level of security would be eligible for federal reimbursement, but that did not come. And months later, the city appeared to be tens of millions in the hole for overtime pay.
It is not clear why the city did not get reimbursed for that spending
There was also a snowstorm in late January, which blanketed the city with nearly a foot of snow, but the city did not get a federal emergency or disaster declaration, making it ineligible for reimbursement by FEMA, leaving the city on the hook for the costs incurred by the storm.
But those two events alone do not explain the extent of the deficit.
The city also overestimated the amount of money it would receive in general fund revenue by more $100 million, with the state’s top auditor calling the initial projections overly optimistic. This is not the first time that the city has over-projected its general fund expenditures — or outspent the general fund. But it has been cushioned in recent years by a large influx of federal dollars and a high reserve fund.
“It was a perfect storm,” Romy Sameul, the director of finance, said at the meeting, pointing to overtime, revenue loss and measures taken by the state and federal governments.
For Nellie Catzen, the executive director for the Committee for a Better New Orleans, which runs a program to educate and involve residents in the city’s budgeting process, the latest iteration in the budget saga is yet another example of why more transparency into the city’s budget is necessary.
“This would not have been a surprise to anyone if we all had the information that we need about public funding, public budgeting and where we are on a regular basis,” Catzen told Verite News. “We have been demanding transparency for a long time. We have gotten very little from this administration around creating more visibility into spending, both for people outside City Hall and, importantly, for people inside City Hall.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While she acknowledged that many of these budget stressors could not be entirely foreseen, Catzen also stressed that more transparency would have  been critical in mitigating the impact of those stressors. And crucially, in her opinion, there wouldn’t be continuing, new revelations about the extent of the deficit had there been regular reporting on city spending.
“Had our system been transparent, we could have been more responsive to the situation as it was developing rather than now, on the back end, having to see how the dust has settled and see what a horrible situation we are in,” Catzen said.
As to how she hopes the council will approach stabilizing the budget, Catzen hopes that the city won’t lean on well-worn austerity measures, like slashing the city services that residents rely on.
“I’m more interested in efficiency than austerity,” Catzen said.

(Getty Images)Congress loves to talk about “waste, fraud and abuse” in government health programs. It’s the all-purpose excuse for pushing through the largest cuts to health care in history. But the truth is that the real waste and abuse aren’t coming from poor families on Medicaid or from overworked state officials. It’s coming from the corporate insurers who profit from the very programs Congress claims to be protecting.
Take the recent West Virginia audit that discovered about $32 million in overpayments related to people who were ineligible — including some who were incarcerated or deceased. Yes, this is significant and must be corrected. Eligible West Virginians should not be denied access to health care based on administrative inconsistencies and errors. 
As reported by West Virginia Watch, according to Cindy Beane, Commissioner of the West Virginia Bureau for Medical Services, the state mistakenly made payments to the managed care organization (MCO) for ineligible people. Medicaid eligibility determinations rely on data provided by the state, and the bureau contracts with Mountain Health Trust and its MCOs to oversee care for roughly 87% of West Virginia’s Medicaid enrollees  Those services are delivered through three MCOs — Aetna, The Health Plan and Unicare — which receive monthly capitation payments for each enrolled member. Beane noted that the agency was already working to recover the mistaken payments when the audit took place. 
The $32 million pales when compared to multi-billion-dollar abuses, improper payments, overbilling and overcharging by private insurers that are documented in dozens of cases across the U.S.
Here are real examples:

In August 2024, Humana, a major insurer, agreed to pay $90 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit that claimed it overcharged the federal government in its Medicare Part D drug program. The accusations included misrepresenting costs to get a more favorable contract, which led to higher payments from taxpayers. 
Earlier in 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a False Claims Act complaint against three national insurers — Aetna, Elevance Health and Humana — and three large broker organizations. The government alleges that from 2016 through at least 2021, these insurers paid hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal kickbacks to brokers in exchange for enrolling people into their Medicare Advantage plans. These kickbacks apparently skewed enrollments away from people who might be costlier to cover, including those with disabilities. 
There are “ghost networks” in provider directories: directories that insurers are required to maintain but are misleading. For example, in New York, an investigation found that 86% of mental health provider entries in some insurers’ directories were “ghosts” — providers either unreachable, not accepting patients, or not in-network in practice. One insurer, MVP, was forced to pay a settlement and reimburse members. 
Insurers are also using diagnosis coding strategies (“upcoding”) and questionable documentation to receive higher payments from Medicare. For instance, Medicare Advantage organizations have been accused of submitting inflated diagnoses for enrollees — some of which have little or no basis in the patients’ records — in order to make patients appear sicker and thus receive higher payments from Medicare. Some of these practices reportedly cost billions. 

These are not isolated mistakes. They are systemic practices by large private entities profiting from public dollars and public needs.
Unlike public programs, which are accountable to taxpayers and lawmakers, private insurers are accountable only to their shareholders. Their incentives are backward: every claim denied, every appointment delayed, every patient discouraged from seeking care is a win for the bottom line. Studies routinely show that administrative waste and inefficiency within private insurance add up to tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars every year — a staggering sum compared to the $32 million mistake in West Virginia.
So when Congress says it’s cutting “waste, fraud and abuse” and state lawmakers use audits like West Virginia’s to justify slashing health care programs, what they’re doing is redirecting attention away from the big money abuses that they seldom touch. The moral framing gets flipped: those insisting on safety nets are painted as wasteful; the profit-seeking firms pulling strings behind the scenes are barely scrutinized.
The West Virginia audit shouldn’t be weaponized to slash care. Oversight should be intensified against insurers, not increased burdens placed on patients. Reforms should target kickback schemes, inflated diagnosis codes, ghost networks, denials of care and massive administrative waste. And before any more cuts are made to health care programs for vulnerable populations, there must be full accountability for where the real losses are happening.

(Photo by Rich Clarkson/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) Recently I’ve had occasion to look into the 1960s world of Lexington and the University of Kentucky, particularly the fraught nexus of the two with race. It’s been an interesting journey through local myth, oral histories and, of course, basketball. 
By the time I got to Kentucky in 1992 it had been 20 years since Adolph Rupp had coached the Wildcats and 15 years since his death. But he was still a dominating presence in Wildcat and Lexington lore, his name even enshrined on the basketball arena 
As my family could tell you, big time sports, whether so-called amateur or professional, are not my thing. I’ve learned to hate Duke and to avoid driving into town on Tates Creek/High Street on game nights but beyond that I’m a Kentucky men’s basketball agnostic.
Perhaps that’s why it was years before I learned about Rupp’s reputation as a racist. And it was even longer before I came to understand that for decades that reputation was largely responsible for a yawning gap between the university and the Black community in Lexington. 
If you type “was Adolph Rupp racist” into a search engine you get a lot of results, most of them pretty sympathetic to the man still known as the Baron of the Bluegrass. Wikipedia for its part walks delicately around the issue. “Rupp’s views on racial issues and interest in signing black players remains a subject of dispute, with Rupp denying accusations of racism during his tenure at Kentucky,” a sentence so nuanced in Wiki world that it requires four citations. 
John Oswald was president of Penn State after leaving UK. (University of Kentucky photo)
One person who was much less ambivalent was John Oswald, president of UK from 1963 to 1968. Oswald was no stranger to college sports. As an undergraduate at DePauw University he played varsity football, captaining the team one year, and lettered in basketball and track.
Oswald was eager to see UK’s teams integrated and went himself on recruitment visits to the homes of Nate Northington, one of the two first Black football players at UK, and of Wes Unseld, who wound up playing basketball at Louisville. 
Oswald recounts in a 1987 oral history interview that when he got to UK he broached the subject of recruiting Black basketball players with Rupp. “It was clear if he wasn’t a bigot, he sounded like one. He used the word n – – – – –  all the time and he used other names to refer to them, a jig and so on.”
Nonetheless, Oswald persisted and suggested Rupp try to recruit Lew Alcindor, who later became one of basketball’s greats as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and at the time was considered the best high school player in the nation. Rupp was willing to consider Alcindor, Oswald said. 
“‘If I get a n – – – – -, he’s got to be the best,’” Oswald recalled Rupp saying. The Baron of the Bluegrass fretted about the criticism he might endure if he had a Black player and benched him. “‘They’d all give me hell every day. … I cannot have one unless he is absolutely going to be among the top five but better the top one or two. That’s why I’d take Alcindor if I could get him.’” 
Of course, he didn’t get him. Nor did he get any of the outstanding Black players in Lexington, depriving his UK teams of some great local talent.
S.T. Roach (University of Kentucky Special Collections Research Center)
During many of the years he was coaching at UK two Black high schools in Lexington were excelling at basketball in the segregated system. At Douglass, Charles Livisay’s teams finished second in the 1953 National Negro basketball tournament and won the Kentucky High School Athletic League championship in 1954. (The KHSAL was the Black counterpart of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association). His 1957 team competed in the first integrated KHSAA-sanctioned basketball tournament in Lexington, beating Nicholasville 87-45 in the opening round. In 22 years of coaching at Dunbar, S.T. Roach “amassed 512 wins, captured six regional titles, and secured two Kentucky High School Athletic League” championships, the Black Sports Hall of Fame writes. After integration, Roach’s teams competed in two KHSAA Sweet Sixteen tournaments. 
The families, friends and fans of those players never had a hope of seeing them play at the University of Kentucky where Rupp fielded all-white teams for 41 of his 42 seasons as coach. 
All of this made life even more complex for the few dozen black undergraduates at UK in the ’60s. P.G. Peeples, the longtime head of the Urban League in Lexington, went to UK to finish his degree after attending Southeast Kentucky Community College close to his home in Lynch. While he was proud to be at UK, “I never had any association or identity and pride in that basketball thing,” he explained in a 1993 interview. He soon understood that was also true of the people whose young athletes had been shunned for so many years. “I got here and started to learn … what a gap there was between the Black community and the University of Kentucky, … sometimes I would take that (UK) sweatshirt and put it inside out when I’d come downtown.” 
This little history lesson may seem to come out of nowhere. But I thought it was worth recounting in this moment. Another season of UK basketball is upon us in an arena that remembers Rupp while powerful figures in Washington and Frankfort tell us to deny the history of racial prejudice and exclusion that is part of his legacy. Kentucky fans may be willing to forgive the legendary coach but no one should forget this part of his legacy.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-81399523.jpg,,,2025-10-23 05:57:12.874010

Pictured to his left are Dr. Cheryl Huckins and Dr. Simin Beg. Oct. 22, 2025 | Photo from the Committee to Protect Health Care.The consequences of Congressional Republicans’ decision to let important Affordable Care Act tax credits expire on Jan. 1, 2026, will be dire for those seeking access to vital federal marketplace insurance plans and health care, advocates told a Michigan Senate panel on Wednesday.
Members of the Senate Health Policy Committee parsed the issue and sought to better understand how average Michiganders would be affected by the move. 
The panel, and Michigan Democrats across the board, have been warning that nearly 500,000 Michiganders who have benefited from the act’s enhanced premium tax credits will be hit with a spike in insurance costs now that the Republicans in Washington have opted to let those credits expire at the turn of the year.
Some might see their health care costs double or triple, Democrats have argued, resulting in delayed or ignored health care assessments or procedures, or exorbitant debt if the procedures are most necessary.
That could also lead to premium increases for all users of the federal marketplace.
“For several years now, we have seen the enhanced premium tax credit open the door to more folks being insured and having access to health care. This has not only led to better health outcomes for these individuals, but has helped to grow the insurance pool and lower costs for everyone,” Sen. Kevin Hertel (D-St. Clair Shores), the committee’s chair, said. “The deliberate decision to not extend these critical tax credits is reckless, shortsighted, and will result in irreparable harm to families throughout our state. It’s time for leaders in Washington to put partisan politics aside and get this done for the American people.”
Hertel has also sponsored a Senate resolution calling on Congress and President Donald Trump to restore and permanently extend the enhanced tax credit, in addition to holding Wednesday’s hearing.
US Senate Dems push GOP for extension of expiring health care subsidies

Those giving testimony on Wednesday echoed the same sentiment: by terminating the credits, those enrolled in the ACA marketplace and beyond will face insurance price hikes.
“Enhanced premium tax credits have been among the most effective tools we’ve had in reducing the number of uninsured Michiganders and making health care more affordable for working families,” Rachel Richards, fiscal policy and government relations director for the Michigan League for Public Policy, said. “Letting these credits expire would devastate hundreds of thousands of people who are already struggling with rising costs for everything from groceries to housing.”
Dominick Pallone, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, said rising health care premiums, increasing prescription drug costs and high cost claims will leave both employers and consumers facing “sticker shock” when it comes time to pay health care bills.
“Enhanced premium tax credits help hundreds of thousands of Michiganders afford health insurance,” Pallone said. “There is still time for Congress to act and extend these tax credits to help make health care more affordable, and we look forward to continuing to partner with state policymakers on efforts to address the root causes of these historic premium increases.”
Dr. Farhan Bhatti, Michigan’s lead for the Committee to Protect Health Care and a family physician in Lansing, said that too many patients are already struggling to get by while costs for health care also rise.
“Physicians know too well that when patients aren’t able to afford health care, they often simply go without,” Bhatti said. “Their health conditions become worse, unnecessarily, and more difficult and expensive to treat. People are forced to seek care in the hospital, raising uncompensated care costs and raising premiums for everyone. Allowing the ACA enhanced premium tax credits to expire will cause harm to the health and financial security of patients like mine and all Michiganders.”
Poll: Majority of Michiganders support holding the line on ACA subsidies
The conversation before the Senate panel is set against the backdrop of the ongoing federal government shutdown fight in Washington, where the ACA credit extension is a major sticking point.
A new poll released by progressive policy advocates Progress Michigan shows that a majority of Michiganders support Democratic lawmakers standing firm in negotiations to ensure that the subsidies and the credits remain in place – even if it means a continuation of the temporary shutdown.
According to the group’s latest Lake Effect poll, conducted between Oct. 16-17 with interviews from 679 residents, 54% said they supported Congress holding out on passing a budget until the subsidies are extended.
“This is about more than numbers on a spreadsheet. It’s about real people being able to afford doctor visits, prescriptions, and vital care,” said Denzel McCampbell, Progress Michigan managing director. “Michiganders are calling on Congress to prioritize affordable health care, not cave to a dangerous MAGA President and his cronies who care more about building a ballroom at the White House than the ability for Americans to afford life-saving care.”

Glenn Youngkin in September 2025. Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryA yearslong legal challenge to Gov. Glenn Youngkin over access to records concerning his administration’s changes to voting rights restoration entered a new chapter this year, after the Virginia Court of Appeals in August ruled that the case, lodged by the Virginia NAACP, can move forward. 
A court had issued an order in Youngkin’s favor in 2024, but its failure to address attorneys fees led to the successful appeal that has continued the case. Late last month, Youngkin petitioned Virginia’s Supreme Court to appeal the continuation of the case, with his legal team arguing that the law doesn’t mandate attorneys fees be included in the substance of a case and that the NAACP’s complaints about the lingering attorney’s fees issue came months after the 2024 ruling.
Virginia Court of Appeals rules NAACP’s voting rights FOIA lawsuit against Youngkin isn’t over

“The need for a clear, bright-line rule is evident in this matter,” Youngkin’s petition to the state Supreme Court stated. As the governor, his legal representation stems from the office of the attorney general. 
In response to Youngkin’s petition, lawyers for the NAACP countered that the fees are a minor part of the larger issue their lawsuit is trying to address: whether the administration skirted Virginia Freedom of Information Act rules concerning their inquiry into how the administration handles voter rights restoration.  
“He’s tried to make a big deal out of (the fees) being the focus,” said Ryan Snow, the NAACP’s legal counsel. “The focus is not on the fees. The focus is having our day in court and being able to show a court that there was a violation (of FOIA).”
 Background

In Virginia, people who are convicted of felonies lose their right to vote unless a governor restores that right. While three previous governors, both Republican and Democratic, had streamlined the process for ex-felons to restore their voting rights, Youngkin adjusted the process back to a petition-based one. His administration has provided little guidance on what may yield a successful outcome and who would be unlikely to be told “yes.”  Voter restoration numbers have been lower under his administration than they were during his predecessors’ administrations. 
Calling it “a long and hard process,” Virginia NAACP president Cozy Bailey added that the group’s scrutiny of the revised process “began when we noticed the falling off a cliff, if you will, of restoration numbers.”
Several people whose restoration applications were denied said last year they were frustrated they couldn’t participate in presidential and local elections. The NAACP had filed FOIA requests in 2023 to learn more about the restoration process under Youngkin’s watch, citing a lack of transparency as their key concern. 
Acting in what former Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter called “good faith,” the administration released some documents that provided some insight. Materials suggested how completion of probation or repayment of fines might be a factor in Youngkin’s approval but further details were not disclosed.
However, the information Youngkin’s camp shared tipped the NAACP off about the existence of a database where petitions were stored,  which they argued should have been revealed through their FOIA. 
Prior to the case being allowed to continue this summer, a district judge last year sided with Youngkin over an exemption in state code dubbed “working papers,” and allowed the alleged database to stay hidden. 
Snow said that his team believes the database “is still a live issue” that they want access to, along other records the NAACP had sought, including documents about the transition in the method for restorations, records about the information needed for applicants to petition, documents about meetings to discuss aspects of the restoration procedure, and communications with denied applicants. 
While some of those records were revealed in the “good faith” release, the NAACP’s legal team believes they were “initially unlawfully withheld,” which they say they “can prove to a court.”
 As legal saga continues, a constitutional amendment is on the horizon

While Youngkin and the NAACP’s dispute continues to play out and he prepares to vacate his role as governor, Virginia’s legislature is in the process of advancing a constitutional amendment that could allow restorations to happen so long as ex-felons have completed their sentences. 
The proposal, which has advanced with slim bipartisan support, must pass again in 2026 before it could appear on statewide ballots next November. From there, voters around the state could decide to accept or reject it. If voted down,  Virginia’s next governor would be able to uphold Youngkin’s petition-based restoration process or embrace the automatic process previous governors used.  
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger supports the amendment and said in an interview that if it fails, she will prioritize restoring peoples’ voting rights. Earle-Sears did not indicate a position on the voting rights measure, unlike her signatures expressing opposition to other advancing constitutional amendments. 
Bailey, of the NAACP, emphasized that as his organization engages in the legal process, he remains hopeful that more Virginians will eventually be able to engage in the democratic one. 
“It is a human right to be able to participate in the process of electing officials and having a voice,” he said.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s private institutions are lobbying to increase state funding for the Tuition Assistance Grant program as the governor prepares his final budget, to be presented in December. This week, the institutions cited their contributions to the state’s economic successes and growing workforce as reasons for the commonwealth to in turn make a bigger investment into higher education amid federal uncertainty.
The purpose of the grant program is to provide financial assistance to Virginia residents who are attending accredited private, nonprofit colleges and universities for purposes other than religious training or theological education.
Christopher Peace, president of the Council of Independent Colleges in Virginia (CICV), which represents 28 private colleges and universities, said at a Monday press conference that graduates from private colleges in the commonwealth have made the case for additional monies for the grant program, generating $4.6 billion in annual economic output and employing nearly 30,000 Virginians.
“Families are now facing less access to federal loans, smaller grants and greater uncertainty, especially middle-income and lower-income Virginians and first-generation college families,” Peace said. “That’s why the Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant has never been more important. TAG is a steady, bipartisan commitment to ensuring access to college in Virginia, and it doesn’t depend on Washington’s next budget cycle.”
Over the past three years, lawmakers increased state appropriations for the program by raising the maximum amount each student would receive to $5,250 per student. In total, Virginia appropriates $112 million to the initiative.
(State Council of Higher Education for Virginia)
Last year, lawmakers pushed back the application deadline from July 31 to Sept. 15, giving institutions more time to identify eligible students. A report by the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia said the program saw a 5.4% increase for undergraduate residential students since the deadline adjustment.
CICV also announced the findings from the second phase of its statewide economic impact analysis conducted by Mangum Economics on Monday. The report focuses on the human capital, or the knowledge, talent, leadership and problem-solving skills that graduates have contributed to the commonwealth’s workforce and communities.
During the academic year 2023-2024, CIVC’s institutions conferred 39,871 degrees and awards to 5,356 health profession graduates and 5,205 education graduates. The largest field of graduates was in the field of business, with 6,919.
Mangum estimated that the enhanced productivity and lifetime earnings of graduates are estimated to add $161.6 million annually to Virginia’s economy.
Peace said there’s always room for growth to meet the workforce demand, including in the area of health care. He added that CICV has 15 private nursing colleges in Virginia that produce almost 40% of all nursing degree graduates. 
“We know that there’s a critical nurse shortage, and if we don’t have nurses moving in and attaining master’s level, we will have a future greater shortage in those who can educate nurses,” Peace said. “We have a pipeline issue now that we’re meeting a demand for, but you’re going to have a greater problem in the future based on some of the actions at the federal government, and hopefully we can prevent some of that with state investment.”
Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Higher Education, said with the federal funding cuts to higher education — which include ending Grad PLUS loans, capping Parent PLUS, and tightening Pell eligibility, ultimately reducing the resources available to students — TAG is the “most effective tool” to fill that gap for Virginia students.
“TAG keeps college within reach for more than 20,000 in-state students every year, and ensures that the commonwealth continues to produce the talent our economy needs,” Carr said. “Every dollar invested through tag returns dividends and skilled graduates who teach, innovate and lead across Virginia. It is an investment, not just in education, but in economic security and community vitality.”

RICHMOND, Va. — The homeschooling population has been back on the rise in Virginia for the past two school years.
The number of students receiving an education at home increased last school year by 4.3%, according to the Virginia Department of Education. The year before saw an almost 6% increase.
Last year, just over 56,000 students received their education at home. That is compared to nearly 1.3 million full-time students enrolled in the state’s public schools.
The COVID-19 pandemic created an almost 56% spike in the number of students who were homeschooled during the 2020-2021 school year. The next two school years saw a drop.
When looked at over a 20-year period that starts with the 2004-05 school year, the number of homeschooled students grew by 221% in Virginia.
The top reasons for homeschooling include concerns for safety in public classrooms, fear of poor academic quality, preference for religious instruction and need for specialized education for the child.
“I can provide something for my child that the public school [system] isn’t able to offer them,” said Amy Buchmeyer, a staff attorney at the Virginia-headquartered Home School Legal Defense Association, or HSLDA.
The HSLDA is a religious organization that works to protect the rights of families who educate at home. It has repeatedly been criticized for its affiliation with the conservative Christian movement and for lobbying for causes outside the scope of homeschooling.
Buchmeyer, who was homeschooled, cited a Cardus survey that reported homeschooled students are more well-rounded in other aspects of life.
Cardus is a Christian-led think tank and the study was funded by the Baylor Center for School Leadership, a private Christian university. The study split homeschoolers into three groups: short-term, medium-term, and long-term.
Though they are less likely to pursue higher education past an associate’s degree, long-term students scored the highest in overall mental health and displayed higher levels of optimism and gratitude, according to Buchmeyer.
Homeschooled students are more likely to start families and stay married, be active in their communities, and start their own businesses, according to Buchmeyer.
 Differences between homeschool and religious exemption

The number of Virginia students who received a religious exemption has also trended up in the past two school years at about the same percent as homeschooled students. There were 6,755 students who received a religious exemption last school year.
The VDOE requires parents who choose home education to submit a notice to their local school district at the beginning of the school year and a follow-up report at the end.
Religious exemption requires an initial notification of intent with no reports on academic progress, according to VDOE.
Buchmeyer did not see this lack of academic reporting for religious exemption as a concern.
“If anything, I think there is too much regulation currently placed on home schooling,” Buchmeyer said.
Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, proposed a bill in January to require parents who opted out for religious reasons to abide by the same regulations as homeschooled parents. The bill did not advance out of the Senate.
Callie Chaplow, director of government affairs at the Christian-founded Home Educators Association of Virginia, or HEAV, said this was a win for religious freedom.
“Virginia has a long-standing tradition and legacy of religious liberty,” Chaplow said.
Home education is regulated enough, according to Chaplow. If the bill had passed, it would have been put under the superintendent’s jurisdiction.
Pekarsky’s legislation was the most discussed bill among the homeschool community, according to Chaplow. Chaplow homeschooled her children and said they found it beneficial.
 Homeschool regulation

Home education reports vary because there is no standard method of reporting results or monitoring child welfare.
“Once homeschool kids are out of an oversight situation, you know, whether that’s those check-ins that are happening or even that yearly reporting, the opportunity for both educational neglect as well as abuse becomes prevalent,” said Tess Ulrey, executive director of The Coalition for Responsible Home Education.
The coalition was founded by homeschool graduates. The organization recommends policy changes for home education requirements and published the Make Homeschool Safe Act last year as a model policy outline.
The organization supported Pekarsky’s bill. Ulrey said that because mandated check-ins are not necessary, children can be left vulnerable.
Homeschool regulation varies from state-to-state. Oftentimes, school representatives are not required to perform regular check-ins on these homes. As of September, 12 states have no requirements to start home instruction, according to the HSLDA.
Typically, homeschooled students who submit standardized tests score above the national average, but Ulrey said that data is skewed due to flawed reports. One study by Magnet ABA Therapy found homeschool graduates perform 15% to 25% better on standardized tests, although the research methods for these findings are unclear.
Religious exemption is often grouped with homeschooling in statistics, leading to inaccuracies because the educational levels of those students are not known, according to Ulrey.
“We also see that homeschool students perform consistently lower in math than their traditional school peers. Reading is kind of a flip from that,” Ulrey said. “We also know that home school children are less likely to attend university.”
Ulrey said it creates an interesting juxtaposition to see home-educated students do worse in STEM than the humanities, and it could lead to a discussion on how these aren’t on equal-footing with their peers if they choose to enter higher education.
 Funding impact at public schools

Public school districts face possible funding loss as more parents choose to educate their children through homeschooling, or private schools and charter schools. Both of the latter institutions take funding away from public schools in order to serve smaller populations.
Under President Donald Trump’s tax reconciliation bill, also known as the “big beautiful bill,” families can receive tax credit scholarships to use at private schools, including religious ones.
Those vouchers could cause Virginia public schools to lose between $222 to $956 million in funding, according to the Virginia Education Association.
The next governor could elect not to participate, according to the VEA.
“The first opportunity to opt in will come at the start of 2027, and the governor at the time should reject this voucher scheme to protect our public schools,” stated the VEA.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderWhen Georgia’s State Election Board considered a proposal to recommend that state lawmakers ban no-excuse absentee voting early last year, the Republican-dominated body shot it down, with then-newly appointed Chair John Fervier casting the deciding vote.
But in a Wednesday meeting in Atlanta, a trio of Trump-aligned board members successfully approved a similar proposal in a narrow 3-2 vote. The board will now officially recommend that the state Legislature end a practice that was adopted in Georgia back in 2005 when it reconvenes in January for the 2026 legislative session. 
A record number of Georgians voted by mail-in ballot during the 2020 presidential election due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But in the years since, absentee voting has come under increased scrutiny from Trump and his supporters, who blamed his loss in 2020 on unfounded accusations of rampant voting fraud. 
Board member Janice Johnston, a GOP appointee who introduced the recommendation, said Wednesday that absentee voting “should be the exception rather than the rule,” arguing that it poses a higher risk of voter fraud. She also appeared before a House “blue-ribbon” study committee on elections last week and urged them to end the practice, calling absentee voting “the biggest risk in the election system.”
Multiple investigations have found no evidence of widespread voting fraud in the 2020 election in Georgia despite widespread use of absentee voting.
“We cannot guarantee secrecy of the ballot if it is in someone’s home or in someone’s apartment foyer or in someone’s post office box,” she said during Wednesday’s board meeting. “We can do much better with protecting the voter and the ballot if they’re in the secure polling place.”
She also argued that Georgia’s three-week early voting period makes absentee voting unnecessary.
President Donald Trump, who previously praised Johnston and fellow board members Rick Jeffares and Janelle King as “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory,” during a 2024 campaign rally, has also called for an end to mail-in ballots ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
But Fervier vehemently opposed the recommendation, arguing that restrictions on absentee ballot access would place an unnecessary burden on voters, particularly low-income voters.
“There are a lot of people out there that work seven days a week to feed their families, make ends meet — especially now — and restricting their access to absentee voting is not fair to those people,” Fervier said.
“When you have to earn a dollar every day to feed your family, you can’t take a day off to go vote,” he added.
Sara Tindall Ghazal, the only Democratic member of the board, also opposed the proposal, arguing that there wasn’t a clear reason to change the law and noting that absentee ballots only account for a small percentage of votes cast in Georgia. During the 2024 election, roughly 5% of voters cast an absentee ballot.
“I find it ironic that, with the tremendous push for hand-marked paper ballots, that we’re actually trying to restrict access to the one lawful method of using hand-marked paper ballots,” she added.
The board also voted 3-1 to recommend that the Legislature limit the amount of time overseas and military voters have to return absentee ballots. Currently, ballots cast by Georgia voters who live overseas will be counted if they are received within three days of Election Day, so long as they are postmarked before the election. Johnston’s proposal recommends that the legislature only count ballots from overseas voters that are received by 7 p.m. on election day.
New rulemaking process begins
The board also voted 2-0 to begin the rulemaking process for a bipartisan proposal that aims to clarify the circumstances under which voters can use paper ballots rather than ballot-marking devices.
The proposal, which would outline definitions for “impossible” and “impracticable” uses of voting equipment, was presented by Salleigh Grubbs, the first vice-chair of the Georgia GOP, and Jeanne Dufort, the chair of the Morgan County Democrats, who said that adding in definitions would help election officials better understand how to comply with state laws. They developed the language in the proposal alongside board members Jeffares and Ghazal, as well as election lawyer Bryan L. Sells, who did not respond to a request for comment.
“We don’t agree on much,” Dufort said. “But on this matter, we agree wholeheartedly, and that is that our election officials deserve certainty.”
However, Ghazal expressed concern about the proposal’s wording. 
The language in the proposed rule, she said, “goes beyond the scope of what the Legislature intended to consider impossible and impractical, which I see as unexpected circumstances that arise fairly suddenly.” 
Ghazal abstained from voting on the measure.
The proposed rule is now open for a mandatory 30-day public comment period, meaning that board members can’t move forward with the rule during their next two meetings, scheduled for Nov. 7 and Nov. 12, respectively. The next meeting where the board could take action on the proposed rule is set for December.

Alabama’s low reimbursement rates have led some pediatric dentists to stop seeing patients who have coverage through the federal-state health insurance program. (Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)FLORENCE, Ala. — Sometimes, in a quiet moment between appointments, Dr. Carson Cruise runs the financial numbers through his head. They make a cold but compelling case: If he dropped all of the Medicaid patients from his small-town pediatric dental practice, he could make the same money while working far fewer hours.
Cruise, 36, owns a dental clinic in the picturesque Alabama town of Florence, home to the University of North Alabama, tucked into the rural northwest corner of the state. He and his wife have two little boys, ages 3 and 5. They sold their small family farm recently because it became too difficult to keep up with it and his practice and still have time for their family.
All of his patients are children. About half of them have their dental care covered by Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for people with low incomes. They come to his clinic from across the region, he says, and some parents drive from rural communities an hour away. He’s got a waitlist four or five months long.
“I have great relationships with a lot of these families I’ve been seeing for years,” he said. “I don’t want to leave them hanging, but it’s getting to a point where it’s really difficult to keep working at the pace we’re working and seeing the volume that we’re seeing.”
Even though more than half of Alabama children are enrolled in Medicaid, Cruise said he is the only board-certified pediatric dentist in the area who still accepts it.
Alabama is a vivid example of a national problem. Most state Medicaid programs pay dentists far less than private insurers do for the same services. As a result, not enough dentists are willing to take Medicaid patients, leaving low-income families in Alabama and many other states with limited options for providers and longer wait times when they find one.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Alabama has fewer dentists per capita than any other state except Arkansas, according to the American Dental Association. A handful of Alabama counties lack any dentist at all, while other areas — including parts of Lauderdale County, where Cruise’s clinic is located — are considered dental deserts, places where patients have to drive at least half an hour to reach a clinic.
The problem is likely to get worse: In several counties, more than half of dentists are 60 or older, while nearly half have no dentists under age 40.
States have flexibility in how they structure their Medicaid programs, including in how much they reimburse providers. Alabama Medicaid reimburses dentists about 46% of what they charge, on average, for their services.
The state pays so little for some procedures, Cruise said, that dentists lose money by providing them. Some dentists decide that treating Medicaid patients just isn’t worth it. That helps explain why, even though Alabama children get cavities at rates similar to children nationwide, they are less likely to be treated for them.
Many of those kids’ parents are also going without care. Alabama is the only state where the Medicaid program doesn’t cover any dental services for adults, with the lone exception being women who temporarily qualify for Medicaid due to pregnancy.
Those gaps in care aren’t a geographical fluke, but the result of political choices, says Zachary Schulz, a public health historian who teaches at Auburn University and who compiled the state health department’s most recent report on oral health.
“The reason we have the health system we do is because of the policies that dictate it has to be that way,” he said.










I love helping these kids. I also have two kids of my own to take care of, and I can’t subsidize this care for the state of Alabama.


– Dr. Carson Cruise, Alabama pediatric dentist


If Cruise only accepted patients with private insurance or who could pay out of pocket, he’d make far more per patient. That would allow him to cut his patient volume in half and reduce his staff and overhead costs, he said. He could work fewer days a week and potentially take home a bigger salary for himself.
That hard-eyed calculus is at odds with the cheerful murals in the exam rooms at his clinic and the vintage Disney posters lining the hallway. It’s at odds with his own conscience.
“I love helping these kids,” he said. “I also have two kids of my own to take care of, and I can’t subsidize this care for the state of Alabama.”
A dental silo
When it comes to health insurance, teeth and gums have been separated from the other parts of the body, with inferior coverage and higher out-of-pocket costs.
Medicaid coverage of dental care varies from state to state but tends to be limited. Only about half of states and the District of Columbia cover a wide range of dental services for adults, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy. The others offer limited coverage or only cover emergency procedures. Medicare, the federal health insurance for people over 65, doesn’t pay for most dental care.
Even with private plans, consumers often bear more of the cost of their dental care than they do with medical insurance. While most dental plans cover 100% of preventive services such as teeth cleanings, they tend to cover only about half the cost of major procedures, according to the National Association of Dental Plans.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

Insurers may consider dental care to be less critical than other medical care, but the lack of it can have serious, even life-threatening, consequences.
Bad oral health has been linked to heart disease, stroke, pregnancy and birth complications, dementia and a number of cancers. It can impact a person’s mental health, or even their ability to get a job, said Schulz.
As part of a research project involving Alabamians leaving prison and trying to reenter the workforce, he found that many have a hard time landing job interviews not just because of the stigma of being formerly incarcerated, but because of something as simple as not having all of their teeth.
“They won’t get the job because they look poor, or like they don’t take care of themselves,” he said. “We view a healthy mouth as a sign of money.”
‘Having to triage kids’
Recently, Cruise saw a young patient who had cavities in all 20 baby teeth. Several of those teeth were infected and abscessed.
For a patient who’s 5 or 6 years old and requires complex care, an office visit won’t work. Extensive dental work done under anesthesia has to take place in a hospital.
But Cruise’s waitlist for hospital procedures is about six months long. Sometimes, parents call begging for help with a child’s tooth pain or infection weeks or months before their scheduled procedure. Often, all he can do is call in a prescription for antibiotics to try to keep the infection in check before he operates.
“It gets to a point where you feel like you’re having to triage kids and do Third World care in a First World country,” Cruise said. He keeps a list of kids who have pain or infection.
“Those are the ones we try to triage and move to the front of the line. There’s just not enough availability to treat all of these kids efficiently.”

And yet, he counts it as a win that he’s able to treat patients in the hospital at all. Until recently, many Alabama hospitals had stopped accepting Medicaid-covered pediatric dental patients because the state’s reimbursement rate didn’t begin to cover the costs of an operating room, nurses, anesthesia or equipment.
But after dentists and other groups advocated to get the state’s rate increased, a nearby hospital granted Cruise operating room privileges and he was able to start seeing patients locally, instead of referring them two hours south to a hospital in Birmingham, where the waitlist could be a year or more. That distance had posed a problem for patients without reliable transportation.
“It shows that if we try to fix these things, we can fix them,” Cruise said. “But at the end of the day, it takes money.”
Untreated
Nearly a quarter of Alabama third graders had untreated tooth decay in 2022, according to the most recent state report, a higher rate than the national average. But the overall numbers mask a demographic divide: Children attending lower-income schools were significantly more likely to have cavities. Black and Hispanic children were more likely to have tooth decay than white children.
Dr. Stephen Mitchell, a professor at the state’s only dental school, in the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said the Alabama Medicaid program does a good job of making Medicaid coverage available to children and youth under age 21, at least when it comes to eligibility rules.
For some rural communities, a stripped-down hospital is better than none at all

But reimbursement rates are another story, though Mitchell believes state Medicaid officials are doing what they can with the limited money they have. This year, Alabama lawmakers approved a 19% increase for Medicaid, and the state has raised dental reimbursement rates three times since 2021, and still the payments are too low for many dentists to provide care to Medicaid patients.
“We’re not the wealthiest state,” he said. “We’ve got to be smart. A dollar of prevention saves a hundred dollars in treatment.”
Better-paying neighbors
Cruise has a friend who’s a pediatric dentist and works a little more than an hour’s drive from his clinic, over the state line in Mississippi. He said she is paid about 25% more than he is for the same procedures.
For a child’s tooth extraction, for example, Alabama Medicaid reimburses dentists $64. Mississippi Medicaid reimburses about $83 for the same extraction.
Alabama Medicaid just began giving dentists an extra $10 per patient per visit for dental care. It’s appreciated, Cruise said, but he hopes the legislature will do more.
No one is sure how President Donald Trump’s broad tax and spending law, which cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, will affect Alabama’s already strapped Medicaid program.
But a further reduction in state reimbursement would likely push Cruise to take the step he has long dreaded: refusing to accept Medicaid patients.
“The last thing we want at this point is a budget cut, because we’re already doing some things at a break-even or even at a loss,” he said. “If we cut that even more, it’s going to turn what’s a very tight profit margin into a negative.
“Most of us have a heart for helping these kids and we’ll do it. But you’ve got to move the needle.”

Four Republicans — state Reps. Tim Barhorst, Levi Dean, Jennifer Gross, and D.J. Swearingen — voted against the bill. Three Democrats also voted against the bill — state Reps. Christine Cockley, Ismail Mohamed, and Desiree Tims.
The Senate passed the bill in February, but the House has made significant changes, most notably by adding intoxicating hemp regulations. State Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced the bill in January. 
“I’ve heard throughout this process now for a very long time from folks in the hemp industry, ‘regulate us like marijuana, regulate us like marijuana.’ And that was the theme of this bill,” said state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville. 
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
“I think we all had agreement that that was not the intent of the hemp legislation at the federal level or here in Ohio, but we did need to do something to protect kids from these products,” said State Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman. “This legislation closes those loopholes to ensure that only 21-plus individuals are able to access these products and purchase them.”

Only a licensed hemp dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products to adults 21 and older. The dispensaries would be required to meet standards for testing, advertising and packaging. A 10% tax would be added to intoxicating hemp sales. 
“This bill creates a legal pathway for the sale of regulated, licensed, tested, safely grown, intoxicating hemp products and a limited number of hemp dispensaries,” Stewart said. 
The bill would limit the number of active hemp dispensaries to 400. The bill would allow certain hemp dispensaries to be grandfathered in if they sold intoxicating hemp products on or before Aug. 30 and hemp products sales surpassed 80% of their total sales for 2024 or the 12 months before the bill takes effect. 
However, if more than 400 dispensaries are licensed due to the grandfather provision, the Division of Marijuana Control would not be able to issue any more licensees until the number of grandfathered dispensaries dropped below 400. 
Gross, who voted against the bill, said the measure is at odds with federal law. She also said she heard from five businesses in her district that this bill “effectively kills large swaths of Ohio’s hemp industry.” 
“It is right to remove packaging which dangerously attracts children, to enforce age restrictions as well as set limits on advertising to the younger generations,” Gross said. “But this bill is not ready. … This bill takes a hatchet to these small businesses.” 
The bill defines an intoxicating hemp product as containing more than 0.5 milligrams of delta-9 THC per serving, 2 milligrams of delta-9 THC per package or 0.5 milligrams of total non-delta-9 THC per package. 
THC-infused beverages are also included in the bill. A bar or restaurant would be able to sell 5 milligram THC-infused beverages for patrons to drink on site, while a store would be able to sell 10 milligram THC-infused beverages for carry-out. 
“I think this strikes the appropriate tone of a reasonable, fair and pro-business regulatory regime, while still maintaining that these products and consumers should be safe and should only be accessible to 21-plus adults,” Fischer said. 
Under this bill, the Division of Marijuana Control in the Ohio Department of Commerce would be responsible for regulating intoxicating hemp products and the Division of Liquor Control in the Department of Commerce would be in charge of regulating THC-infused drinks. 
Jim Higdon, co-founder of Cornbread Hemp in Kentucky, which sells its products in more than 300 Ohio retail stores, called this bill “by far the strangest … in all the states that have passed hemp legislation this year.” 
“This bill appears to ban the sale of hemp edibles with more than 2mg THC per package in all groceries and convenience stores while also legalizing 10mg THC beverages in those same stores,” Higdon said in a statement. “It’s difficult to understand how that makes sense, when all these products should be simply age-gated and taxed appropriately.”
The bill “is substantially different” from when it came over from the Senate earlier this year, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima said.
“My number one priority is getting this issue resolved,” he said. “My priorities within the bill are, certainly public safety, limiting access certainly to minors, and making sure that there’s some regulating process.”
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recently announced a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14. Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Carl Aveni granted a 14-day temporary restraining order on DeWine’s executive order. The next hearing in this case is scheduled for Oct. 28.
Marijuana changes
S.B. 56 would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, limit the number of active marijuana dispensaries and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
It would keep Ohio’s home grow the same at a limit of six plants per person and 12 plants per residence. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio recreational marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment. 
“Virtually everything that Ohioans can do today under the initiated statute will be just as legal after the passage of this bill,” Stewart said. 
One change, however, is the banning of smoking in most public places. 
“Our constituents … have also made clear that we don’t want every downtown in Ohio to smell like a Grateful Dead concert,” Stewart said.
The bill would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries, which was originally included in the citizen-initiated law voters passed in 2023. 
People would also be able to apply for expungement of low-level marijuana convictions instead of getting rid of them automatically.  
“If you smoked a joint when you were 18 in 2002, in your 40s you should not have barriers to housing or employment or public services because you got in trouble when you were 18 for doing something that is now completely legal,” said Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati.

Sununu is officially in the race to challenge for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Here, Sununu is shown in a still from his campaign announcement video.(Screenshot)John E. Sununu, a Republican who served in the U.S. Senate from 2003 to 2009, announced Wednesday he’s officially seeking a return in 2026.
“Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again,” Sununu said in his campaign launch video. “I’m a bit surprised myself.”
Sununu, 61, first went to Congress to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District — which includes Manchester, Laconia, and the Seacoast region — in 1997. In 2002, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, defeating then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. His voting record as a senator included opposition to an assault weapons ban, as well a vote against a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. After one term, Sununu lost his reelection bid in a rematch with Shaheen, who has held the seat ever since. In March, Shaheen announced she wouldn’t run for reelection. Now, Sununu is seeking to return to the same seat he lost in 2008.
Sununu’s brother, Chris, served as New Hampshire governor for eight years until he stepped down from the role in January. He was widely rumored to be a candidate for this race until he publicly ruled out a campaign in April. Their father, John H. Sununu, was governor from 1983 to 1989 and served as chief of staff for President George H.W. Bush.
Now, John E. Sununu is trying to portray himself as the person who can “lower the temperature” and “calm the waters” in a politically polarized and dysfunctional Congress. He said in his campaign video he’ll have a “laser focus on the economy” and promised to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits.
“Washington’s never been perfect,” he said. “It’s not meant to be, but when I was there, people with different opinions could get together, work things out, and come to solutions that made a real difference. But now Congress just seems loud, dysfunctional, even angry.”
So far, Sununu has one primary opponent: Scott Brown, a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and U.S. ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. In September as rumors swirled about Sununu potentially entering the race, state Sen. Dan Innis ended his campaign for U.S. Senate, saying he would support Sununu. On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is in a primary race against progressive organizer Karishma Manzur.
The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has already begun targeting Sununu for his post-Senate career as a lobbyist.
“John Sununu went to Washington almost thirty years ago, then cashed in, making millions selling out to corporations and working for Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Wall Street while the people of New Hampshire paid the price,” New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said. “The only reason Sununu wants to go back to Washington now is to sell out New Hampshire to the same corporations and special interests that have lined his pockets for years.” 
Since leaving office in 2009, Sununu has been a harsh critic of President Donald Trump. One day before the 2024 presidential primary in New Hampshire, he published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union-Leader titled “Donald Trump is a loser.” In 2016, he endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for president over Trump, and in 2024, he endorsed U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. In 2025, he’s attempted to steer focus away from his criticisms of the president. In an interview with WMUR Wednesday, Sununu was asked if he would be “the pro-Trump candidate,” to which he replied, “I’m gonna be the New Hampshire candidate.”
Dante Scala, a political scientist and professor at the University of New Hampshire, noted that it’s been a long time since Sununu was a candidate.
“I’m curious to see how he adjusts to the new political environment,” Scala said. “Really, his political party is very different than the one he used to lead.”
Scala said Sununu has been “generic” in his public statements so far, “so we don’t know a lot yet about what he’s thinking about the future of his party and his role in it.”
“A big question going forward, over the next year, will be, just like it was for his brother, his relationship with the leader of his party, President Trump,” he said. “The difference is that his brother, as governor, had more flexibility. As governor, he could put some distance between himself and the goings on in Washington, DC, including the activities of Trump. His brother won’t have, automatically at least, that sort of flexibility, because he’s running for federal office.”
Scala doubts Sununu will portray himself as a full “never-Trumper,” because “I think he’s smart enough to recognize the real limitations of that and that’s a dead end in a Republican Party primary.”
“New Hampshire Republicans have had far less success running for federal office during the Trump era than for state office,” he said. “I’m sure that’s something that he’s well aware of. So I’m wondering how he’s going to try to carve out an identity that’s independent from President Trump, and how far he’s willing to go. Is he going to be the Granite State version of (Maine U.S. Sen.) Susan Collins?”
Scala said Sununu’s adult-in-the-room-style message “sounds to me like a general election message, not so much a message that does much for the party base” in a primary.
Republicans will be looking to keep their majority in the Senate in 2026. Currently, Republicans control 53 of 100 seats. A general election between Sununu and Pappas, should they win their primaries, is expected to be very expensive.
Scala attributes recent positive polling for Sununu to name recognition and the popularity of his brother. But once voters — who haven’t seen the older Sununu in public life in almost two decades — are reacquainted with him, that polling could change, he said.
“It’s Chris Sununu who’s been the political star of his family for the last decade, not his brother,” he said. “His brother is an unknown quantity to a very large number of New Hampshire Republican voters. I have my doubts that the early polling that we’ve seen reflects a voter base in the New Hampshire Republican Party that’s especially knowledgeable about John Sununu. So I’m curious, once he, once he gets out from the aura of his brother, how he fares.”
Scala thinks the big thing to look at is the national temperature.
“It’s Midterms 101,” he said. “They tend to be referenda on the president himself. What will Donald Trump’s approval numbers look like next September in New Hampshire, is a big question. It was presidential approval that doomed John Sununu back in 2008. For Jeanne Shaheen back in ‘08, it was very cut and dry, straightforward: ‘Look at what President Bush has done. John Sununu’s with President Bush. If you don’t like President Bush, vote for me.’ There’s certainly that possibility that for Chris Pappas, assuming he’s the nominee, it could be equally cut and dry.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sununuvideo-1024x609.jpeg,,,2025-10-23 05:18:06.778140

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House approved two more property tax measures Wednesday, this time tying future increases to the rate of the inflation. The latest bills come on the heels of measures empowering local commissions to roll back levies and tweaking a tax formula to allow for greater reductions.
Flanked by more than a dozen Republican lawmakers after the vote, House Speaker Matt Huffman touted more than $2.4 billion in property tax savings between the two latest proposals. That’s about 10% of the total property tax levied in the state.
Huffman said after 17 years in office, property tax reform has been one of the most intractable issues he’s faced; the prospect of a constitutional amendment abolishing property taxes helped instill a sense of urgency.
“I think this should convince a reasonable voter,” he said, “a reasonable citizen in Ohio, that something significant has been done.”

Last minute changes
On Tuesday, lawmakers voted the bills out of committee. House Bill 186 applies to what’s known as outside millage while House Bill 335 applies to inside millage.
Ohio’s constitution allows counties to levy up to 10 mills (or 1%) in property taxes without first getting the approval of voters — that’s inside millage. Any additional property taxes have to succeed at the ballot box before taking effect — those taxes are outside millage.
The distinction is important in terms of inflationary growth. Inside mills collect additional revenue as a property’s value rises, but for outside mills, Ohio uses a formula to reduce rates so revenue remains static despite rising property values. That reduction formula worked for several decades, but lately, in many parts of Ohio, it’s run out of room to cut.
So, as property values spiked, property taxes rose in tandem.
House Bill 186 would limit outside millage increases to the rate of overall inflation in the economy. The sticking point has been when to start the clock. A recent amendment pushed the base year to 2023, but school officials around the state argued that would demolish their balance sheets.
Tuesday the bill’s sponsor, state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, relented and introduced an amendment that would keep schools whole.
“What they’re actually losing in terms of less property tax revenue, we backfill that amount to the tune of roughly $360 million from the sales tax holiday fund,” he explained. “To keep schools essentially full moving forward until their next revaluation.”
The committee also made small changes to the inside millage measure. State law allows a county to voluntarily reduce its inside millage and then replace that revenue with a local sales tax. The latest changes allow them do the same with a local income tax, too.
But Thomas said it was important to add in protections, “to prevent an entity from decreasing their inside millage in year one, for example, and then year three or four coming back saying they need it when they’ve also increased taxes elsewhere.”
House debate
On the House floor, state Rep. Bill Roemer, R-Richfield, said the legislation is a straightforward answer to a clear problem.
“People are upset with the spikes,” he said. “We don’t want the spikes — 20, 30, 40, 50% increases — when people’s social security might be increasing at 2.9%,” he added.
With the state backfilling the cash schools would miss, Roemer said there wouldn’t be any true losses. But state Reps. Elgin Rogers, D-Toledo, and Daniel Troy, D-Willowick, argued many districts won’t benefit from the changes, and the property tax savings are too generous — applying to vacation homes, rentals and properties owned by out-of-state investors.
“That means that $300 million — $300 million — that could be going to homeowners and farmers will not,” Rogers said.
If lawmakers think the bills will head off an amendment abolishing property taxes, “we’re kidding ourselves,” Troy said.
“I think this is like pouring a cup of water on a forest fire,” he added.
There were critiques from the Republican side of the aisle as well. State Rep. Mike Odioso, R-Green Twp., stressed that he supports the effort, but he explained even with the state backfill, a school district he represents will get almost $800,000 less than it was planning on next year. The following year it will fall about $700,000 short of projections.
“We’ll just say it’s $1.5 million of not holding harmless,” Odioso said, and warned lawmakers may have to revisit the issue as soon as 2027.
But Thomas insisted passing the bill sends a simple message.
“If your bill spiked, it will never spike again,” he said.
The alternative is homeowners paying $1.7 billion more in property taxes over the next three years. To Thomas, the central argument in both measures, is that the sharp increases in property taxes over the last five years were wrong and “they can never happen again.”
Despite the critiques leveled against the bills both passed easily, with bipartisan support. Rep. Troy, for instance, counted himself among the supporters.
“The final version,” Troy said, “it’s kind of like the preamble of our Constitution — it’s not perfect, but it’s a hell of a lot more perfect than the way it was introduced.”

	The towering smokestacks of New England’s last coal-fired power plant have gone quiet. Merrimack Station in Bow, New Hampshire, shut down in September, years ahead of its scheduled closure, marking the end of coal-fired energy production in the region.
Merrimack Station had supplied electricity to the region since the 1960s. But as coal’s financial viability waned and environmental pressures mounted, the era of coal power production in New England may now be officially over. In the coming years, on-site solar and battery storage could take coal’s place at the site.
Granite Shore Power, Merrimack Station’s owner, officially ceased operations on Sept. 12. A 2024 settlement between the company, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Sierra Club and the Environmental Protection Agency over alleged Clean Water Act violations had required the facility to close by 2028. The early retirement underscores how coal has become economically untenable in the region.
“Coal has been challenged in New England for twenty years,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “The market no longer sustains and justifies these types of facilities.”
The station’s 438-megawatt output has steadily declined over the past two decades. Once operating at 70 to 80 percent capacity in the early 2000s, Merrimack has failed to exceed 8 percent in the past six years, running only during periods of peak electricity demand.
Older, larger coal plants like Merrimack Station, despite running only during peak periods, take a long time to power up, Dolan explained. More flexible, faster-starting natural gas “peaker” plants have now taken their place.
ISO New England, the nonprofit organization that operates the region’s electricity grid and oversees the wholesale power market, explained that it dispatches the cheapest sources first and most often—meaning coal plants like Merrimack were called upon less frequently as more affordable options became available.
Across New England, coal use fell by more than 90 percent between 2007 and 2017, displaced by cheaper natural gas and renewable power.
Entering the first New England winter without coal, the impact on the grid will be minimal. Merrimack Station accounted for just 0.22 percent of the region’s electricity generation in 2024, according to ISO New England. That shortfall can be replaced by renewables, natural gas and power imports from neighboring states.
The shutdown marks the end of a long, contentious chapter in environmental activism. In addition to litigation, Merrimack Station has been a flashpoint for protests for years.
The No Coal No Gas campaign, spearheaded by 350 New Hampshire and the Climate Disobedience Center, began in 2019 with the goal of shutting down the station. Activists staged a series of civil disobedience actions, including attempts to “liberate” coal before combustion, blockading shipments, and even occupying the station’s smokestack. Over the years, the campaign has resulted in over a hundred arrests and drawn national attention to New England’s lingering dependence on fossil fuels.
“We’re very excited,” said Rebecca Beaulieu of 350 New Hampshire. In 2023, Merrimack Station failed an emissions test that found particulate matter levels 70 percent above federal limits, along with elevated mercury and nitrogen oxide, and for every hour the plant operated, it emitted more carbon dioxide than the average American does in 26 years. “Knowing the plant will never power up again, even for an hour, is a huge relief,” she said.
While the closure brings uncertainty for Merrimack Station employees, many of whom have been transferred to other Granite Shore Power sites, both activists and the utility hope that the station’s next phase will present new job and economic opportunities for New Hampshire.
“The historic agreement with the EPA paves the way for first-of-their-kind ‘Renewable Energy Parks’ in the state,” Granite Shore Power said in a statement last year. Both Merrimack Station and Schiller Station—another Granite Shore Power facility that ended coal operations in 2020 —are slated to be converted into renewable energy and battery storage sites. The company says roughly 400 acres of land and existing grid infrastructure will make the transition possible.
Granite Shore Power credited the Inflation Reduction Act for helping make its renewable-energy plans financially feasible. But with the Trump administration moving to roll back renewable-energy incentives, the policy environment for such projects has grown uncertain.
Just weeks after Merrimack Station shuttered, the administration announced that the Department of Energy would invest $625 million in coal-related projects aimed at reviving the industry. Federal officials have not commented on the plant’s closure.
As Granite Shore Power enters a new era of coal free energy production, the No Coal No Gas campaign is turning towards oil- and gas-fired peaker plants that operate during peak demand times, including two kerosene turbines at the Merrimack Station site.
“These inefficient oil and gas facilities receive monthly ratepayer subsidies, but sit idle most of the year,” the campaign said in a statement. “When they are called to operate at times of high electricity demand, they do so with extra-high pollution at extra-high costs.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Merrimack-Station-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-23 05:00:30.372690

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio Republicans have still not proposed a congressional map, and it’s a week away from their constitutional deadline to pass a bipartisan proposal.
The first state redistricting commission meeting ended in jeers from the public, begging the GOP to “do their jobs.” Now, Democrats in D.C. are discussing recourse if they believe the map passed is gerrymandered.
In front of the Ohio Redistricting Commission, Democratic leaders urged their colleagues to accept their proposed redistricting map, or at least negotiate with them to create a joint proposal before the Oct. 31 deadline.
“We’ve always been open to good faith, fair negotiation and compromise, but that requires both sides to show up,” said ORC Co-Chair and Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood.
The ORC’s five Republicans and two Democrats are tasked with drawing the state’s 15 U.S. House districts. The group is made up of two Republicans and two Democrats in the Statehouse. The three remaining seats include the governor, secretary of state and auditor.
Ohio’s congressional districts are currently composed of 10 Republicans and five Democrats.
On average over the last decade, Republicans won 55% to 45% of the vote over Democrats in Ohio. With that breakdown, Democrats proposed a map with eight seats leaning red and seven leaning blue.
The Republicans still haven’t introduced their map yet, prompting dozens of citizens to wear shirts saying, “Where is the map?”
After Antonio and House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn testified in support of their map, Republicans swiftly adjourned the meeting.
“The ball is kind of in the Democrats’ court to decide what deal they are or not willing to take,” ORC Co-Chair Brian Stewart (R-Ashville) said. “Certainly, you don’t have to squint very hard to see what the contour of a deal could look like,”
GOP leaders have said they want at least 12 or 13 of the 15 districts to lean Republican.
“I think Republicans in our caucus generally think that we could have a map that includes some additional seats that Republicans could be competitive in,” Stewart said.
Democratic Reps. Emilia Sykes of District 13 in Northeast Ohio, Marcy Kaptur of District 9 in Northwest Ohio and Greg Landsman of District 1 in Southwest Ohio are all at risk, Stewart confirmed.
But it’s unclear how the GOP wants to do that, since they haven’t submitted any proposals. Stewart was asked why the public can’t see any drafts or proposals from Republicans.
“If there is a bill, a map, that has enough support to pass — that will get introduced and we’ll have a debate and take a look at it,” Stewart responded. “We’re not going to just show all of our notes in public while you’re trying to have discussions between legislative leaders about what they wouldn’t support.”
The Democrats are frustrated, arguing that the GOP is deliberately slowing this process.
“If it’s slow-walked through the month of October, it leads to November, when the Republican majority can just pass a map of their own with only their members voting,” Antonio said.
To meet the October deadline, at least four members of the ORC, including two Republicans and two Democrats, must approve. They must also have two public meetings if they intend to pass a map. If that fails, it goes back to the legislature.
Starting in November, Republicans can pass a map with just a simple majority, not needing Democratic support.
But just this weekend, U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Antonio talked on the phone about next steps, she said.
“They’re looking at every option and every opportunity to be supportive of, should it come to a referendum, what that would look like,” Antonio said.
If the lawmakers pass a map in November, voters can come together to put a referendum on the ballot, attempting to repeal the passed map and block its implementation. Eventually, a referendum campaign would need to get nearly 250,000 signatures in 90 days after the law has been signed and filed.
“There’s a lot of energy for a potential referendum,” Isaacsohn said. “I think people are fired up by the prospect of getting access to fair maps that they deserve.”
If passed by the commission, the map isn’t subject to a referendum.
Stewart was asked if there were any deals that could be made to avoid a referendum.
“I think, clearly, there are pros and cons to all the different paths that we have,” he responded. “When I say I’m optimistic that phase two could result in a map, I am.”
Another ORC meeting should take place this month, but it hasn’t been announced yet.

(Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)I would pay money not to have Doug Girod’s job.
As chancellor of the University of Kansas, Girod has to navigate the state’s premier higher education institution through choppy waters while placating lawmakers and the public. When the call came in late last week to conference with officials from President Donald Trump’s administration, what was Girod supposed to do? Spit in his face? The chancellor did what more people in institutions across this country should do: Talk to the White House, explain the situation as he sees it and hopefully move the conversation in a productive direction.
Please, folks in Kansas Reflector comment sections: Calm yourselves. We do not know whether KU was invited to join the group of universities the Trump administration has courted to be part of its higher education reform efforts. If it was, we do not know whether the university agreed to those terms.
All we know is that they talked.
The White House had asked nine schools to agree to a slew of rightwing restrictions in exchange for preferential access to federal funds. Seven have rejected the administration’s offer. According to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, additional universities were then invited to offer feedback.
Would KU agree to such a deal if it were offered? Count me skeptical.
Here are the asks, as reported by the Reflector’s Tim Carpenter:
“The Trump administration’s compact would mandate that schools freeze tuition for five years, limit international students to 15% of undergraduate enrollment, impose standardized tests for admission, abide by a ban on DEI programs and adopt a definition of gender that would block transgender individuals from using restrooms or participating in sports that aligned with their gender identity.
”In addition, the arrangement would forbid participating colleges and universities from allowing employees to express political views on behalf of their institutions. Academic departments offering opinions counter to views held by conservatives would have to be closed. Students and employees would be polled on compact compliance and the results released publicly. There would be financial penalties for institutions that violated pledges included in the deal.”
Some of those restrictions, such as the DEI ban, have already been instituted in Kansas. But others, such as agreeing to a half-decade tuition freeze, sound all but impossible given the looming threats to higher education. That’s not even getting into limiting the free speech rights of faculty and instituting ideological litmus tests.
Unless those terms change — and substantially — I find it difficult to  imagine KU leaping aboard the Trump train. The proposed compact would harm the university and its students.
On the other hand, telling the Trump administration why the plan falls short could help both sides move forward. As vice chair for the Association of American Universities, Girod has an interest in all of our country’s higher education institutions. He likely believed he had a responsibility to show up and speak frankly.
Listen, I don’t just find Trump reprehensible. I believe he’s a clear and present danger to our American republic, and I’ve said so. But until he departs our national stage, Americans have only an handful of options to handle the man. All have drawbacks.
First, you can refuse to engage with him or the administration at all. That gives you a moral high ground, but it also leaves you out of the current political conversation.
Second, you can throw yourself at his feet, begging him for favors and showering him with acclaim. This might win you financial or political victories, but you sacrifice your soul in the process.
Third and finally, you can try to collaborate when possible with the president and the White House, hoping to improve our country or at least limit the destruction.
Those in positions of power across our nation have to make their decisions. While it might feel satisfying to place yourself in the first group, and it might enrich you to show up in the second, those in the third might hold the keys to our country’s survival.
Universities of the United States have a vital role to play, now and in decades to come. Their graduates will build the post-Trump United States. Without great professors, sharp students and cutting-edge research, higher education will wither and our country erode from within.
Girod took a reasoned approach, refraining from either embracing or rejecting Trump. That was likely a good choice — for Kansans and KU alike.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/DSC_8218-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-23 05:00:30.372690

While Americans across the country deal with the consequences of the federal government shutdown, residents of Pennsylvania are being hit with a double blow.
Pennsylvania has been without a state budget for over 100 days – and remains the only state currently operating without a budget.
As a political scientist at Penn State who studies state politics and policy, I see how Pennsylvania’s budget impasse has ripple effects that are compounded by the current budget problems in Washington.
Let’s look at the present budget problems in Pennsylvania and what we can learn from past battles over the state budget.
 A double crisis

Double government budget crises, like the one Pennsylvania faces now, are rare. One reason is that 46 states, including Pennsylvania, begin their new fiscal year on July 1. The federal government’s fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. Even a state like Pennsylvania, that has had late budgets for eight of the last 10 years, would have to be very late in passing a budget for it to potentially coincide with a federal budget impasse. And, of course, federal government shutdowns do not happen all the time.

Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro faces a delicate political environment in Harrisburg – as he has since his first budget in 2023. The Democrats control the state House by a single seat, whereas the Republicans have a comfortable majority in the Senate.
The parties have been debating over the last several budget cycles how to handle funding surpluses – much of which came from Biden-era legislation like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act – and when and how to deal with the inevitable end to those surpluses.
This year, the two sides are far apart on their views of the proper spending level.
The Democrats in the House passed a $50.3 billion spending plan, but Senate Republicans want to keep state spending flat at $47.6 billion. The two sides have clashed over proposals surrounding school vouchers, marijuana legalization and more.
As for the federal government, Republicans have a trifecta – control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives – but do not have the 60 votes in the Senate required to overcome a filibuster. Democrats have dug in over reversing cuts to health care from the earlier passed “one big beautiful bill” and expiring Obamacare subsidies.
There is little sign of an immediate end to either impasse.
In Pennsylvania, there is growing frustration on both sides about an inability to compromise. Nationally, House Speaker Mike Johnson has speculated that this may end up being the longest federal government shutdown in history. In neither case, though, does there seem to be a great deal of urgency in coming to a compromise.
 Effects on Pennsylvania

These dual crises are affecting Pennsylvanians in many ways. The state government continues to function even without a budget, but counties, school districts and nonprofit organizations that rely on state funding are being forced to make difficult operating choices.
Some counties like Westmoreland and Northampton are beginning the process of furloughing employees. School districts are taking out loans, freezing hiring and deferring spending. The state already owes school districts more than $3 billion in missed payments for the past three months.

The social safety net is also fraying as social service organizations, like rape crisis centers and mental health providers, are also expending reserves, taking out loans and furloughing employees.
Then comes the federal shutdown.
Military families nationwide have been hit particularly hard, with many turning to food pantries to help meet their needs. The recent money maneuvers at the Department of Defense to pay active-duty and activated National Guard and Reserves personnel is temporary. The commonwealth also has the eighth-highest population of federal civilian employees, at over 66,000 who are not being paid.
Services like food banks are especially vulnerable in this situation, as they are seeing greater demand – which may increase due to federal workers going unpaid – but rely on both the state and federal governments for subsidies. Just this week, it was announced that Pennsylvanians buying health care through the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2026 should expect a 22% increase in premiums, on average. Part of that increase is due to expectations around the expiring Obamacare subsidies at the center of the Democrats’ demands in this shutdown.
All of these forces are coming together to pinch Pennsylvania residents.
 Echoes of the past

While the compounding pain of the federal shutdown is unique, long budget delays in Pennsylvania are not.
In 2023, Gov. Shapiro’s first budget was not fully passed until Dec. 14. That budget was fundamentally delayed by the acrimonious implosion of a deal on school voucher spending between the governor and Senate Republicans. The budget negotiations ended after some horse-trading on specific programs, like removing the popular Whole-Home Repairs Program started during the COVID-19 pandemic but adding funding for lead and asbestos abatement in schools.
The difference between then and now, however, is that back then the governor and General Assembly agreed on the overall budget, but typical bargaining was needed to get the votes needed to pass the spending bills after the voucher blow-up. This time, the parties are almost $3 billion apart in what should even be spent.
In the end, however, both Pennsylvania and the federal government will pass budgets, and I expect that each will be the result of protracted negotiations over multiple spending items, as Americans have seen in the past. The question is: How much pain will citizens, nonprofits and local governments face in the interim?

(Photo by Erik Gunn, States Newsroom.)Labor unions exist to negotiate legally binding collective bargaining agreements, which cover the wages, benefits, and working conditions of represented employees. But they also involve themselves in politics because they believe that some elected officials are better than others when it comes to public policy.
Usually, but not always, unions endorse Democrats. However, a few Ohio unions have already endorsed Republican Senator John Husted.
Where do unionized Ohio workers and their families stand politically in 2025, especially in terms of party identification, ideology, support for President Trump, and candidate preferences in the 2026 elections? In order to answer these questions, let’s look at some new survey data from Bowling Green State University.     
The BGSU Democracy and Public Policy Network conducted a web-based poll of 800 registered Ohio voters from October 2 to October 14. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percentage points, and while in some public presentations the data is weighted in a way that results in a +10 Trump margin from the 2024 presidential race, most of the analysis presented below relies on the unweighted results.
Respondents were given three options to indicate if they live in a union household: they are a union member themselves, or someone they live with is a union member or both they and someone they live with are union members. Seven percent report that they are a union member, 5% say someone they live with is a union member, and 2% say both they and someone they live with are.
In terms of political party preference, union people are more likely to be Democrats than Republicans. About 44% of union members are Democrats, while only 24% are Republicans. Interestingly, among those who live with someone who is a union member, 49% are Democrats, whereas only 21% are Republicans.
In terms of ideology, union folks are more likely to define themselves as liberal than conservative. For example, 47% of union members consider themselves liberal, whereas only 24% consider themselves conservative. A similar pattern occurs for those who live with a union member.
Overwhelming majorities of members of all categories of union households have a very unfavorable attitude toward President Donald Trump. For example, 64% of union members have a strongly unfavorable attitude toward the president. Overwhelming majorities also strongly disapprove of the job he is doing as president. For example, 70% of those who live with a union member strongly disapprove of the job Donald Trump is doing as president.
In terms of the 2026 Ohio governor’s race, in a hypothetical matchup between Democrat Amy Acton and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, members of all three categories of union households support Acton by more than two-to-one margins. Democrat Tim Ryan does equally well in a hypothetical matchup with Ramaswamy. Members of union households also overwhelmingly support former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in his campaign against Republican U.S. Sen. John Husted.
For the following analysis, we use the weighted data because we want to see what a sample of likely Ohio voters think about unions. We asked respondents what effect they believe the decline in the number of workers represented by unions has had. Sixty percent believe it has been somewhat or very bad for working people.  Only 40% feel like it has been at least somewhat good for working people.
What does all this tell us?
First, if Democrats ever want to be competitive in statewide Ohio elections again, they would benefit from there being more union households, and they would need them to vote.
Second, Democratic candidates could tailor messages to inspire union members and their families to turn out at the polls. This could mean a focus on so-called “bread and butter” or “kitchen table” economic issues that drive workers to unionize in the first place. Overwhelming majorities of all categories of union household members believe the national economic situation has gotten worse over the past year, as do about 54% of non-union members. Can Democrats persuade these voters that their plans will improve the economy? That could be a deciding factor in driving the union vote in 2026, and earning the votes of all workers.
Finally, even in a sample where voters recall giving President Trump a ten-point margin, voters believe the decline in union membership has been bad for workers.  This may give union organizers a better opportunity than in recent years to grow their ranks by persuading more workers that life is better in a union.

Not because he convinced me to play football for the Huskers — because as the new president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and a happily middle-aged dad and grandpa, I can tell you my run-blocking days are over.
No, Rhule helped change how I think about this state’s extraordinary promise. Like him, I wasn’t born or raised here. But we share a belief that, just like great football teams, states like Nebraska can achieve greatness by doubling down on our strengths rather than focusing on what we’re not.
Though I’m one of the state’s newer recruits, I already recognize we’ve got the talent and the track record to succeed. Now we just need the right culture — one guided by a shared vision and driven by credible data — for our state to level up and for every family to win.
It might sound straightforward, but that doesn’t mean it will be easy. Nebraska, like much of the Midwest, faced some headwinds this year. Our gross domestic product dropped more than 6% in the first quarter of 2025, which tied with Iowa for the steepest decline nationally. It was caused by several factors, including slumping agricultural markets, global trade uncertainties and immigration challenges, to name a few.
But there’s good news: As many obstacles as there seem to be, Nebraska has the tools and the world-class talent necessary to overcome them.
For example, Nebraska is known for agriculture. Despite the fact we have one of the smallest populations, our state is number one in the nation for beef exports. Our farmers and ranchers also are top two in cattle and alfalfa, and top six or better in producing corn, soybeans and sugar beets, as well as hogs, pigs, and pork.
The fact is that Nebraskans do a whole lot more with less — which helps explain why no other state is more efficient in agriculture, since we lead the nation in cash receipts per capita.

Make no mistake about it: While Nebraskans sell more than $31 billion in agricultural products annually, and one in four jobs across the state is related to agriculture, we’re far from a one-trick pony.
As the former head of the Utah Manufacturers Association, I’ve known for a while that Nebraska is a hotbed for building, fabricating and machining things. But as I travel across the state and meet more of our manufacturers, I’m still surprised by the scale.
The industry adds more than $21 billion to our state’s GDP. It supports more than 100,000 families from Seward to Scottsbluff through high-quality jobs that pay on average around $75,000. And the numbers only tell part of the story.
The Nebraska Manufacturing Alliance recently held its annual “Coolest Thing Made in Nebraska” contest. And people have been astounded to learn that everything from aluminum hurdles at track meets to customized artificial limbs — even the world’s largest folding corn head — are made in Nebraska.
Building the future isn’t exclusive to manufacturing, though. Nebraska’s booming technology sector is responsible for nearly $20 billion in annual economic output. That’s thanks to well-known names in tech like Hudl, Google, CompanyCam and Meta developing large footprints here and also to homegrown startups like Alpaca and Marble Technologies, which might be smaller but have ambitious plans that are just as big.
I don’t bring up all of Nebraska’s success just to sing the state’s praise — though I gladly will whenever I can. I bring it up because even though Nebraska is a triple landlocked state with a small populations, our achievements are proof we live in one of the most economically dynamic and diverse places to do business in the country.
It’s why we are already bouncing back from our first quarter slump with a 5.2% GDP increase in quarter two. We can deliver even more growth and greater opportunity in the days ahead.
The Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry is dedicated to doing just that. I’m grateful to have joined this historic organization at a time when its vision-led, data-driven, Nebraska-grown approach can help businesses achieve even bigger results.

Looking toward 2026, that means remaining a leader in the public policy arena. We will continue working closely with Gov. Jim Pillen, his team and every member of the Legislature to enact policies that make Nebraska the most pro-business state in the country.
One example? Manufacturing incentives. Right now, many states are getting rid of tools that attract manufacturers. Nebraska, instead of following that trend, should encourage new businesses to set up shop here. After all, not only do more employers create more Nebraska-based jobs, but they open more opportunities for partnerships.
Imagine how more innovative manufacturers can help farmers improve crop yields or give innovators quicker access to cutting-edge hardware.
Where solutions aren’t as obvious, the Nebraska Chamber will keep finding the best data to inform our plans. That includes crucial areas like childcare. Some 91 percent of Nebraska counties have insufficient resources to meet growing needs from families and working parents. The Nebraska State Chamber Foundation will soon release a report to help guide efforts to tackle this growing problem.
Finally, if there is one thing I’m most excited to help with, it’s telling the story of businesses. Maybe it’s cliché to say Nebraska feeds and fuels the world. But it’s true.
As one of the state’s most enthusiastic cheerleaders, we’re going to celebrate the incredible work our members, their workers and their partners are doing.
We’d love your help doing this. Like me, you probably won’t be walking onto the football team in Lincoln anytime soon. So instead, help us grow our state by shining light on the entrepreneurs and innovators who haven’t received the attention they deserve. I’m thrilled to be the newest recruit on a team with such enormous potential. And we have the talent, record and culture to win.
Todd Bingham is president and CEO of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Photo by Bryan P. Sears. A former Cecil County sheriff’s deputy pleaded guilty Wednesday to four counts of misconduct in office and three counts of unauthorized access to a computer after he searched a law enforcement database for information on seven people who were not suspects, including his wife.
According to the Maryland State Prosecutor’s office, Dontae Odom also searched information on romantic partners, a hotel employee in Ocean City and others. A statement of facts said Odom had no “legitimate law enforcement reason to search” a database about any of the individuals, who are not named.
Odom worked for sheriff’s office from 2019 until he resigned in August, conducted unauthorized searches from that year until part of 2025.
Odom illegally searched for information on his wife, identified as Victim 1, from March 13, 2024, to Jan. 4 of this year. He did searches on Victim 2 — a woman with whom he developed a romantic relationship after responding to a call at her house —  from April 1, 2022, through at least March 21, 2024. He also did searches on a relative of hers, identified as Victim 3, from May 18, 2022, through at least June 10, 2024.
Odoml later became romantically involved with Victim 4, who was married but separated from her husband, Victim 5.
On Sept. 13, 2024, Odom texted Victim 4 that he ad “looked her up.” She asked how he did that, saying she was, “Just making sure you didn’t look up my address in NCIC [National Crime Information Center].” Odom responded, “No, that[s] stalking and everything is tracked. I’m not getting fired for that.”
Besides searching the  database on that victim, Odom also searched for “Victim 5,” who was married to but separated from Victim 4.
When Odom and Victim 4 traveled to Ocean City in November 2024, Odom also searched for a hotel worker on the database.
One month later in December of that year, Victim 4 informed the sheriff’s office of Odom’s conduct.
Although Odom was served with a no-contact order, he continued to contact Victim 4 through social media, texts and emails. In addition, Odom secretly recorded a conversation in March of this year when they met at a secluded location, leading to a wiretapping charge.
On March 9 of this year, Odom repeatedly asked Victim 4 why she told investigators certain information. The next day, Odom texted her, “Why don’t you ask for the no contact order to be dropped” and “to delete everything.”
Odom also spoke with Victims 1 and 2 prior to and after they were interviewed by investigators.
The final individual, called “Victim 7,” worked in the same building as Odom in 2019. According to the state prosecutor, Odom searched for the number of Victim 7 in July 2024.
“When law enforcement officers break the very laws they are sworn to enforce, they violate the
public trust and undermine the integrity of our justice system,” Maryland State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III said in a statement. “Our office remains committed to thoroughly investigating — and when warranted, prosecuting — any instance where an officer may have misused their power and betrayed the public they are sworn to serve.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)There’s been an uptick in disordered gambling behaviors since Maryland legalized online sports betting, which problem gambling experts call a “concerning” trend that could worsen if newer modes of gambling become more available.
“Statewide Gambling Prevalence in Maryland: 2024” is the newest edition of legislatively mandated reporting on gambling trends over the years. But it’s the first report since legally available mobile sports betting became available in the state.
The survey of about 3,600 Marylanders was conducted from May to July 2024 and found that about 5.7% of those who responsed had exhibited disordered gambling behavior over the previous year. That’s an increase from findings in the previous edition of the report, in 2022, when just 4% of respondents  exhibited disordered gambling behavior.
The uptick in disordered gambling is “concerning” according to Jessica P. Brown, research director at the Maryland Center of Excellence on Problem Gambling at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, which created the report.
The report does not outright condemn the move to online sports betting, but Brown said that the center plans to “continue to track these patterns.”
According to the 2024 survey, nearly 90% of Marylanders have tried gambling at least once in their lives, which is largely consistent with previous survey years. A majority of respondents showed “low-risk” gambling behavior.
Disordered gambling is defined as “persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress.” It can often coincide with substance use disorders and have negative impacts on a person’s social and family life.
Industry study shows iGaming and bricks-and-mortar casinos can co-exist — and make money

The report finds that among those exhibiting disordered gambling, 66.2% were male. The report also said that people with disordered gambling behavior were “more likely than other Maryland adults to be Black or African American, have Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, have a high school diploma or less, and be unmarried.”
“Some of the sociodemographic groups affected most by disordered gambling behavior in Maryland are also marginalized with respect to economics, substance use, and access to health care,” the report says.
What’s new in the 2024 report is that more people have been using online sports betting platforms.
According to the 2024 survey responses, about 12% of respondents participated in online or mobile sports betting over the previous year– a jump up from the 3% who reported using online or mobile sports betting in 2022.
The 2022 study was conducted earlier in the year, when “sports gambling was available at casinos but not yet on mobile or online platforms” – though Marylanders may have participated through neighboring states or used offshore online sportsbooks.
Sports betting in general has also increased, with 17% of 2024 responses saying that they’ve placed bets on sports in the previous year — up from 14% from the 2022 responses.
“One major difference in the legal availability of gambling in the state … was the legalization of online sports betting,” Brown said Wednesday during a virtual discussion on the new data. “The current prevalence study … is the first study data that are available since that change.”
“Here we have the proportion of Maryland adults who have placed online sports bets … and it’s clear to see that this has grown considerably since the legal availability in late 2022,” she said.
The report found that almost 15% of Marylanders who had gambled on sports in the past year met criteria for “disordered gambling.”
While online sports betting has increased in recent years, the primary methods of gambling are still through lotteries and brick-and-mortar casinos.
The report did find an increase of people with disordered gambling habits reaching out for help and resources to curb their gambling. The report says that 13% of those with a history of disordered gambling have at some point sought help for their struggles, up from 7.5% in the 2022 report. But that still means most people with disordered gambling do not seek resources to help them.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The report says that more accessible gambling and the introduction of newer options such as iGaming could further shape the gambling environment.
“Over the coming years, recent modes of gambling (such as online/mobile sports gambling) may become more entrenched, and new modes (such as online casino-style iGaming) may become legally available,” the report says. “Future prevalence studies will track Marylanders’ gambling behavior and its outcomes in this changing landscape.”
During the annual legislative session, the Center of Excellence on Problem Gambling opposes bills that facilitate gambling habits, while supporting legislation that boosts awareness and resources for gambling addictions.
A fight that may reemerge in the upcoming session is a push to introduce iGaming in Maryland. Blair Inniss, the center’s government relations manager, said they plan to push back against any attempts to legalize it in the upcoming session.
“iGaming is generally defined in these bills as casino-style gambling through the internet,” she said. “A simpler way I like to describe it is ‘casinos on our cell phones.’”
“We already know that 24/7 online access to gambling is a public health concern,” Inniss said. “There are a variety of national and international studies that reiterate that people who gamble online are as much as eight times more likely to report compulsive gambling problems and addictive behavior than traditional brick-and-mortar casino players.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/betting-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 04:16:32.093217

(Photo/Chloe Broker)Sometimes I think the most “Florida” county of the 67, the one that best encapsulates the good and bad of the Sunshine State, is Wakulla County up in the Panhandle. It contains lots of wild natural beauty, and the politics can be equally wild.
Wakulla’s natural attributes include such beautiful places as St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge, the Apalachicola National Forest, and Wakulla Springs, which the state parks folks call “the world’s largest and deepest freshwater spring.” The water is so clear it was used for filming the underwater scenes of “Creature from the Black Lagoon.”
As for the politics, well, there are plenty of scary creatures lurking there too. The Tallahassee Democrat once described Wakulla County as a place “where political divisions run deep and conspiracy theories abound.”
The latest example of Wakulla politicians’ wobbly approach to the concept of “public service” involves the national forest. Wakulla County wants to swap some 200 acres with the Apalachicola National Forest and use the forest land to build a recreation area.
This is a deal that the county administrator says has been in the works since 2013. However, a lot of voters just found out about it last week and they’re howling mad. There’s now an online petition to stop it and a Facebook page called “Stop Bulldozing Apalachicola National Forest-Wakulla.”
Chloe Broker via subject)
One of the first posts on the Facebook page is from a local resident asking, “Why haven’t I heard about this? Nothing on the news?? Geez!!” The reply she received said, “That’s how they want it.”
“It’s been kept very quiet,” said community activist Chloe Broker, who’s been working to get the word out. “There’s no need to plow down this beautiful forest land and ruin people’s peace and quiet.”
Low-key notice
The 630,000-acre Apalachicola National Forest dates to 1936. It was created by President Franklin Roosevelt, probably the most radical left Democrat to ever serve as chief executive. FDR gave us Social Security and other government safety net programs, defeated the original Nazis, and helped start the United Nations. All it got him was elected to four terms.
These days, if you click on the Apalachicola National Forest website, you get a message from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that blames “Radical Left Democrats” for shutting down the federal government — although, last I checked, the government is under the control of the GOP.
Nevertheless, there’s a low-key public notice on the website that spells out what has so many folks outraged: “Wakulla County has proposed a land exchange with the Apalachicola National Forest. The county proposes to exchange lands near Sopchoppy, FL adjacent to Lawhon Mill Road for forest service land located near Crawfordville, FL east of Revadee Spears Rd.”
But that’s all the info offered by the feds. They don’t even mention that one of those cities is best known as the home of the most magical celebration in the state, the Sopchoppy Worm-Gruntin’ Festival.
The only other helpful item on the website is a timeline. It says there will be a comment period sometime next month. The final decision is tentatively scheduled for next March.
A county document outlining its future infrastructure needs delivered a couple more details: the location of the land in Crawfordville and the fact that the county wants to build “a multi-sport recreational center” with “athletic fields, playgrounds, seating, restrooms and concession stands.” The goal of the land swap is to “reduce the cost of land acquisition.”
But no one has surveyed the forest property to see if it’s suitable for use as a rec center, Broker told me. She sent me pictures showing it contains sinkholes and cypress swamps galore, neither of which are considered good terrain for any sport except mudbogging.
The people who live near that part of the forest like it just the way it is, she told me.
Perhaps that’s why the folks in charge haven’t asked their opinion. Florida is supposed to be the state with Government in the Sunshine, but these days a lot of politicians hide in the shade.
Why say whoa
I tried calling the forest service folks but, of course, I couldn’t reach them. They’re all twiddling their thumbs at home and waiting for our do-nothing Congress to reopen the government.
Chuck Hess via Wakulla County
Instead, I talked to a couple of former forest service employees. One, Chuck Hess, is a former red cockaded woodpecker biologist who spent eight years as a Wakulla County commissioner.
“It’s a bad idea,” he said of the land swap.
For the forest service, the land swap provides control of a piece of property that probably should have been a part of the forest already. Adding it to the federal holdings should make it easier to do controlled burns, which are essential to the health of the forest, he said.
There’s one problem: The county’s property has buildings on it that can’t be burned. They’re part of the Wakulla County Equestrian Center, which is under a covenant that says it cannot be torn down or moved, Hess pointed out.
“They have promised to keep that horse facility in place,” he explained. If the forest service can’t burn the property regularly the way it needs, he said, “I can’t see the benefit to the forest service.”
You could say the equestrian center is a good reason to tell the county, “Whoa!”

Forest forever
I had an even longer conversation with another former national forest employee, Eugene Watkins, who says he’s lived in Wakulla County for more than 40 years. He offered a couple of sharp observations about the land swap.
“I think the land swap is mainly for Wakulla to get land without paying for land,” he said.
Looking strictly at what the land is worth, the county is getting a lot more than it’s giving away.
“The value of the land that [the county] is giving up is less than the value of the land that they’re getting,” Watkins told me.
But as Broker pointed out, it’s just not the kind of land where you can build ballfields and playgrounds without a lot of expensive major alterations, he said.
Watkins told me he lives about a mile away from where the county wants to build its new rec center. He understands why the people living even closer aren’t happy about trading in the peace and quiet of the forest for the hubbub of ballfields and playgrounds.
“When people moved in there, they were told it would be a national forest forever,” he told me. “But now they’ll have to cope with lots of traffic and bright ballfield lights shining into their backyards.”

Sprawl over all, y’all
Saying that Wakulla County’s commissioners like development is like saying Popeye wouldn’t mind a bite of spinach. They’re absolutely besotted with big-money developers, and the heck with any consequences to the residents
Two years ago, for instance, a citizens’ group proposed a springs protection ordinance because lots of people were worried about the future of Wakulla Springs, which is both a huge tourist attraction and the source of the community’s drinking water. The commissioners didn’t even want to discuss it for fear it would slow the county’s growth.
Such a devotion to sprawl-over-all has taken a toll on the county and its longtime residents. At a commission meeting Monday night, several people complained about how the place has changed so radically they barely recognize it.

“The rate of growth in this county is ridiculous,” longtime Crawfordville resident Chad Smith told commissioners. “Our roads are falling apart, and our schools are jam-packed. This used to be my home, but this don’t feel like my home no more.”
The meeting room was absolutely packed, Broker told me. Lots of residents were ready to get up and raise sand about the proposed land swap.
Two things stopped them.
First, the commissioners got a report from a pair of consultants about the county’s poorly organized, badly maintained, and sorely understaffed recreation program. The consultants made it clear that the county’s current rec center has plenty of room for additional ballfields and other facilities, and that the local schools have land available too.
In other words, there’s no need to acquire any land from the national forest to build a new rec center.

Then came the second thing. After complaining about all the “hoopla” online about the proposed land swap, Commission Chairman Fred Nichols, a former cop, in effect said he’d like to put the whole idea under arrest.
“I wouldn’t feel comfortable putting a recreational park there,” he said of the national forest property. Then he went even further and said, “I’m not for messing with any U.S. Forest Service land.”
But then the commission’s vice chair, mortgage broker Ralph Thomas, piped up to say there was no formal land-swap proposal in front of the commission anyway. He insisted the opponents had “ginned up” the controversy and he had no clear idea what was being proposed.
That’s when a Florida Trident reporter named Michelle DeMarco who lives in Crawfordville stepped to the microphone. She reminded Thomas that she had emailed him about the land-swap when she first heard about it last year.
DeMarco compared the public’s anger over Wakulla’s proposed land-swap to the furor that erupted statewide last year when everyone found out Gov. Ron DeSantis was trying to sneak a trio of golf courses into a state park.
The Legislature wound up forbidding any governor to ever again try something so stupid. DeMarco pointed out how similarly unpopular the land swap had become.
“The people here don’t want this,” she told commissioners. They adjourned shortly afterward.
The way to win
Everyone I talked to attributed the push for this land swap to the longtime Wakulla County administrator, David Edwards.
Edwards, who was hired in 2011 despite having no experience in county management, has had a somewhat checkered history with the state Ethics Commission. That’s because of his tendency to accept gifts from county vendors and contractors.
He didn’t respond to my efforts to contact him for comment. But several people told me that Edwards has said in public that the land swap is an idea that’s been kicking around among county insiders since 2013. Hess confirmed that.
When I asked Hess why the swap was suddenly such a strong possibility now, he told me the reason was simple: “Because the current administration doesn’t really care about public lands.”
The minute he said it, I saw he was right.
Just last month, a Florida Phoenix affiliate reported that the president who’s even now ripping up the White House is “moving forward with a plan to open more than 58 million acres of previously protected national forests to development.”
Our frequently math-challenged chief executive is also proposing mass layoffs and firings of thousands of employees working in the federal agencies in charge of maintaining public lands.
This destruction of the public’s holdings is all part of the Project 2025 playbook that as a candidate he claimed was too extreme. Since he was sworn in, though, he’s been following it like it was written on stone tablets and handed to Moses on Mount Sinai.
The Heritage Foundation think tank’s blueprint calls for boosting timber sales in the national forests, not greater preservation or maintaining their peace and quiet.
Yet the people of Wakulla County clearly value the forest just the way it is. I think if they want to convince more than one commissioner to listen to them, they need to ramp up their opposition.
My suggestion would be for the opponents to challenge the five commissioners to a softball game at the county’s poorly maintained rec center. The winners get to decide what happens with the land swap, and the losers have to fix the existing rec center.
To ensure the right outcome, though, maybe the opponents should hide some of those Sopchoppy worms in the commissioners’ uniforms. Otherwise, they might try to wiggle out of it.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland will become one of the first states in the nation to distribute “tap and go” EBT, or electronic benefit transfer, cards to state residents, giving almost 1 million Marylanders secure access to their cash and food benefits.
It could be months before the cards are fully available, under a multiyear contract for Fidelity Information Systems approved Wednesday by the Board of Public Works. But Department of Human Services officials were already welcoming the new contract, which they hope will reverse a rising number of benefit thefts from recipients.
“This contract will make benefits access seamless and safer for the 943,000 Marylanders we serve through EBT, including 680,000 Marylanders who receive SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits,” Human Services Secretary Rafael López said in a prepared statement.
Wednesday’s award ends more than a year of legal wrangling between the state and the two companies bidding on the project, and implementation of the chip-enabled cards cannot come soon enough for Comptroller Brooke Lierman, one of three members of the Board of Public Works.
“We are losing state resources and people are losing their funds every day, and I want this to move as quickly as possible to get those chip cards deployed,” Lierman said at Wednesday’s board meeting.
State approves early buyouts for 332 employees, part of the elimination of 502 state jobs

The contract to Fidelity could be worth as much as $38.4 million over 10 years, for the company to provide chip-enabled EBT cards to about 943,000 recipients of SNAP, of  Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA) and the Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP). About 680,000 Maryland citizens got an average of $180 per month in SNAP benefits in fiscal 2025, according to a DHS press release.
The new, chip-enabled cards are expected to help reduce “benefit theft,” the DHS statement said, a statement reinforced by DHS Chief of Staff Webster Ye at Wednesday’s board meeting.
“In this incredibly tight budget landscape, we want to maximize every Maryland state taxpayer dollar and minimize our replacement of stolen federal benefits,” Ye told the board.
The implementation of “tap and go” technology in EBT cards is making the system “easier and more secure,” acting as the state’s method of protection from fraud and benefit theft, the DHS statement said. Fidelity plans to incorporate Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV), which uses chip cards to allow users to wave or tap their cards when making a payment, according to board documents.
Maryland will become one of the first states to use both contact and “tap and go” EBT cards, if successful. Currently, California is the only state using this technology for EBT services.
Fidelity worked with California to successfully deploy 4 million chip cards earlier this year, and saw “substantially decreased stolen EBT benefits,” Ye said.
That experience helped give Fidelity the edge over the other major bidder on the Maryland contract, Conduent State and Local Solutions, and may bring a close to a yearlong fight between the two companies.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Conduent had the contract as EBT provider for Maryland and it won the contract again last year over Fidelity, when DHS put the project out to bid.
But Fidelity challenged the award before the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals, which ruled on Aug. 30, 2024, that Conduent’s proposal was  “not reasonably susceptible for being selected” due to conditional language — making the Conduent contract void. The contract appeal board’s ruling was upheld on March 31, 2025, by a Baltimore Ciry Circuit Court judge.
That ruling has been appealed by Conduent to the Appellate Court of Maryland, but DHS dropped its legal challenges at that point and accepted Fidelity as the winning bidder.
“We acknowledge our mistake, and as a result, we have chosen not to file an appeal of the Circuit Court’s decision,” Ye said, acknowledging that the department did not properly follow the procurement review process.
In response, Lierman joked, “I told you so.”
While it may have lost its bid on the next contract, Conduent holds the current contract, which runs through June 30, 2026. The Fidelity contract begins on July 1, 2026, but Wednesday’s award includes $7.7 million for Fidelity to “transition in” over the next nine months and the ground running next summer.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC_0046-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-23 04:16:32.093217

Brown/Maryland Matters0A legislative panel on Wednesday signaled an interest in making changes to dozens of professional oversight boards housed within the Maryland Department of Health, after complaining of a lack of accountability and repeat findings on the boards by auditors.
Members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee noted that some findings by their audit team go back decades. Legislative Auditor Brian S. Tanen said the findings, published in April, point to a lack of accountability when it comes to boards rectifying deficiencies found in previous audits.
In two cases, the findings were more than 20 years old.
“One board implements, another one doesn’t. It becomes challenging, because each one of them are sort of responsible for setting up their own controls in each of the areas that are put in this report,” Tanen said. “Sometimes they get together … and address some of the controls or some of the processes.”
Tanen said there is “no one single person” who is responsible or accountable for the plethora of findings “which is both challenging on our end and importantly for the department in implementing the recommendations.”
The majority of the boards are technically independent. Even though they are housed within the state health department, the agency and its leaders have little to no oversight role.

Tanen’s office issued a report in April detailing problems within 20 different boards and commissions that oversee and license health care facilities and practitioners including nurses, pharmacists, dentists and others.
Among the findings of the report, which covered the period from September 2019 to July 2023, was that the agencies often failed to investigate complaints against licensees in a timely manner — a problem the auditors said could be due to staffing shortages during that period.
“There are some that do run well, and there are many that do not,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), the co-chair of the joint audit committee. “I think it is worth taking a deep dive to figure out where those holes are because we’ve had a history of there being so many problems. Look at the Board of Nursing. We don’t want other boards to hit bottom before we actually put in a system.”
The report said that the 20 boards and commissions it studied had a total of 4,916 open cases as of February 2024, but that 3,051 of those had been open for more than two years. The Board of Nursing, the largest by far of all the boards, had 2,411 cases that had been open for more than two years, it said.
Included in the list of findings was a patchwork of policies regarding criminal background checks for professionals seeking state licensure.
Auditors found six boards that do not require any criminal background checks to obtain a license. Ten others do not get alerts on criminal activity involving licensees.
Auditors matched individuals licensed by the pharmacy and dental examiners boards with criminal conviction records. They found 16 licensed dental professionals and 14 licensed pharmacy professionals who had been convicted of a crime.
Two of the dental professionals were convicted of assault which should have triggered a one-year suspension of their licenses, auditors said.
Hettleman and Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), House co-chair of the committee,  said they were immediately concerned with having a consistent policy on criminal background checks.

“The board of pharmacy — you’re not doing background checks on pharmacists? I mean, come on,” Hettleman said. “That needs to happen.”
Auditors also raised concerns about the Board of Nursing.
A 2023 federal investigation into fraudulent nursing credentials found 287 people who may have used a scheme to obtain a license in Maryland. Auditors said the board could not document that it had investigated 259 of those individuals, 131 of whom were working in Maryland facilities. Six of those worked in state-run facilities.
The audit also found that roughly 3,600 of 4,900 licensing complaints to various boards remained open for two years. One allegation of sexual abuse received by the Board of Nursing in December 2021 had not been investigated as of February 2024.
Auditors also identified issues common to a lot of boards related to handling payments and other functions that are duplicated across all the boards. Tanen suggested the boards might benefit from “efficiencies” that come from centralizing some of those duties.
“We could look within the state, and the model that the Department of Labor has for their occupational professional licensing,” Tanen said.
Members of the committee seem keen on exploring that idea.
“At the end of the day in a time when we’re making government work better for the state, for our residents, for the practitioners, we have to figure out how we get the inefficiencies solved to make these systems work better, to make everybody’s life easier,” Solomon said.
“Some of this is efficiency and again, figuring out where those holes are to (Hettleman’s) point and how we can, we can fix those and patch them, but also some system of accountability,” Solomon said.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), a licensed physician, agreed with the need for reform but said the effort was too large to undertake without a more formal review.

“I’m thinking potentially we may have to have a study done, or as you saw, there was one of the boards that had an outside consultant brought in to do a complete look-over and give us recommendations,” Lam said.
Initially, Lam and other lawmakers said they believed that review was being conducted by former Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott.
Scott left earlier this year. Health department officials were unable to provide an update on the review or if it was mothballed since Scott’s departure.
“I thought that’s what the secretary was doing before she left, but now it looks like it didn’t go anywhere, or the knowledge wasn’t handed off to someone else,” Lam said.
“And so here we are, but I think we may need someone to be dedicated to this effort,” he said. “This is complicated. There’s a lot of health occupations. How do we come up with a good plan and structure? Sounds like a good consulting project to do? That’s what management consultants do.”

Our health center operates three sites in northwest Connecticut, as well as school-based health centers throughout our region and a mobile van. We deliver primary care close to where people are. 
But we face challenges, as do other community health centers in Connecticut. We struggle to recruit and retain health care providers, sometimes causing patients to experience long wait times for an appointment. Families juggling work, childcare, and transportation challenges face even greater barriers, leading to missed preventive care, worsening chronic conditions, and increasing unnecessary trips to the emergency room. These gaps are not isolated; they reflect the ongoing issues our community health centers and other health providers face each day as we aim to keep care accessible.
This is why Connecticut must seize the opportunity created by the new Rural Health Transformation Grant (RHTG) program and bolster Community Health Centers.
This summer, Congress passed this historic $50 billion federal investment as part of HR 1, to help health systems prepare for the sweeping changes to Medicaid coming in 2027. The goal is to prepare rural providers for the loss of coverage expected when millions of Americans are eventually removed from Medicaid rolls. Under the RHTG, each of the 50 states, including Connecticut, is poised to receive at least $100 million per year for five years through this program. If deployed wisely, these funds could strengthen all 17 of our community health centers  – a smart investment in the health of all Connecticut residents.
Together Connecticut’s community health centers provide care for 452,000 residents, including more than 262,000 HUSKY patients. While only parts of northwestern and northeastern Connecticut are technically defined as “rural,” the federal law and the RHTG application process specify that all community health centers qualify as rural providers under this grant. This recognition reflects the reality that Connecticut’s 17 community health centers serve underserved and low-income populations, regardless of geographic designation.
Connecticut’s community health centers are essential because they provide quality care close to the patient, reduce pressure on hospitals, increase access to primary and preventive care, and provide critical health services. As a result, they are a significant provider in the state’s Medicaid program, serving almost 30% of Connecticut’s one million Medicaid patients.
Connecticut’s Department of Social Services (DSS) is developing the state’s application for the RHTG funds. We urge the department to ensure that all of Connecticut’s community health centers are fully included in the state’s funding strategy. We recommend that Connecticut direct RHTG resources toward two critical areas: strengthening the health care workforce and investing in telehealth and health technology.
Workforce initiatives are critical to address the persistent barriers rural residents face in accessing care. A shortage of primary care providers, combined with significant travel distances and limited public transportation, make it difficult for rural residents to achieve optimal health. 
To combat this, we recommend expanding proven workforce models such as the Teaching Health Center  program. Connecticut’s only teaching health center, located in Danbury, has successfully retained primary care providers in the state, with 84% of graduates continuing to serve in primary care and underserved settings. We recommend creating at least one more teaching health center in Connecticut. We also recommend implementing structured transition-to-practice programs for new providers like APRNs and physician assistants, creating health career pipelines for high school students, and strengthening financial incentives like student loan repayment and tax relief. These efforts are essential to recruit and retain a sustainable healthcare workforce in rural areas and across Connecticut.
Equally important are investments in telehealth and health technology, which offer cost-effective solutions to expand access and improve outcomes. 
For example, telehealth visits improve convenience, privacy, and continuity of care, while reducing barriers such as travel time and provider shortages. E-consults are an existing model that allow primary care providers to access specialist expertise without requiring their patients to wait for in-person specialist visits, saving the state millions and delivering care faster. But the state currently does not allow community health centers to receive reimbursement for e-Consults. 
Remote patient monitoring  supports patients with chronic conditions like heart failure, asthma, and high-risk pregnancies, enhancing self-management and communication. To maximize innovations like telehealth, e-consults, and remote monitoring, Community Health & Wellness and other community health centers require upgraded broadband infrastructure and tech equipment for both providers and patients. With the RHTG funds, Connecticut has a critical opportunity to modernize its rural health infrastructure. Community health centers stand ready to lead the way.
As the state prepares its application for this unprecedented federal investment, Connecticut has a vital opportunity to strengthen the backbone of its rural health infrastructure by directing RHTG funds where they will have the greatest impact, into the workforce and technology that power community health centers. 
Health centers have a long and proven track record of delivering high-quality, cost-effective care to those who need it most. Additional investment in workforce and technology will ensure that these essential providers are equipped to meet the growing needs of their communities. 
We urge the Department of Social Services to fully include all community health centers in its RHTG strategy and to seize this moment to build a more resilient, accessible system that reduces barriers to care and optimizes the health and wellness of all of Connecticut’s residents.

According to CBS News reports, Prospect Medical’s CEO Sam Lee took home about $90 million while the shareholders in the investment group that owns Prospect Medical Holdings; Leonard Green were paid $257 million. Connecticut is now scrambling in bankruptcy court to recover what it can from a company that systematically drained resources from our healthcare system while making millions in profits for their investors. 
The financial collapse exposed the lack of accountability by health care administrators, Connecticut State Bill SB-7 could have addressed this issue, however it failed to pass.
At Waterbury Hospital, staff have reported deteriorating infrastructure, outdated equipment, and safety hazards that compromise patient care. Waterbury Hospital, owned by Prospect Medical Holdings was hit by a cyber-attack last summer and their hospital was in chaos. The Emergency Department was required to divert patients, necessary surgeries were postponed or cancelled and staff struggled to manage care with paper records. 
The financial struggles and security breach revealed a deeper problem; a for-profit healthcare system with administrative leadership that lacked preparedness, coordination, and accountability.  This crisis underscores why legislative reform like SB-7 is urgently needed
When leadership fails, it’s not just a business issue,  it’s a public health emergency. If a nurse or physician made a decision that harmed a patient, their professional license would be reviewed, and possibly revoked. Under current law, the administrators making these decisions; those responsible for staffing, budgeting, emergency preparedness, and facility maintenance are not required to hold a license in Connecticut. Senate Bill 7 changes that.
Even U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, has spoken out forcefully against the damage caused by Prospect Medical Holdings. Murphy strongly criticized Prospect Medical’s practices, stating the company prioritized investor profit at the expense of patient care and community benefit. In a roundtable Senate hearing, he called Prospects management of Connecticut hospitals “an abomination” and accused them of running facilities “into the ground.”
Prospect Medical’s bankruptcy may be the most high-profile case of hospital mismanagement in Connecticut, but it is far from the only one. According to a recent article in the Hartford Courant, recent violations at Trinity Health-owned Saint Francis Hospital where the state Department of Public Health cited two “immediate jeopardy” situations, highlight that even established hospitals are failing to put patients first. 
The nurses at Saint Francis Hospital in Hartford faced a different crisis from Waterbury Hospital — chronic understaffing. Nurses report unsafe patient loads, long wait times, and burnout. According to Department of Public Health reports, the Emergency Department was staffed with eight nurses when their census required 21 nurses. These are not isolated incidents. They’re symptoms of a system where those in charge of staffing, budgeting, and emergency planning are not required to meet any formal standards.
Connecticut’s Senate Bill 7 offered a solution. It would require health care administrators to be licensed, similar to the clinicians they supervise. This bill would require passing a state licensure exam, holding a relevant degree in healthcare, and demonstrating knowledge of health care law, ethics, and emergency protocols by attending formal training. Licensure would hold decision-makers accountable. Administrators make decisions that shape patient care, safety and hospital longevity. However with todays laws, they can do so without any formal credentialing. Senate Bill 7 would have changed that and  would give the Department of Public Health the authority to investigate misconduct and revoke licenses when necessary.
Connecticut needs healthcare administrators who are trained, tested, licensed and held accountable. As a registered nurse I would never be allowed to care for patients without training and licensure and I believe health care administrators should be held to the same standards. Patients should be placed over profits. Senate Bill SB-7 would ensure that those managing our health care institutions meet the same professional standards we expect from those delivering care.
Senate Bill 7 was introduced in early 2025 to require licensure for healthcare administrators, but it ultimately stalled in the legislature and was not passed. The conversation should not end here. It is a critical time for the public to speak up and contact their local lawmakers. Ask them to revisit and reintroduce this bill in the next legislative session and support stronger accountability for the administrators that make decisions for Connecticut hospitals as we cannot afford to let this opportunity slip away and jeopardize our other healthcare facilities. 
Our health care workforce, our patients, and our communities deserve better. It’s time to hold administrators accountable and ensure that the people making the most critical decisions in our hospitals are trained, licensed, and acting in the public’s best interest, not solely protecting their profits.

(File photo by Bruce DePuyt/Maruyland Matters)More than 500 state jobs were abolished Wednesday by the Board of Public Works through a combination of elimination of vacant positions and the departure of hundreds of workers who took an early buyout.
All told, the elimination of 502 positions is expected to save $27.4 million in fiscal 2026, said Marc Nicole, the deputy secretary of the Department of Budget and Management, who presented the cuts to the board. He said the eliminated jobs are expected to save $47.2 million in fiscal 2027 and in years going forward.
Nicole said 170 abolished jobs were vacant positions that were deemed unneeded and were eliminated, but the other 332 were state employees who took an early buyout under the Voluntary Separation Program unveiled this summer as part 0f the state’s budget-cutting efforts.
The buyout program was available to full-time state workers with at least two years of state service.  Not everyone who applied was accepted and some workers were not even allowed to apply, including police, correctional workers, court employees and close to 60 other state offices, according to the buyout offer.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state received a total of 877 valid applications from state workers by the Aug. 4 deadline. State officials said at the outset of the process that they did not have a specific target in mind for the number of early buyouts, by the 332 approved for a buyout year was almost identical to the last round of early outs, in 2015, when 38% of those who applied were accepted.
Those whose separation applications were approved got $20,000, plus an additional $300 for each year of service and six months of their health benefits paid for by the state. They were also paid for any unused leave or compensatory time.
Workers had to agree not to work for the state again for at least 18 months, and their positions were eliminated once they left. The last day for those accepted for early separation was Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 2025.
The eliminated jobs are just a fraction of the nearly 52,000 positions within the state personnel and state Transportation Department personnel systems that were reported this spring by the Department of Budget and Management. But Gov. Wes Moore (D) said the cuts are needed to help the state deal  with torrent of cuts being made to federal jobs and agencies by President Donald Trump (R) and his administration.
“Maryland has never been tested like this before,” Moore said. “We have policies that are coming from the White House that are doing everything from raising prices to pulling away basic supports and basic services — and all this is happening at a time when we continue to manage a historic budget crisis that the state of Maryland is navigating.”

Joe Lombardo said in a press statement issued by his office Friday afternoon.
The press release was accompanied by a letter from Lombardo to Nevada Democratic U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen, calling on her to “work with your colleagues to reopen the federal government.”
“I’m confident that through cooperation and goodwill, we can restore stability and move forward together,” said Lombardo’s letter.
A few minutes after Lombardo’s statement and letter were issued to the press, Rosen responded with a statement of her own.
“I want this government shutdown to end,” Rosen said, “which is why I urge Governor Lombardo to push Donald Trump and his own party in Washington to work in a bipartisan way to reopen the government and prevent a massive spike in health care costs for Nevadans.”
Lombardo’s letter also praised Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, one of only two Democratic senators, along with one independent who caucuses with the Democrats, who have been voting for a Republican stopgap spending bill that would end the shutdown.
Rosen, like the overwhelming majority of Cortez Masto’s Democratic colleagues in both the Senate and the U.S. House, voted against the Republican spending bill because it failed to restore Affordable Care Act subsidies that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration curtailed earlier this year. Health insurance premiums are projected to increase substantially if the Republican action is not reversed.
Democrats have repeatedly called on Republicans to meet with them to negotiate over the insurance issue, but Republican congressional leaders, taking their cue from Trump, have refused unless Democrats pass the Republican funding bill first.
The Trump administration has established a pattern of acting unilaterally without congressional approval, and also of cancelling federal funding that had been approved by Congress, even though the Constitution specifies that Congress, not the executive branch, controls federal spending.
In a nod to the administration’s practices and trustworthiness, or lack thereof, earlier this month Rosen said it would be “naive” to trust Trump to negotiate if Democrats were to simply surrender in the shutdown standoff.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Image-6-5-24-at-3.38-PM-1024x575.jpeg,,,2025-10-22 21:56:36.100019

Trump said he also authorized an immediate $25 million in relief funding, to cover costs as the state continues to conduct damage assessments. 
“I am approving $25 Million Dollars to help Alaska recover from the major typhoon they experienced earlier this month,” Trump wrote on the social media site Truth Social. “It is my Honor to deliver for the Great State of Alaska, which I won BIG in 2016, 2020, and 2024 — ALASKA, I WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”
The Alaska congressional delegation also thanked the president in a joint statement, noting their letter urging the president to respond and grant the disaster declaration. 
“I raised Alaska’s disaster declaration directly with President Trump yesterday at the White House and thank him for quickly approving it to ensure impacted western communities have federal support in the wake of Typhoon Halong,” wrote US Sen. Lisa Senator Murkowski, R-Alaska. “I also appreciate FEMA’s expedited review of this request, which is one of the quickest federal responses in recent years.”
“To all Alaskans impacted,” Murkowski added. “Please know that your congressional delegation, state, and nation stand united and will continue to coordinate recovery efforts as you move forward.”
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, praised Trump’s move and said he would be visiting storm-impacted villages on Saturday.
“I plan on being in Western Alaska this weekend with top FEMA and DHS officials, and my team and I will continue working closely with the Trump administration and our state, local, and tribal partners to make sure these incredible Alaskans get the help they need to recover and return to their communities,” Sullivan said. 
Begich has not announced plans to visit the region. He also praised Trump and the announcement. “Our focus as a delegation remains on ensuring every Alaskan family impacted by this storm receives the resources and support needed throughout the long process of rebuilding their lives,” he said.

The disaster declaration request covered the Northwest Arctic Borough, Lower Yukon Regional Education Attendance Area and the Lower Kukokwim Regional Attendance Area, places hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.
More than 1,500 residents were displaced by the storm that killed one woman and left two missing in Kwigillingok.  
The storm recovery effort is in full swing. Local residents are working on clean up, while regional tribal partners and dozens of state agencies, non-profit and relief organizations provide support to the region, particularly the hardest hit area of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. State and tribal agencies are flying aid into those residents who remain in the coastal villages, like immediate food, water and fuel, while crews continue to work on debris removal, fuel spills, infrastructure assessment and repair to water, power, and sewer systems, roads and boardwalks. Crews are working throughout communities to repair homes where possible, so that local residents can return before winter sets in. 
There is no cost estimate for the storm damage at this time, according to Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, because agencies are working to restore services simultaneously. 
The state is offering emergency assistance, available through an application on the state’s website, open through November 9.
The program provides financial assistance for storm damage to homes, vehicles, essential personal property, medical, dental or funeral needs directly related to the disaster. Applicants will be eligible for $21,250 in home repairs and another $21,250 for “other needs.”
The president has not yet authorized federal individual assistance — $42,500 for home repairs and $42,500 for other items — but state officials say there will likely be more information from the Trump administration in the coming days.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/500h_q95.jpg,,,2025-10-22 21:56:36.100019

(Annie Knox/Utah News Dispatch) When food benefits run out next month, Rose Wakeham is worried about losing access to more than the fresh vegetables they love to cook.  
“I might have to quit school and get a different job,” said Wakeham, 28.
Wakeham’s grocery bills are covered by $200 in aid from federal nutrition benefits each month, while their part-time job at a store helps with other expenses. The idea of having to drop out of their first year of culinary school to work full time “makes me feel a bit hopeless,” Wakeham said Wednesday.
“I didn’t take the traditional route,” said Wakeham, of Salt Lake County. “I feel like I’m just now finding my path, and it’s like being blocked.”

Across Utah, about 87,000 households are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. None of them will receive those benefits in November as funding for the federal program lapses in the government shutdown, the state announced Wednesday. 
To administer the program, Utah’s Department of Workforce Services draws down an average of $33 million in federal funding each month, said spokesperson Christina Davis. She noted it’s possible SNAP payment cards will not work after Nov. 1, even if there’s money in the account. 
Wakeham plans to donate plasma for extra grocery money and turn to food pantries next month. 
“I’m stressed, definitely,” Wakeham said.  
In Salt Lake City, Crossroads Urban Center’s two pantries serve more than 13,000 people per month, with traffic spiking in the days before food program benefits come in, said Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director. 
The rising cost of living doesn’t help. Tibbitts noted rent has climbed along the Wasatch Front, shooting up by double digits in 2021, with some estimates around 20%. 
“The people we serve still haven’t recovered from that,” Tibbitts said. A pause in food assistance will further stretch many trying to make ends meet, he said. 
“If somebody can’t feed their kids at the beginning of next month, they’re going to be mad at everybody who could’ve done something to fix it,” Tibbitts said. “They’ll be mad at the president, they’ll be mad at everyone in Congress, too. They need to come together and figure out how to stop that from happening.”

In a statement to Utah News Dispatch, Utah Senate President Stuart Adams indicated the state won’t step in next month to cover the program. 
“The state is not equipped to fund federal programs for weeks or months in the absence of congressional action,” said Adams, R-Layton. “It is unacceptable for Congress to allow Utahns and Americans to bear the burden of inaction.” 
Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz urged Congress to end the shutdown to spare vulnerable Utahns harm, with Schultz faulting Democrats. 
“This situation is a stark reminder of how federal dysfunction can cascade down to the states and directly harm the most vulnerable among us,” said Schultz, R-Hooper.

Michael Thomson, 59, and Natalie Rhodes, 45, of Salt Lake City, were figuring out Wednesday how to stretch their budget to make up for next month’s gap in food assistance. 
“We’re going to take what we have left and we’re going to buy a bunch of ramen noodle soup and a loaf of bread and maybe a thing of peanut butter, and see how far that’ll take us,” Rhodes said.  “There’s not much we can do about it.” 
Thomson called the impact “devastating,” but said believes it’s largely lost on those in power. 
The couple said they are homeless and have used the program to eat healthy and buy fresh fruit even though they do not have a place to cook their own meals. 
Rhodes said the word that comes to mind after the state’s announcement on Wednesday is “hopeless,” especially for moms of young children.  
The Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, or WIC, is still running, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday. 
For those who receive WIC assistance in addition to SNAP benefits, the pause “can have a significant impact,” affecting families’ ability to afford groceries, the department said.

Emmett Reistroffer, of Genesis Farms in Sioux Falls, spoke during the public comment session at the end of the meeting.
“My phone has been blowing up with text messages,” he said. “There’s kind of a shockwave going through our community right now, with the speakers that were invited, most of whom were out-of-state.” 
Reistroffer also said he fears the committee is involved in a coordinated effort to restrict or repeal the state’s medical marijuana program, which voters approved in 2020 and the state implemented in 2022. There are currently 16,477 patient cards issued in the state.
Reistroffer’s comments resulted in the chairwoman of the Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee, Rep. Josephine Garcia, R-Watertown, cutting him off.
“There has been no intention at all for any agenda this meeting, other than to follow what was not done when this program was first rolled out,” Garcia said. “That was my only intention here. If you’re insinuating that me, as the chair, have said something or orchestrated something, I have not done that. It is awareness for the public. This is a public safety issue.”

The panel of speakers included medical professionals and retired law enforcement officers from other states who shared concerns about over-prescription, youth access, mental health impacts, and a blurring between medical and recreational use. 
Ed Moses, a retired law enforcement officer from Missouri, talked about various dangers of marijuana. He alleged medical marijuana is a “Trojan horse” for recreational marijuana. 
“Marijuana can change who we are and our values,” he told the committee. 
Karen Randall, an emergency medicine physician from Colorado, said she sees adults and children come into the emergency room due to marijuana-related incidents. She told a story about a child getting a highly potent marijuana candy product from the back of a dispensary without any identification, and ending up in the emergency room.
Randall said Colorado has become overloaded with various marijuana products, and it’s now the drug of choice for kids there.  
“They’re not drinking, they’re not smoking like they used to — they’re using marijuana,” she said.

University of Oklahoma professor John Duncan, who works in the College of Medicine, advised the committee to treat medical marijuana like traditional medications, including prescribed dosing. He also said the committee should watch out for synthetic forms of marijuana that come with a host of other side effects. 
Colorado addiction psychiatrist Libby Stuyt told the committee that medical marijuana is not the post-traumatic stress disorder solution that medical marijuana proponents allege. She said patients who are prescribed medical marijuana for mental health disorders often mistake the feeling of withdrawal for needing more medicine — blurring treatment and addiction. 
Wednesday’s lineup also included Sioux Falls Superintendent James Nold. He said marijuana has become a problem in schools, with students accessing products through adults. 
Jeremiah Murphy, who lobbies for the medical marijuana industry, told committee members during the public comment period that they should take pride in the state’s program.  
“If you think about what you heard today, they hardly landed a punch on the South Dakota program,” he said. “They showed you real, significant problems in Oklahoma.”
Reistroffer said the medical marijuana industry is taking heat for local “smoke shops” selling illegal products, including those with hemp-derived but chemically modified ingredients. He said they are the ones selling high-dose “candy bars” and products that attract kids. 
“We are not, yet we are getting painted with their brush,” he said.
The committee made no formal recommendations and took no votes during the meeting.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners advanced 18 proposals at its final meeting on Wednesday in Pierre, setting up a potentially long list of bills for legislators to consider this winter.
The proposals include cutting state spending and applying the savings to property tax relief, replacing some property tax revenue with sales tax increases, using one-time tax credits for temporary taxpayer relief, and reserving a portion of future state revenue increases each year to reduce property taxes. Other recommendations include further restricting development incentives known as tax increment financing districts and requiring local public votes on school district decisions to raise taxes beyond state-imposed limits.
Lawmakers on the task force expressed a hope in June to propose legislation that will cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes by at least 50%. South Dakota property taxes paid by homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
The task force started Wednesday with 26 potential recommendations resulting from earlier meetings, which were reduced to 18 that will likely be introduced as legislation this winter by task force members. 
South Dakota Retailers Association Executive Director Nathan Sanderson told task force members that the lengthy list points to a repeat of last winter’s legislative session, when more than 30 property tax proposals competed and only one, spearheaded by the governor, was signed into law. That law includes a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments, plus other provisions such as expanded eligibility for an assessment freeze program for elderly and disabled people.

“We’re not really driving toward any kind of consensus here,” Sanderson said. “We’re throwing a lot of things out there to kind of see what sticks, so I’m sure we’re going to be talking about this in March 2026 similar to the same way that we’re talking about it today.”
March is the final month of the legislative session, which begins in January.
Sanderson criticized a few ideas for their potentially negative impact on small businesses and South Dakota residents, adding that cuts to state government would be “incredibly difficult” to do without specific proposals.
He encouraged lawmakers to support a return of South Dakota’s state sales tax rate from 4.2% to 4.5% (the Legislature reduced the rate in 2023), dedicating the increase in revenue to property tax relief, which was proposed by Spearfish Republican Sen. Randy Deibert and forwarded by the task force. Sanderson estimated that the “relatively simple” solution would amount to $105 million of available relief for property taxpayers.
The few proposals that didn’t pass muster by the task force included removing some sales tax exemptions, such as exemptions on advertising, and an increase in sales taxes beyond a return to 4.5%. Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre — who’s not on the task force — submitted a column to the media the day before the meeting supporting a failed proposal from last winter to increase the sales tax rate to 5%, and use the extra revenue to reduce property taxes by an estimated 35% for homeowners.
Gov. Larry Rhoden has proposed an optional, half-percent sales tax for counties to replace a portion or all of their property taxes on owner-occupied homes. That proposal was not considered by the task force but could still end up as legislation introduced at the governor’s request. The task force also omitted consideration of a transaction tax proposed by former lawmaker Julie Frye-Mueller earlier this summer, which could appear as a citizen-initiated ballot question in 2026 and would be applied in addition to existing sales taxes.

This story by Robert F. Smith was first published in The Commons on Oct. 21, 2025.

ROCKINGHAM — Over the past couple of weeks, several important projects in Rockingham have taken significant steps forward. At the same time, the federal government shutdown, combined with ongoing massive cuts in federal funding and staffing, have added elements of uncertainty to the process for some of the work.
The federal chaos has led to many questions on what approved federal grants will be fully funded and when or if the money will be received.
But locally, on Oct. 14, two bond votes — one for major preservation work on the historic Rockingham Meeting House, and the other for funding a new roof on the Town Hall — were both overwhelmingly approved by voters.
In addition, Rockingham for Progress Inc., which is restoring the dormant Miss Bellows Falls Diner, received a major state tax credit award. And the long-anticipated restoration work on the village train depot also began last week.
These projects involve preserving and maintaining four of the most historically significant structures in the town. Over the past several years, both town officials and volunteer citizen groups have been instrumental in moving these projects forward.
Town Manager Scott Pickup said he was pleased with the bond votes, as well as the progress on the train station and the Meeting House. Preserving and maintaining the town’s historic structures are both “our responsibility and our obligation,” Pickup said.
He added that citizens have been giving their time, skills and monetary donations, all of which have been necessary in moving these projects along. “A lot of this work is grant funded,” Pickup said, “and the community has been very supportive.” This is particularly true of the restoration of the Miss Bellows Falls Diner, he noted.
“We need the grants,” to get these projects done, he said. “Unfortunately, at the moment politics has frozen a lot of the funding.”
The Town Hall and Meeting House
One of the most urgent projects facing the town is the replacement of the roof on the Town Hall, which houses the administrative offices, a 553-seat theater and performance space and other venues in constant use.
“The roof leaks horribly,” Pickup said, and the water has damaged the plaster in several offices and threatened the camera equipment in the movie theater’s projection room. The Town Hall will celebrate its centennial in 2026, and Pickup said that the roof has been “sealed several times,” but is failing and now needs to be replaced.
“We have a contractor, and the materials have been ordered,” Pickup said. “We hope to start this next week. I would really like to see this done before Thanksgiving.”
The total cost for the project is $680,000, covered by a $160,000 state grant. The $525,000 balance is covered by the local 30-year bond. 
The Rockingham Meeting House is considered an architectural gem of the community. Built from 1787 to 1801, it was used for decades for meetings by church, community, and government alike. Neglected for some time, it was restored in 1906, and preservation efforts have continued since then.
Owned by the town, the Meeting House was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. government in 2000 and is considered one of the oldest and best-preserved buildings of its type in the nation. The Meeting House bond article for $125,000 was approved with the Oct. 14 vote. The funds will serve as the local match for two large National Park Service Saving America’s Treasures federal grants that the town has already received toward the project, estimated at nearly $3 million.
“We’ve started the bidding process for work to begin in spring 2026,” said Walter Wallace, the coordinator of the Rockingham Historic Preservation Commission. Preservation includes maintenance on the slate roof, foundation work, plaster and exterior woodwork conservation and restoration of interior details such as the box pews.
Wallace said that an open house with a detailed report to the community about the project is being organized at the Meeting House for Saturday, Nov. 1, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., with a formal discussion scheduled to start at 11 a.m.
Voters originally approved both bonds earlier in the year by voice vote. The town was advised by its attorney that the bonds had to be approved by Australian ballot, necessitating the October balloting. Of 3,800 registered voters, 171 cast ballots, with the outcome mirroring the earlier decisions. The bond for the Meeting House was approved 135–35, and the one for the Town Hall roof, 138–33.
Work begins on the train depot
The $3.3 million train depot restoration project began last week, starting with a focus on environmental hazard remediation. Pickup said that three firms have been contracted for the initial environmental work.
A vapor barrier in the basement of the building will seal it from gases resulting from soil pollution, followed by asbestos remediation. Then work on the building’s windows will ensure that the structure is watertight. With the environmental hazards addressed and the building secure from water damage, the rest of the restoration work can proceed safely, Pickup said.
Gov. Phil Scott and the Agency of Commerce and Community Development also announced last week just over $3.3 million in funding for 34 rehabilitation and revitalization projects in 23 of Vermont’s designated downtown and village centers.
The Miss Bellows Falls Diner is one of those projects. The total project cost is estimated at $1.195 million, the award said, and the tax credit award is $145,000.
“The project includes restoration of the historic 1941 diner car and construction of a new addition with a commercial kitchen and ADA accessible restrooms,” the award stated. “State tax credits will support important code-compliance work as well as façade repairs(,) ensuring this landmark can once again be a flourishing community asset and gathering place.”
These tax credits “remain one of Vermont’s most effective and popular tools for breathing new life into every corner of Vermont,” said Department of Housing and Community Development Commissioner Alex Farrell in a news release.
The diner restoration project is the work of the Rockingham for Progress (RFP) citizens group.
“We got those pesky 75% plan sets in to Preservation Trust of Vermont,” RFP said in a release last week, “along with the report from the Historic Preservation consultant outlining how brilliantly compatible the new construction is with the classic lines of Worcester Lunch Car #771, aka The Miss Bellows Falls Diner. In turn, PTV has submitted it to the National Park Service.”
Rockingham for Progress Inc. is sponsoring a final Diner Dinner fundraiser of 2025 on the evening of Saturday, Oct. 25, at the Bellows Falls Moose Lodge, where the group says they will update the community on the progress of the project.
“Moose Lodge member Aime Theroux will serve as chef and prepare roast pork, mashed potatoes, stuffing, squash, green beans, cranberry sauce, gravy, and rolls,” the group announced. “Please specify vegan option at time order is placed. Dessert will be apple crisp with whipped cream.”

Attorney General Rob Bonta’s team was the first to challenge Trump on taking over control of the state National Guard under a rarely used law that allows the president to do this in times of invasion, internal rebellion or when U.S. laws cannot be executed with “regular forces” — a contested term.


Can President Donald Trump call up the National Guard to enter a city even if the governor of that state says no? 
This basic question is under litigation across several federal courts in three states and is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. It has even more urgency now that Trump plans to send Department of Homeland Security personnel to San Francisco tomorrow, a move Gov. Gavin Newsom said is a precursor to the president’s sending in the National Guard. Trump said the city has a high crime rate and needs federal protection. City officials say crime is down.“This is right out of the dictator’s handbook. Donald Trump does this over and over again,” the governor said in a social media post. Newsom said before Trump can summon the National Guard, he needs to sow anxiety in the streets so he can then “solve for that” with federal troops.
Before news broke of federal agents arriving in San Francisco, California Attorney General Rob Bonta sat down with CalMatters today to talk about Trump’s use of the National Guard.
“It would be dangerous and wrongly decided to allow the president to do what he’s trying to do now, which is to act as if he’s above the law, act as if he’s a king, treat the National Guard as his royal guard,” he said. “He will deploy only to blue cities. He will use it to punish enemies. He will use it to target those people who didn’t support him.” 
Already Trump has issued an executive order directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to establish a new “standing National Guard quick reaction force” for “rapid nationwide
deployment,” California Department of Justice lawyers wrote to Supreme Court justices in a legal filing.Already federal courts are dealing with questions of the legality of sending state National Guard troops to Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland— cities in which the state attorneys general sued the Trump administration. 
California is central to the national issue
Bonta is a key player in that Blue State resistance. His team was the first to challenge Trump on taking over control of the state National Guard under a rarely used law that allows the president to do this in times of invasion, internal rebellion or when U.S. laws cannot be executed with “regular forces” — a contested term.California is ground-zero for this novel dispute. This is where Trump mobilized 4,000 of the state’s National Guard troops in June in response to two days of occasionally violent protests against federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles region.Prior to Trump’s federalization of those troops in June, at no time in U.S. history was the law invoked without the consent of the state governor. Use of the law is exceedingly rare: It was used just once before June by President Richard Nixon to mobilize troops during a postal worker strike in 1970.Bonta joined Oregon in suing Trump to halt him from sending the National Guard from Oregon, California and Texas to Portland, the site of sporadic protests. And California has filed legal briefings siding with Illinois to district and appellate courts, as well as the Supreme Court.
Frustratingly for the public, there’s no final answer in the near term. Instead, lawyers from liberal states suing the Trump administration are stuck in a standoff with Department of Justice attorneys defending the White House’s decisions. Each side has notched a roughly even collection of procedural victories and defeats with no sign of resolution. 
Even a decision from the nation’s highest court — issued from the so-called shadow docket — will likely be preliminary and prompt new iterations of legal challenges as the merits of this fundamental question inch upward through the courts.Adding to the confusion, most of the legal decisions and appeals about the president’s powers to take over the National Guard deal with temporary orders or preliminary injunctions. Only one court has answered a portion of the major issues around Trump’s powers — whether the National Guard and military can conduct law enforcement activities, and if so, what are the limits of those abilities.
In Bonta’s view and what California has argued in the courts, decisions siding with Trump could mean that the National Guard, controlled by the U.S. military, could accompany IRS officials on routine audits. It could mean armed forces at polling places on election day. A lower court judge sided with California, but the 9th Circuit Court agreed with the Trump administration to stay that injunction.
That question of the law enforcement powers isn’t before the Supreme Court, but it may get there soon.
Federal government says courts can’t second-guess Trump
Attorneys for the federal government have been consistent in maintaining that judges cannot even review the president’s decisions to federalize a state’s National Guard troops. However, California state attorneys wrote to the Supreme Court that “every court to consider the question has rejected that argument.”  So far district court judges in California, Oregon and Illinois have agreed with Bonta and his Democrat counterparts. But twice already a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that oversees the western states disagreed. They said the level of protest in the streets rises to rebellion and an inability for the federal government to conduct its operations.Two sets of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals homed in on the level of violence in Portland and Los Angeles outside of federal immigration facilities. They suggested the unrest was significant enough to impede federal operations, blocking lower court decisions that sided with California and Oregon lawyers. At one point the Portland facility was closed for over three weeks, one of the judge panels noted.
Some of the judges overseeing the cases have questioned whether the administration’s evidence is reliable. “In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts,” Judge April M. Perry wrote. She’s a Biden appointee.
She also noted a “a troubling trend of Defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots.”
The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals largely sided with Perry in her temporary restraining order blocking Trump from sending National Guard troops to the Chicago area. The White House appealed, and now that’s before the Supreme Court.Lawyers for the federal government wrote to the Supreme Court that Perry’s order blocking Trump from deploying the National Guard to the Chicago area “downplays or denies the ongoing threat to the lives and safety of federal agents, substitutes the court’s own judgment for the president’s about the need for military augmentation, and gives little or no weight to the United States’ interest in enforcing federal immigration law.”
Meanwhile, Bonta is troubled by the administration’s arguments that unrest in June can justify new and continued deployment of the National Guard months later. “It just doesn’t make any sense,” he said. His legal team has written that there needs to be a limit for how long the National Guard can be deployed if the violence that prompted their federalization has subsided.
Bonta is ready if Trump sends troops to Bay Area
Still, Bonta permits that of the three cities at the focus of the federal lawsuits over Trump’s ability to send the National Guard — Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland —  “I’d say the federal government had their strongest case in L.A.”
But is what occurred in Los Angeles a form of rebellion? Not according to Bonta.“Rebellion is a violent effort to overthrow the government,” he said. The violence against federal buildings and immigration law enforcement facilities in the cities Trump targeted “isn’t good,” but it’s not a government overthrow.“The trivializing of these very important words with high standards by the federal government, it is being done on purpose,” he said. The Trump administration “calls seemingly everything an emergency or rebellion or invasion,” including illegal immigration. “But that’s not what it is.”
While Bonta said he considered trying to preempt the president’s use of armed forces in San Francisco, the technicalities of the federal court system don’t let his team sue until the troops arrive. Yesterday he and Newsom said they’re ready to sue if Trump does that.“It’s difficult to do something preemptively,” Bonta told CalMatters.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Bonta-Newsom-Portantino-Gun-Laws-MG-03-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-22 20:17:14.812317

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)The Montana Public Service Commission ousted President Brad Molnar as its leader after months of controversy and bickering at the agency.
The PSC will take up filling the role at its meeting next Tuesday, but PSC President Jennifer Fielder said Wednesday she won’t accept a nomination.
“I have a very full plate with what I’m doing, and I would prefer to see a colleague who has more bandwidth take on the role,” Fielder said.
Fielder will take on the interim duties of president in the meantime.
Molnar has been in the spotlight since July when he announced he was being investigated — unfairly, he has said — for professional misconduct.
The investigation is pending.
An internal “response team” alleged Molnar interfered with the investigation and asked Gov. Greg Gianforte to temporarily suspend Molnar in a complaint.
In Montana, the governor has the authority to suspend a commissioner if the commissioner fails to perform their duties, as described in state law.
But the decision to strip Molnar of his leadership duties prompted his lawyer to tell the governor the complaint against Molnar is moot.
In a letter Wednesday, lawyer Matthew Monforton said the allegations Fielder made on behalf of the response team no longer exist given he no longer holds the powers earlier cited as problematic.
Those include supervising the executive director of the PSC, serving as its spokesperson, and presiding over meetings and setting agendas, the letter said.
“There is literally no remaining basis for suspension,” Monforton said in the letter. “Any interference (Fielder) previously alleged Commissioner Molnar could accomplish as President, she can now prevent in her role as acting President.”
A lawyer for the Governor’s Office asked Fielder to provide a written reply by Oct. 28.
Fielder said Wednesday she would not speak on behalf of the response team, but she personally does not agree with the letter Molnar’s lawyer sent.
“Whether the substance of Molnar’s request to the governor is relevant or agreeable is something the response team will have to take up and determine,” Fielder said.
One day earlier, commissioners voted 3-2 to vacate the office of president, with Commissioner Randy Pinocci joining Molnar in opposing the motion.
The PSC has five commissioners elected by district. All of them are Republican.
The commission regulates public utilities, and it makes decisions on complex issues that affect the bills people pay to NorthWestern Energy and Montana Dakota Utilities, for example.
At the meeting Tuesday, Commissioner Annie Bukacek made the motion to declare the office of the PSC president as vacant.
Bukacek said the Public Service Commission is arguably the most important agency in the state, it has had 10 months under Molnar, and it needs a change.
“Our staff deserve the best in leadership and need to be allowed to optimize their productivity,” Bukacek said.
A couple of significant cases are pending before the Public Service Commission, including a proposed merger between NorthWestern Energy, Montana’s largest public utility, and Black Hills Corp.
Molnar was most recently elected to the PSC in November 2024, and then elected as president by fellow commissioners in January 2025.
He previously served as a state legislator, and earlier, was elected to the PSC in 2004 and served until 2012, according to his PSC biography.
Commissioner Jeff Welborn said the PSC has a full plate, and Montanans deserve an agency working to full capacity, but things had become “disruptive,” and it was time to put distractions in the past.
“I also believe that we need to hit the reset button,” Welborn said.
Molnar said he bought a house in Helena in order to do the work, and he is working long hours to try to hold public utilities accountable, but he doesn’t get help.
“How many times do I ask for who can help me with regional and national issues?” Molnar said. “And the hands don’t go up.”
Molnar sat on the PSC in 2007 and voted against a proposal to sell NorthWestern to an Australian company that later declared bankruptcy.
His lawyer has argued Fielder wants to remove the only commissioner who has been through a case that’s similar to the merger currently pending before the PSC.
“Commissioner Fielder manufactured a crisis to remove a commissioner whose regulatory philosophy and institutional memory she found inconvenient,” the letter said. “Having failed to achieve suspension, she successfully orchestrated his removal as president.”
Fielder, however, said the PSC response team made the decision to file a complaint with Gianforte before NorthWestern announced its plans to merge.
After the team made the decision, NorthWestern made its announcement, and subsequently, the team finalized the letter and submitted it to the Governor’s Office, she said.
Fielder also said all the commissioners, not just Molnar, want to do due diligence on regulatory matters, and she believes it will be easier to do so without the disruptions from Molnar.
“I can say with certainty that I’m convinced that every elected commissioner wants to do the very best they can for the ratepayers of Montana, and in the public interest, to ensure that the regulated companies can provide the services that are safe and reliable and at the least cost,” Fielder said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Molnar1-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-10-22 20:17:14.812317

(Photo by Getty Images)A federal judge has allowed for a second time the addition of an Arkansas school district to a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a new state law requiring Ten Commandments displays in public schools. 
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be displayed “prominently” in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
Posters must be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions, and displays that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks on Wednesday permitted the inclusion of Garland County’s Lakeside School District as a defendant and Christine Benson and her minor child, B.B., as plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed in June by a group of Northwest Arkansas families of religious and nonreligious backgrounds. 
The families allege the state law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
Supporters of the law have argued the tenets have historical significance because they influenced the country’s founders in creating the nation’s laws and legal system.
Brooks issued a preliminary injunction in the lawsuit on Aug. 4, one day before the law was set to take effect, blocking implementation of the statute at the four school districts named as defendants in the original suit — Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs. 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed a motion to add the new defendant and plaintiffs to the case last week. Benson and her child assert the same claims and seek identical relief as the original plaintiffs; the only difference is their claims occurred on Sept. 25 when Lakeside School District officials hung copies of the Ten Commandments in classrooms, likely to comply with Act 573, according to Wednesday’s order. 
The state argued that permitting Benson and her child to be added to the lawsuit would complicate the pending appeal and burden parties by “dramatically increasing the scope and expense of discovery,” according to Wednesday’s order. Brooks called the state’s arguments regarding undue prejudice “unavailing,” noting that the plaintiffs are only seeking “to broaden the preliminary injunction geographically to include another school district.”
“Such a move would not affect the matters on appeal in any material respect,” Brooks wrote. “And as for the discovery burden that adding these new parties would create, the State’s argument is not tethered to reality.”
The Lakeside School District is accused of burdening Benson and her child’s free exercise rights “in exactly the same way” that the other defendant school districts are accused of burdening the other plaintiffs’ free exercise rights, Brooks said.
“Surely the State is not suggesting that time-consuming discovery will be needed to test the nature of Ms. Benson’s and B.B.’s religious beliefs to determine whether they are sincerely held,” he wrote. 
This is the second time Brooks has granted a request to add a school district to the original lawsuit. In late August, Brooks allowed the addition of the Conway School District as a defendant and district families as plaintiffs in the ongoing litigation. He later ordered Conway to remove Ten Commandments from its schools, and converted a temporary restraining order against the district into a preliminary injunction. 
A temporary restraining order is a temporary injunction that may be issued immediately, without informing all parties and without holding a hearing. It’s intended to last until a court holds a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, according to Cornell Law School. 
Ten Commandments displays have also made their way into higher education. Counteract USA, a Christian organization based in Tontitown, donated about 500 posters to the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville on Sept. 19, according to a university spokesperson John Thomas. The posters began being installed on campus earlier this month.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)CASSELTON, N.D. — Former U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp used her home state of North Dakota on Wednesday for the first of a series of meetings she hopes will help policy affecting rural America.  
“There has not been a kind of broad comprehensive look overall at rural policy … since during the Depression,” Heitkamp said in an interview Wednesday after the America’s Rural Future hearing at the Grand Farm research campus near Casselton. 
The project is a partnership of the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute. This project, led by co-chairs Heitkamp, a Democrat, and former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, launched earlier this year.
Heitkamp said rural issues, such as housing and health care, are often treated separately instead of as related challenges. The group plans to make policy recommendations in the fall of 2027.

Wednesday’s meeting had two panels: one on connectivity, highlighting North Dakota’s success in providing statewide high-speed internet access despite being a very rural state, and another on investing in rural communities. 
North Dakota’s broadband network is one of the factors that makes it attractive for data center developers and tech companies wanting to provide artificial intelligence. 
Mac McLennan, CEO of Minnkota Power Cooperative, said North Dakota has always been an export state, with not enough population to use all the ag, energy and other products it produces, with artificial intelligence a potentially valuable commodity. 
“What are people going to use for tools in the future?” McLennan asked. “An AI data center is fundamentally just a manufacturing facility for a tool you just can’t see.”
On investing, Megan Langley, executive director of the nonprofit StrengthenND, said it is great that there are grants and government programs available for rural communities, but small towns often lack the resources to even apply for grants or raise the matching money needed to qualify for programs. 
“Everything you need to successfully apply for a federal grant is really, really difficult for a rural community to be able to obtain,” Langley said. “When you think about community readiness, has a needs assessment been done? Has a feasibility study been done? Have architecture and engineering work been done? Likely not. … All that costs money, and a rural community may not have a lot of money.”
Afterward, Heitkamp noted the contrast of the dynamic possibilities for North Dakota highlighted in the first panel and Langley’s concern that some places are being left behind. 
“I think that’s going to be the story in a lot of places across the country,” Heitkamp said.
A second hearing is planned for Thursday in Mahnomen, Minnesota.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)A Pulaski County Circuit judge ruled in favor of a Franklin County resident Wednesday and said a June 2026 special election to fill a vacant state Senate seat unconstitutionally deprives voters of a voice in next year’s legislative session.
Judge Patricia James’ eight-page ruling orders the state to hold the election “as soon as practicable” after the legal limit of 150 days from the vacancy to ensure that the date for the special election “will not infringe upon or curtail the constitutional and fundamental rights of the citizens of Arkansas Senate District 26.”
Attorney General Tim Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said through spokespersons that that they plan to appeal.
James’ ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Colt Shelby of Cecil against Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester over Sanders’ decision last month to schedule a special election in the district after the death of Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch. Sanders originally set the election for Nov. 13, but after bipartisan pushback she revised the general election date to June 9, 2026. That date would still occur after the end of the fiscal session, set to begin April 8 and end May 7.
State law requires that special elections to fill legislative vacancies be held no later than 150 days after the vacancy, unless it is “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so.
Judge promises swift ruling in lawsuit over special election to replace Arkansas senator

James said in her ruling that setting the dates in June, after multiple county election officials testified that earlier dates were possible, amounted to “an infringement of a constitutional right based on the fundamental democratic principle of ‘no taxation without representation.’”
“There would be far-reaching ramifications if the Governor were allowed to deny duly elected representation for the citizens of the State of Arkansas,” James wrote.
Colt Shelby of Cecil filed the suit against Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester on Oct. 6. A hearing on his request for an injunction, declaratory judgment  and writ of mandamus was held Oct. 15.
James rejected arguments by Griffin’s office that the court did not have the authority to review Sanders’ decision on the dates, calling the assertion “ill-founded.”
“Although this court agrees that the Governor has the sole authority to set dates for a special election, that authority is not absolute,” the judge wrote.
Assuming the Legislature gave the governor absolute authority to set special elections “without the traditional checks and balances provided in our democratic system, the special election statute would be facially unconstitutional,” James wrote.
The law requires that a special election be held as soon as possible following the 150-day mark if holding later is necessary.  Three election workers from the counties comprising the Senate district testified that holding an election earlier than the June date was possible, James noted.
“Based on testimony presented during the hearing, an earlier more practicable date is available,” James said. “The court heard uncontroverted testimony … that they would be able to meet all the state and federal guidelines should the special election be set on” the same date as the regular midterm primary election, March 3.
“Governor Sanders is confident that on appeal, the law clearly giving the Governor the authority to set special elections will be upheld and ultimately save taxpayer dollars and ensure the election is free, fair, and secure,” Sanders’ spokesperson Sam Dubke said in a statement.
“I am disappointed by the ruling and plan to appeal,” Griffin said via a spokesperson.
Of prisons and other lawsuits
Legislators are expected to vote on funding the controversial Franklin County prison project during the 2026 fiscal session. Preliminary estimates put the cost of the 3,000-bed facility at $825 million.
Stubblefield staunchly opposed locating the prison in his district prior to his death, and it is deeply unpopular with many in the district. An appropriations bill to fund the prison’s construction failed five times in the 2025 session.
Numerous special elections over the last 15 years have gone past the 150-day mark, but Sanders’ revised schedule for Stubblefield’s seat is the longest by far, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Shelby said in a text message after the ruling that he was “so glad justice is served,” and that he hoped to have representation by February.
Arkansas Democrats sue state over House District 70 special election timeline

The ruling comes as a separate but similar lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Democratic Party of Arkansas over the House District 70 special election awaits a hearing. Sanders set identical special primary and general election dates after former Rep. Carlton Wing resigned last month to lead Arkansas PBS.
Party Chair Marcus Jones said in an emailed statement that the party was “encouraged” by the ruling in Shelby’s lawsuit.
“We are grateful that the court is siding with the residents of the River Valley, rather than our Governor who is abusing her power and refusing to fill these vacancies,” Jones said. “The court agrees: Taxation without representation is wrong. That’s why we filed suit with the Governor in House District 70, and that’s why we’re hopeful that we’ll prevail there as well.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire Republicans seem to understand that the state has a property-tax problem, so that’s good. The bad news is that their idea of problem-solving consistently rests on finding new ways to blame the state’s schools for an unfair funding system of which the districts are victims not causes.
To that end, Republicans on a House committee last week advanced legislation to make district budget caps mandatory. The argument seems to be that the only way to rein in New Hampshire’s punishingly high property taxes is to limit public school spending to whatever the district spent in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.
To call that a duct-tape solution — and an impressively shortsighted one at that — is to give it far too much credit. The cap is simply a new way for Republicans to avoid addressing an old problem of the state’s own making. 
If House Bill 675 doesn’t finally remove the GOP’s self-applied label as the “party of local control,” I’m not sure what will. But I guess something’s gotta give when your caucus is so corralled by ideology that the menu of solutions has all the depth of a “chicken or fish” wedding reception invitation. 
The Democrats, who too often choose electoral safety over bluntly expressing the fiscal truths we can all see and feel, are not blameless either. Even if an income tax is never realized as policy, the conversation still matters. New Hampshire’s school funding mess is a silent, locomotive tragedy.
Because New Hampshire Republicans are by nature opposed to income taxes — for which their definition extends to taxes on interest and dividends — the only relief they can offer to property-tax payers is to attack what those taxes mainly pay for: public schools. This nation long ago realized that the education of each subsequent generation was fundamental to its survival, yet Republicans have worked tirelessly in recent years to demonize that public good for no other reason than to protect a tax philosophy that greatly favors the wealthy and overburdens everybody else.
Just know that when Gov. Kelly Ayotte says “we’re not going to MASS up our great state” with higher taxes or an income tax, which she did in a press release targeting Democrats this week, she may as well come out and say what she really means: Republicans are going to keep downshifting costs to low-income and middle-class New Hampshire residents because that’s all that Republican tax philosophy allows.
If you don’t believe me, you should listen to them.
When Republicans talk about funding for public education — or other public goods such as Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — they do so only in their native language of free enterprise. That is why words like “waste” and “bloat” are categorically attached to school district budgets and safety net programs, and the inherent flaws of a universal school voucher program (like, you know, paying wealthy families to send their kids to private school) are explained away as a shift toward “competition” meant to foster excellence through free-market natural selection.
To Republicans, the concept of a public good that does not build wealth for a few is anathema.
Most people cherish efficiency — we are biologically hardwired to cherish it — so if a Republican lawmaker has nonpunitive ways to help districts make efficiency gains, bipartisan support would come easily even when that proposal falls well short of a solution. Also, I don’t think anybody is arguing that New Hampshire’s 100 or so school districts are equally skilled at managing their budgets. But you don’t have to look very closely at Republicans’ latest proposals to the funding mess to see that they aren’t intended to be solutions at all: They are the means of designed deterioration.
There is a reason why our community schools exist as a core public good: They are too important to be left fully vulnerable to the forces of private enterprise. Generation after generation, the people have served as willing stewards of this system because that is what a stable society demands of its educated citizens. You see, sometimes the benefits of public programs, like an education for all children regardless of their personal circumstances, are so obvious that people never think to ask, “What’s in it for me?” 
But that’s the question Republicans now want taxpayers to ask of their public schools, to which I would answer: Everything. Everything you value is what’s in it for you.
I get the feeling that Republicans won’t be happy until the whole of public education is outsourced to YouTube, or its eventual AI successor, as if teaching our children was the same as programming our machines. I’m betting the instructional videos would be carefully curated, too, knowing how much the “party of local control” likes to meddle with curriculum decisions.
Sure, the Republican vision I’m describing is a dystopian place where few would want to live, but at least we’ll still have that New Hampshire Advantage.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/domeedfunding-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-10-22 20:01:15.153270

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it arrested 105 people on immigration violations in the raid. The FBI announced five arrests of people linked to the alleged illegal gambling operation.
Earlier Wednesday, Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said the FBI, not ICE, led the raid. In a joint statement, they called the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s statement that gave ICE credit for the raid “completely false and a serious misrepresentation of the facts.”

“BCBSMT was notified by Conduent that some BCBSMT member data was impacted by a January 2025 cyber incident. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana systems were not impacted by this incident. However, because of our relationship with Conduent, BCBSMT members were impacted by Conduent’s incident. Conduent will be mailing letters to impacted members.
“Conduent is a BCBSMT third-party service provider that offers mailroom, payment and other back-office support services. If a BCBSMT member’s data has been impacted by this incident, it is due to BCBSMT’s relationship with Conduent.”
 
The Conduent data breach has been reported throughout the cybersecurity world, and the company told investors through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its bottom line was being impacted because of notification and potential costs associated with it. It said that in January, hackers “exfiltrated” personal data after a breach.
Brown’s office described the breach and the issues more emphatically.
“This breach is not just a technical lapse. This is a deeply disturbing incident with far-reaching and jaw-dropping consequences for our citizens,” Brown said. “Montanans have every right to expect their personal data, especially sensitive health information, to be protected by the entities they trust. The severity of this breach underscores the urgent need for robust oversight and our agency to take swift and immediate action to protect Montana consumers.”
While Douglas said that Conduent will be notifying and contacting customers, Brown said that his office is not aware that any customers have been contacted. The breach occurred between Nov. 8, 2024, and March 5, 2025. The data may have exposed names, addresses, birth dates, billing and medical data, phone numbers and “other sensitive information,” according to state officials.
For now, Brown’s office is urging customers to review carefully any explanation-of-benefits information and report suspicious financial activity immediately. Those who believe there has been suspicious activity related to the breach are urged to access the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance website or contact Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield’s dedicated member support line.
Montana law requires that any regulated company report a data breach involving residents’ personal information “without unreasonable delay,” said a spokesman for Brown’s office. The office also said that it received notice of the breach for the first time on Oct. 8.
Montana law gives the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance the power to launch an investigation. Tyler Newcombe, the communications director for Brown, said the office is moving aggressively to review documents, conduct audits, and determine whether state or federal law was broken.
“If we find misconduct or non-compliance, we use every enforcement tool at our disposal to protect and inform Montanans,” Newcombe said.
If an investigation finds that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield or a third-party vendor did not meet its legal obligation to protect data, the commissioner could issue fines of as much as $25,000 per violation.
“With any investigation, we act with urgency and resolve, but each investigation is thorough — designed to ensure no stone is left unturned,” Newcombe said. “As soon as we have actionable findings to report, we will inform the public immediately.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_7117-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-22 20:01:15.153270

Durand was arrested later and charged with theft of trade secrets, which is a felony. Screenshot of Georgia Public Service Commission video streamPatty Durand, a former Democratic candidate for the Georgia Public Service Commission and a clean energy advocate, was arrested Tuesday for the alleged theft of a Georgia Power document containing trade secrets during a commission meeting earlier that day.
Georgia Capitol Police arrested Durand, who is a frequent critic of the PSC, on Tuesday before transferring her to Fulton County Jail. According to the arrest warrant, Durand “intentionally (took) a booklet containing confidential information owned by Georgia Power Company without permission.” Durand’s arrest was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Durand did not yet have an attorney listed as of Wednesday, according to the Fulton County Clerk’s Office. Attempts to reach Durand for a comment Wednesday were unsuccessful.
The arrest warrant alleges that Durand was captured on a video recording re-entering the PSC meeting room during a lunch break and walking past a desk containing a booklet labeled “Georgia Power Trade Secrets.”
Durand initially picked up the booklet and put it back. She then walked past a second desk, picked up a similar booklet, “flipped through the booklet briefly before placing the booklet into her purse and left the meeting room without returning,” according to the warrant.



This week’s PSC proceedings were held to consider a request from Georgia Power to add nearly 10,000 megawatts to the state’s power grid. About 60% of the energy requested would come from expanding or building new gas plants, while 40% would come from renewable energy.
Durand, who this year founded Georgians for Affordable Energy, a watchdog organization, claimed in her comments during a public hearing earlier Tuesday that Georgia Power is prioritizing profits for its five affiliated gas companies in building natural gas power plants instead of focusing more on solar panels and battery storage. She said that Georgia Power should be held accountable for its “immoral” actions.
“There is no court in the land that would allow that kind of corruption to go on, and I have no idea why the state of Georgia does,” Durand said.
She also criticized Georgia Power in a Sunday email newsletter for seeking approval for a plan that she estimates could cost customers over three times as much as the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion project. Durand wrote that while Georgia Power’s filing shows about $15.7 billion for certified projects, a project cost summary table is “fully redacted.” Durand claimed that energy experts estimate those redacted costs to be “about $5-6 billion dollars, a huge number.”
Durand alleged the costs are redacted because the company doesn’t want the public to know “these costs are required to be paid by customers throughout construction.”

Jennifer Whitfield, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said in a statement that “the stakes are really high for Georgians right now and people feel desperate,” but denounced Durand’s alleged theft.
“While we do have serious concerns about Georgia Power’s use of trade secret, those concerns must be addressed through the proper, legal channels,” Whitfield said.
Sarah Brewerton-Palmer, a First Amendment and business law attorney and president of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said in a phone interview that the incident underscores the need for the PSC and other governmental agencies to balance allowing companies to shield sensitive business information with ensuring adequate government transparency.
“Whenever information in the hands of the government is kept from the public, it raises a specter of suspicion, and this lack of transparency lets conspiracy theories fester and tends to feed a public perception of unfairness and background deals and all that sort of stuff, which is why we have transparency laws in the first place,” Brewerton-Palmer said.
A perceived lack of transparency in the PSC’s dealings with Georgia Power has been scrutinized more intensely recently after the commission approved six energy bill increases over two years. Groups like SELC and other organizations filed a motion seeking access to some data on cost and power generation from the public, according to a July report from the AJC. However, the PSC denied the motion, stating that it might reconsider the issue in the future.
Matthew Kent, a spokesperson for Georgia Power, said in a statement that confidential data is meant to protect customers’ interests and “ensure we deliver the best value to all customers.”
“Unauthorized disclosure risks harming both our company, the vendors and contractors with whom we do business, and the customers we serve,” he said.
The Georgia Republican Party quickly pounced on Durand’s arrest. Early voting is underway for a pair of commission seats that are on the ballot, and Georgia Republicans have been openly concerned that Democratic candidates Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson could flip two PSC seats in this year’s unique off-year election, where experts say that municipal elections could favor Democratic mobilization.
Josh McKoon, who chairs the state GOP, said in a statement that “there’s no leftist activist more involved in pushing the candidacies of the two Democrat candidates for PSC than Patty Durand” and that she built “her brand” by attacking the PSC.
“Georgia voters should take note of these illegal actions,” McKoon said in a statement. “The rhetoric of Patty Durand telegraphs the Democrats’ extreme plans for the PSC – plans that will lower our power supply and reliability and that will lead to higher prices for Georgia families.” 
Durand was a Democratic candidate for the commission in 2022 before she was drawn out of the district she was attempting to represent through redistricting. That election was ultimately postponed because of an ongoing lawsuit challenging the at-large method of seating commissioners, who represent districts but are elected statewide.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/durand-at-psc-102125.jpg,,,2025-10-22 20:01:15.153270

The agency’s bilingual team stepped up as interpreters and support links for both the Glenn Valley Foods workers swept up in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push and an understaffed Lincoln County jail unfamiliar with the detainees’ languages and cultures.
Hope Esperanza quickly became known as an on-the-ground resource for families, attorneys and news updates related to Nebraska’s largest immigration raid since 2018. The organization’s response led to awards and recognitions from other advocacy groups.
Some of that notoriety has piqued interest in the nonprofit’s origins and the North Platte native behind the group.
Split between countries
TinaMaria Fernandez, 43, is herself the product of a family split by U.S. immigration policy. Her dad, from Mexico, met and married her mom while he was in North Platte working at a local horse-processing plant. Despite a lengthy attempt, his visa was not renewed and the young family lived apart.
“My mother stayed here by the wishes of my father, to raise me in the United States,” Fernandez said. “We’d go and visit my dad in Mexico.”
At one point, Fernandez said, her parents thought they had necessary paperwork in order and her mom and family members traveled south to get him. “They wouldn’t let my dad come back across.”

Eventually, she said, her dad urged his wife to move on. Each began new relationships. Fernandez has siblings and relatives on both sides of the border. To this day, she said, her parents talk sometimes by phone. 
 “There’s that love, you know, they always say that it’s two countries that separated us and separated our hearts and our family.”
Fernandez said her North Platte childhood was “not the greatest,” and while she wonders how life might have been different had her father been closer, she chooses to believe “everything happens for a reason.”
She said her own immigration-related experiences helps to better understand people she works with through Hope Esperanza, including the Glenn Valley and other federal detainees awaiting deportation at the Lincoln County facility. 
“I see, I know the effects of it,” said Fernandez. “My heart goes out to them.”
Building momentum
One of the organizations that recently recognized Hope Esperanza and Fernandez noted that her education and jobs helped prepare her to run the North Platte agency, which is fueled by grants and philanthropic donors and has grown to a team of more than 20 people.

Fernandez earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Wyoming and a nursing degree from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. She worked as a social worker for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Correctional Services and as a counselor for Lutheran Family Services. 
While in nursing school, Fernandez said she was horrified by a particular family’s health care challenges she believed were exacerbated by language barriers. She saw children removed from Spanish-speaking households that likely could have stayed together had parents tapped available support services.
That spurred her to conduct a six-month needs assessment, focusing on the county’s Latino community, the  area’s largest minority group. She contacted many of the roughly 90 nonprofits working in Lincoln County to understand why gaps existed. Hope Esperanza formed to help plug the gaps.
Then still a student, Fernandez started small, filling her SUV with food to deliver to families. Her team at one point made and sold enchiladas to help stave off a mom’s eviction. 
Fernandez called it “God’s work” that the group’s nonprofit status and structure were newly in place when North Platte learned the region would become home to a Sustainable Beef LLC processing plant, one of the largest processing facilities in the nation.
“God was sending a whole lot more needs our way,” Fernandez said, referring to an incoming workforce that largely would be newcomers of different cultures whose first language is not English.











God was sending a whole lot more needs our way.

The rancher-owned plant reportedly will employ up to 850 workers and have a $1.5 billion community impact. Operations launched this spring, following years of preparation. 
Hope Esperanza, meanwhile, has been expanding services (Esperanza means hope in Spanish). The operation offers food, clothing and furniture aid; transportation and employment coordination, health and youth programs, safety and cultural events. Integration and language access classes are geared toward newcomers to the city of about 23,000 people.
Ripples of raid four hours away 
The group’s statewide notoriety grew after Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer got the call in June asking if his North Platte-based county jail could accept detainees that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested in the Omaha raid, four hours away.

Lincoln County had an established contract with the feds to house ICE detainees. But the 63 Glenn Valley workers increased the jail population by about 50%, the sheriff said, at a time when the facility was short-staffed. He said Hope Esperanza was a lifeline.
Kramer already had worked with Fernandez, and participated in bridge-building meetings the nonprofit holds with city and law enforcement officials.
Douglas County Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of the ICE action, said he had never heard about Hope Esperanza before the June 10 Omaha raid. Last week, the annual Hispanic Heritage Awards organized by Garcia and his wife Yanira recognized the group for its response and outreach to the migrant detainees.
“What really impressed us was they were not only providing basic interpretation and translation services, but they were a moral support and a human heart caring for the women going through that difficulty and separation from their families,” Garcia said.
He was told that on one visit to the jail, Hope Esperanza representatives played Selena music and the women inmates danced.
“They had a human moment together to lift up their spirits … in a very difficult moment when they were detained, separated from their families,” Garcia said. “The fact we had Hope Esperanza there was a blessing for those women and for us as a community.” 
Garcia and some other immigrant advocates reacted much differently to a recent proposal by the Douglas County sheriff and the then-state director of the League of United Latino American Citizens (LULAC). 
Sheriff Aaron Hanson had sought to lease space in the Omaha-based county jail to the feds for ICE detention, framing the idea as both a profitable and humanitarian venture, partly because it would keep Omaha detainees closer to their families.
The prospect was shot down by a majority of the County Board. Garcia has said the increased ICE presence would lead to more fear and local arrests.
“There is a difference between being in favor of detention versus people on the ground helping individuals in these unfortunate circumstances,” Garcia said.
Nebraska Appleseed earlier this month also recognized Fernandez. The Lincoln-based group selected her for its “Roots of Justice Award” even before the raid, and cited ongoing efforts to connect young Latinos to their culture and new workers to community resources.
“She brings a group of diverse community members together on a regular basis to problem solve and plan for the community,” said Appleseed senior welcoming coordinator Christa Yoakum. 
Ruby Méndez López said she was impressed by Fernandez’s varied roles, including as a mom and wife. “She’s heading this organization but also is a full-time nurse and does a million other things around North Platte.”
Elephant on her chest 
Though the number of detainees from Omaha’s Glenn Valley raid has dwindled to a couple, the Hope Esperanza team said it still meets with other migrants held by ICE in the Lincoln County jail.

Staff and volunteers also see an influx of newcomers due to the meatpacking plant and are providing language access and other services. The nonprofit is trying to launch a health clinic for underserved populations.
Fernandez continues to work on a book that delves into her journey and identity shaped by immigration and separation. She already authored a children’s book about belonging, illustrated by her son Micah and titled “Nico’s New Home.” 
She said she has yet to fully process events of the past year related to ramped up immigration enforcement but sometimes feels the weight of an “elephant” on her chest.
“I don’t see politics,” Fernandez said. “I see displaced families. I see separated families, kiddos going to bed at night without their parents. It’s a lot.”

Washington’s Department of Health is launching an online tracker showing locations where people with the disease visited. 
Washington has seen 11 confirmed measles cases this year, almost all of which were tied to international travel, according to the health department. Five were children under 5 years old. One more was an older child, and the other five were adults. The most recent infection was confirmed in late August, in a Spokane County infant linked to a case in Idaho.
Washington this year hasn’t had a measles outbreak, defined as three or more related cases.
But on Oct. 13, an unvaccinated visitor from Arizona who had measles traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, the only location listed on the new state map launched this week. Travelers who were at the airport between 11:30 a.m. and 2:40 p.m. that day should watch for symptoms until Nov. 3. The incubation period for measles is 21 days. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes and a rash beginning on the face before spreading down the body. The highly contagious disease spreads through the air. Most people recover within 10 days without long-term medical issues. But it can be serious or deadly, especially for young children. 
Other parts of the country have been seen measles cases surge this year, with the nation reaching a more than three-decade high of nearly 1,600 nationwide, as of last week. In 2024, there were just 285 reported cases.
More than half of the infections this year have been in Texas, but a new outbreak in Utah and Arizona has grown to more than 100 cases. South Carolina also has seen cases rise. The outbreaks have been tied to declining childhood immunization rates.

Nationwide, one in eight cases this year has resulted in hospitalization. There’ve also been three deaths, the first in years in the United States.
Statewide in Washington, about 91% of kindergarten-age children were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella in the 2024-25 school year, according to state data. That was down from over 94% in the 2019-20 school year. The counties with the lowest immunization rates were Pacific, Pend Oreille, Stevens, Clallam and Jefferson. 
In 2019, Washington had 86 confirmed measles cases, largely in Clark County, where vaccination rates lagged behind the state average.
“Information and vaccination are our strongest tools for preventing measles and keeping our communities safe,” said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, the state’s health officer.
Across the country, vaccination rates have dropped since the pandemic. Since taking over as health secretary in the Trump administration, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has deemphasized vaccines as a tool to stave off measles. 
During Washington’s outbreak in 2019, Kennedy came to Olympia to advocate against legislation that would have made it harder for parents to opt their children out of the measles, mumps and rubella shot.

 The Senate nearly unanimously approved Senate Bill 246  Wednesday afternoon. It now awaits Gov. Josh Shapiro’s signature. Shapiro’s office didn’t respond to the Capital Star’s inquiry as to whether he’ll sign the measure. 
State law already requires schools to notify local law enforcement and the commonwealth’s Department of Education. 
SB246 adds parents, guardians and school staff and faculty to the list of parties that must be notified “using a method of communication likely to reach” them by public and private schools – including intermediate units and cyber and charter schools. 
It applies to “any knife, cutting instrument, cutting tool, nunchaku, firearm, shotgun, rifle and any other tool, instrument or implement capable of inflicting serious bodily injury” brought to campus and/or school sponsored events and transportation. 
The identity of the student would not be disclosed in the notification; however, it would be relayed to their teachers and other staff to whom they’re assigned, under the proposal.

Sen. Jarrett Coleman (R-Lehigh), co-sponsor with Philadelphia Democrat Christine Tartaglione, has said a constituent raised the issue after discovering a knife was brought into their child’s school because another parent read about it in a police report.
Democratic Senators Lindsey Williams (Allegheny) and Amanda Cappelletti (Delaware/Montgomery) cast the only votes against the measure Wednesday. 
Williams said previously she fears the new rules will “cause parents unnecessary fear and anxiety.”
She spoke about her concerns ahead of the first vote on the bill during a meeting of the Senate Education Committee, of which she’s minority chair. 
The measure doesn’t differentiate between a kid taking their parent’s gun to school versus “a student who goes to the office to hand over a pocketknife he left in his backpack from hiking this over the weekend,” she said. 
Cappelletti’s office was unable to provide details about her vote. 
Some lawmakers also raised concerns with the vague definition of what constitutes a weapon in the original version of the measure. 
At one point, the proposal expanded to require alerts about bullying, harassment, incidents involving serious bodily injury and intentional property damage exceeding $1,000. Those provisions came out of the bill before its final passage in the House during the summer with only Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton/Union) opposing it.
Rep. Barb Gleim (R-Cumberland) made an unsuccessful attempt at that time to add another party to notify: the Pennsylvania Information Management System (PIMS). The point, she said, would be to generate better data on weapons in schools and ultimately inform policies and practices to make them safer.

BURLINGTON — The former Addison County sheriff accused of committing sexual assault was put on a two-year probation Wednesday morning for the crimes he committed while in office in 2022. The sentence is a result of his plea deal, which allowed Peter Newton to plead guilty to lesser charges and potentially avoid jail time. 
Earlier this year, Newton pleaded guilty to lewd and lascivious conduct and simple assault, lesser charges than those originally filed against him, which included two counts of felony sexual assault and unlawful restraint. 
Chittenden County Superior Criminal Court Judge John Pacht ruled that Newton’s sentence on the charge of lewd and lascivious conduct would be deferred for two years and he would be placed on probation. If Newton does not violate probation during those two years, the charge will be removed from his record.
Then Pacht made a distinction on the simple assault charge. He ruled that Newton would serve a 6-to-12-month sentence for the crime, all suspended for two years. That charge will remain on his criminal record even if he completes his two years of probation with no violations.

The decision came after Pacht heard from the victim in the case, who told the courtroom how her “body was dark purple with bruises from his hands.” The woman, who met Newton while he was doing his job as sheriff, said she now feels unable to trust the systems designed to protect her. VTDigger does not name victims of sexual assault.
“He used his position of authority and power to harm and exploit me,” she said.
Newton was originally charged with two felony counts of sexual assault, one felony count of unlawful restraint and one misdemeanor count of domestic assault. Together, the charges could have carried up to 14 years in prison. Then, earlier this year, Newton pleaded guilty to lesser charges of lewd and lascivious conduct and simple assault. 
Though the prosecution agreed to the terms of the agreement, the victim said the outcome leaves her to fear for both her safety and the safety of her kids. 
Pacht himself said he had concerns about the plea deal because of the brutality of the crimes described in police reports — and because Newton met the victim while doing his job as sheriff. 
“What could be described as an abuse of power and abuse of trust is pretty significant here,” Pacht said. 
After hearing from the victim, and considering the fact that both the victim and Newton were intoxicated during many of the events in question, Pacht reasoned a plea deal was an appropriate resolution to the case.
The victim, who sat in the prosecution’s chair, told the courtroom she was strongly opposed to the deferred sentence. 
“It simply goes away after his probation, as if none of this ever happened, while the effects of this assault are lifelong for me,” she said. 
Pacht told the courtroom he thought it was necessary in the interest of justice for Newton to be permanently convicted of assault. He said it isn’t likely the court would consider ever sealing those records after hearing the victim’s testimony. 
Newton will have the same conditions of release on both charges, which bar him from serving in any law enforcement office. His conditions also require that he not contact or harass the victim or her family members. 
The former sheriff will also be required to participate in individual mental health counseling and complete a 26-week domestic violence rehabilitation program. Newton will also be barred from drinking alcohol, have to submit regular urine tests and take part in substance use counseling. 
Earlier in the hearing Pacht said that, while he had concerns with the agreement, he understood “why the case was settled this way,” he said. 
In police affidavits, the victim said that she estimated she was under the influence about 90% of the time she and Newton would have sex. 
“Peter was playing pharmacist. He was playing bartender,” she told police in 2022, affidavits show. 
The affidavit, written by Vermont State Police Detective Sgt. Angela Baker, details Newton’s extensive abuse over months. In many instances described in the affidavit, Pacht would restrain the victim and sexually assault her without her consent. 
From his bench, Pacht said that both parties were likely “highly intoxicated” during many of the incidents described in the affidavit from police. “It made it complicated, I think, for both parties to get a complete understanding of exactly what did and didn’t happen. And that’s how we arrived at this agreement,” Pacht said. 
The plea agreement leaves “everybody a little uncomfortable” because the victim noted “a degree of behavior much more expansive” than the altercation that happened the day the victim decided to contact police, Pacht said. 
The victim originally met Newton when she sought help from him, as the sheriff, to leave a past abusive relationship. Then their sexual relationship began and he became abusive, she said.  
“Peter represented safety to me, and I believed that he and his office would protect me,” she said in a shaky voice. 
“Instead, he violated that protection. He used his position of authority and power to harm and exploit me,” the victim said. While she was speaking, Newton looked down and pet his dog who sat on the floor by his side. 
The victim’s assigned advocate, Armina Medic, showed the court a picture of a large bruise across the victim’s right buttock, taken by law enforcement when she reported Newton. The bruise was dark purple and inches long. 
The day Newton accepted the plea agreement in January, he posted on Facebook, referring to the mark as “a small bruise left on her butt from a spanking during sex.” 
In the post, he said that after his arrest he “left the courthouse to face this nightmare from hell.” In his post, Newton also declared that he may run for political office because he is “good at standing up to corruption.” 
After the victim’s statement, Pacht said that the picture of the victim’s bruise was not small at all. What’s most concerning about the case is that someone who is significantly trusted in a community “decided it was a good idea to get into a relationship, by his own description, with a woman who was quite vulnerable at the time,” Pacht said.

‘Reduction in force’ plans a judge required the federal government to turn over detail only two ‘abolished’ positions clearly based in Wyoming, though observers say it’s an incomplete list. 
The post Trump’s Interior layoffs appear to mostly spare Wyoming, though the workforce is being kept in the dark appeared first on WyoFile .","Headlines flooded media outlets around the country this week detailing the Trump administration plans to permanently “abolish” 2,050 jobs at the U.S. Department of the Interior, but how the layoffs will impact Wyoming remains unclear. 
An accounting of the “reduction in force,” or RIF, became public in a court document filed Monday. The disclosure was required by a federal judge out of Northern California who issued a temporary restraining order in response to a federal labor union lawsuit. Although the Interior Department has a large presence in Wyoming — a state that’s half federal land — the legal filing only revealed two clearly in-state positions that are being eliminated. 
Both those “abolished” positions are with the Bureau of Reclamation’s Wyoming Area Office. The filing does not specify which jobs are being removed from the office, which manages irrigation, flood control infrastructure and associated land in river basins west of the Continental Divide in Wyoming and parts of Colorado and Montana. A WyoFile inquiry yielded no response or information from the office, which is only partly operational due to the federal government shutdown. 
The uncontrolled spillway of the Pathfinder Dam, pictured in June 2016, is an example of water infrastructure administered by the Bureau of Reclamation. (BuRec). 
The attempted layoffs are coming at a time when many federal government employees have been furloughed because of the shutdown. The funding lapse, now in its third week, is the second longest in history, though many federal functions and properties, such as the national parks, are still going or being left open.
President Donald Trump has said he’s laying off federal workers because of the shutdown, which he is blaming on Congressional Democrats. But Interior Department officials wrote in court filings that the layoffs are unrelated and have been in the works for months. 

How is the 2025 government shutdown impacting you? WyoFile wants to hear from you.

Notably, court filings disclose only a subset of the jobs U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is planning to eliminate — positions covered by labor unions that are plaintiffs to the lawsuit. It is “likely” that other layoffs are slated for other offices, but so far the judge has not required the Interior Department to disclose the entirety of its RIF plans, according to Aaron Weiss, deputy director for the Center for Western Priorities.
“We know they are playing games and trying to hide the full scope of whatever the RIF plan is,” Weiss said. “Just because they haven’t said they aren’t planning RIFs for Wyoming does not mean that there aren’t RIFs coming.” 
Interior Department agencies with a major presence in Wyoming include the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs, among others.

Employees at the Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming headquarters in Cheyenne, for example, are not unionized. That status likely explains why the office’s staff wasn’t listed in the recent legal filing that discloses hundreds of layoffs for BLM state offices in Oregon, Utah, California, Idaho, Arizona and Colorado.
BLM-Wyoming employees have not been informed of any mandatory layoffs, according to a source who’s not authorized to speak on the matter. 
It’s a similar story for the national parks, like Yellowstone and Grand Teton. Although Interior’s legal filing lists 272 National Park Service positions slated for elimination, no jobs tied to Wyoming parks have been disclosed and staff have not been informed of any pending layoffs, according to another source also not authorized to speak about the matter.  
Weiss, at the Center for Western Priorities, attributed the secrecy around Interior’s RIF plans to their unpopularity. The layoffs will cost local jobs and inhibit permitting of commercial activities on federal lands, like grazing and oil and gas drilling. 
“It will harm local communities across the West,” Weiss said. “They know that this is indefensible. Rather than own up to it, they’re trying to hide what they’re planning.” 
Slashing Interior’s workforce is part of the Trump administration’s overall effort to make the government smaller and more efficient. The downsizing has been organized under the Department of Government Efficiency, formerly helmed by billionaire Elon Musk.

A hearing is set […],"(Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)The Nevada Attorney General’s Bureau of Consumer Protection contends rate changes approved last month by the Nevada Public Utilities Commission as part of a $119 million rate hike for NV Energy are prohibited by state law. The BCP is one of several intervening parties now asking the PUC to reconsider its approval.
A hearing is set for Nov. 18 on the petitions for reconsideration. 
The PUC approved a peak demand charge that allows NV Energy to impose a higher kilowatt (kW) rate for the 15-minute period of the day with the most energy use. The change affects residential and small commercial customers in Southern Nevada. 
Nevada law, the BCP notes in its petition for reconsideration, prohibits the PUC from approving a rate that “requires a residential customer to purchase electric service at a rate which is based on the time of day, day of the week or time of year” unless the customer chooses to do so. 
To illustrate the apparent violation of law, BCP cites the commission’s order, which states the demand charge “‘varies based on the time during which the electricity is used.” 
Additionally, the BCP argues, another law prohibits the utility from charging “solar generators” (primarily rooftop solar customers) “any fee or charge that is different than that charged to other customers of the utility in the rate class” to which the customer would belong if they did not have a net metering system. 
The mandatory demand charge is unlawful to impose on full-service customers as well as on rooftop solar customers, the BCP asserts. 
Even if the demand charge is found not to violate the statute, its approval “is unreasonable as it lacks substantial evidence,” the BCP wrote. 
No other investor-owned electric utility in the U.S. employs a peak demand charge. 
The BCP notes the commission, in approving the demand charge, stated the “uniqueness of the circumstances in Nevada warrants seeking rate design alternatives reflective of the legal and regulatory framework specific to Nevada.” 
“The so-called ‘uniqueness’ of Nevada is not a valid, sufficient rationale to implement a mandatory untested new time-based rate structure,” the BCP countered. The public’s response to the order has been “vehemently negative, confounding and filled with fear of rate-shock,” the BCP asserted.
Aggrieved ratepayers are expected to sound off on the uncertainties of the peak demand rate Wednesday at a consumer session at the PUC offices in Las Vegas.  
Nevadans for Clean Affordable Energy, Nevada Solar Association, Vote Solar, and the Solar Energy Industries Alliance are also seeking reconsideration of the demand charge.  
The BCP petition for reconsideration restates its opposition to NV Energy’s plan to calculate credits for excess energy returned to the grid by rooftop solar systems every 15 minutes rather than monthly. The change will only affect customers in Northern Nevada who install rooftop solar after Oct. 1 of this year. It’s expected to increase monthly bills for those customers by about $11 a month. It’s also expected to deter future investment in rooftop solar, because it delays the return on investment in the system.
In April, the BCP argued that Assembly Bill 405, passed by lawmakers in 2017, requires that NV Energy calculate excess energy monthly.  
NV Energy contends the change is intended to reduce the disparity between rooftop solar and full-service customers, who subsidize solar customers to the tune of $50 million a year, according to the utility.  
“I don’t recall, in my 28 years (with the state), the Commission substantially modifying its original order because of a petition for reconsideration,” David Chairez, who retired this summer as the regulatory manager for the BCP, told the Current via text. He adds that Commissioner Tammy Cordova, the hearing officer in the rate hike case, may rewrite the order to “harden it for judicial review,” the next step in the appeal process.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NVEnergy_RC_003-scaled-e1683758765721-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:57:09.745050

Warren Daniel during a debate on a new Republican-led congressional map on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)On their way out of Raleigh, after two days of fierce debate on a new North Carolina congressional map, lawmakers in the state House unveiled and debated three proposals addressing longstanding budget and funding issues.
The bills were approved and sent to the Senate, where they will likely sit untouched for weeks as a four-month stalemate between Republican House and Senate leaders drags on until at least mid-November.
In the General Assembly’s monthly session, leaders in the House and Senate could agree on just two substantive proposals: a redrawn U.S. House map that granted Republicans another seat, and a stopgap spending measure. They still could not agree on a general operating budget that’s already months overdue, a way to fund Medicaid amid cuts to provider rates, or even tailored spending measures for raises for state workers and teachers.
House lawmakers, still in session Wednesday to finalize the map, rubber-stamped multiple measures to fund Medicaid and raise pay for state workers and law enforcement. Republicans also approved a bill that stripped Planned Parenthood from Medicaid contracts.
But the Senate had already gone home for the week — making it clear they had no interest in taking up the House’s bills, and instead urging them to take up bills sent over by the Senate.
In a joint statement Wednesday, Senate Republican budget chairs said they had sent House leaders a proposal earlier this week involving several of their own bills, but said the House had “ended negotiations.” They also said that the series of bills passed by the House on Wednesday were ineligible for debate under the rules of their adjournment resolution.
“It’s time to stop playing politics and come to the negotiating table,” they said.
So why didn’t the House take up that bundle of Senate legislation?
“I think our bills are better,” first-term House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) told reporters after votes Wednesday. “Each of those bills had some matter in it that’s a point of contention in our negotiations.”
The GOP standoff on the budget has spanned for months and spawned dozens of separate bills in both chambers. And it now appears likely to continue for months still; Hall said Wednesday the House did not have any votes scheduled for the rest of the year. The Senate, likewise, does not have any votes set in stone over the coming months.
The sticking points in the broader budget debate remain the same as they have for months: whether to adjust the state’s planned income tax cuts, how much to bump pay for state workers and teachers and whether to fund a planned children’s hospital.
Medicaid: House uses ‘toolbox’ of bills as Senate proposes separate solution
Republicans have expressed frustration with the state’s cuts to Medicaid, arguing they were unnecessary. But legislators in both chambers have proposed solutions to fund the program; the issue is finding agreement.
The House has proposed several options, including a new bill that would allow the state to tap into $190 million of reserve money. That bill was the result of conversations with Democratic Gov. Josh Stein and his health secretary Dev Sangvai, Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) told NC Newsline.
Senators are all but certain to ignore that bill, instead favoring their own proposal that funds Medicaid and includes separate line-items for rural health care and N.C. Children’s hospital.
The money for the children’s hospital, Senate Republican leaders noted in their statement Wednesday, “is half of the funding previously committed to by the House.”
House lawmakers on Wednesday approved a similar bill without the line items requested by the Senate.
“This is trying to come up with as many solutions as we can,” Lambeth said during debate. “We hope one of them will stick and pass.”
Lambeth was frank about the intention behind the slew of bills passed late Wednesday after the Senate had gone home.
“This is to show not only the Senate, but the people of North Carolina, this was our commitment to those people,” he said.
Lawmakers send miscellaneous spending bill to Stein’s desk
Though Republicans have not been able to agree on a comprehensive budget or a Medicaid funding plan, the legislature did approve another piecemeal spending measure – their third this year – with near-unanimous approval in both the House and Senate this week.
The spending bill would require the state to sell a piece of property in downtown Raleigh, requiring the State Records Center to relocate, and seek proposals to redevelop the old Rex Hospital at 700 Wade Ave, longtime home of the state Division of Employment Security.
The stopgap measure extends deadlines for some Helene relief programs. It also includes $2.5 million for General Assembly Special Police, allowing officers to protect members in response to threats.
UNC schools that are part of the NC Promise program that keeps tuition low would increase costs for out-of-state students from $2,500 per semester to $3,500 per semester. Tuition for in-state students will remain $500 per semester. Elizabeth City State University, UNC Pembroke, Fayetteville State University, and Western Carolina University are part of NC Promise.
The Department of Agriculture would receive $3 million to respond to avian flu. Half would be used for 10 new jobs, and the other half for lab expenses.
That measure is currently on Stein’s desk.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3964-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:57:09.745050

The state also had the largest increase in child poverty rate over the same period of time.","Map of child poverty concentrations measured over 2022-2024.

Annual Social and Economic Supplements. (Annie E. Casey Foundation)Louisiana’s child poverty rate over the past three years leads the nation, according to a new study that attributes the trend to rising costs and expiring public assistance programs. The state also had the largest increase in child poverty rate over the same period of time.
The report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation comes out as Louisiana — along with other states — has announced it will not provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in November, with Gov. Jeff Landry calling on Democrats in Congress to end the federal government shutdown that’s led to a lapse in SNAP funding. 
Compiled from U.S. Census data, the study shows how inflation and the end of pandemic-era economic assistance caused the rate of poverty for people under age 18 to rise across the country to 13% in 2024.
To account for the smaller sample size of states, the study measured rates across three years rather than annually. Louisiana has seen one of the steepest rises in child poverty rates, jumping from 11% measured from 2019-21 to 19% from 2022-24, tied for highest in the nation with Washington, D.C. 
Data for 2024 from the U.S. Census Bureau ranks Louisiana 49th with a child poverty rate of 24.8%. Only Mississippi’s rate was worse at 25%, and New Mexico was third worst at 21.4%. 
“Poverty poses a serious threat to children’s development and long-term well-being, with far-reaching consequences for our economy,” foundation vice president Leslie Boissiere said in a news release. “The data unequivocally show that public programs have a direct positive impact on our nation’s children.”
Over the past three years, 45 states and Washington, D.C., saw increases in child poverty. Regionally, states in the Southeast had the highest average child poverty rates in the country, while Midwestern states had the lowest. 
Louisiana’s 19% child poverty rate from 2022-24 represented about 200,000 Louisiana children, according to the study. 
SNAP is among the public programs the foundation credits with helping alleviate child poverty rates. Without federal food assistance, child poverty rates across the U.S. could rise 15% and affect an additional 1.42 million children, according to the report. 
The metrics used for the report capture local cost variations, tax credits and costs of essential expenses for families such as health care and housing to calculate whether or not a child is in poverty. The results also show that access to quality, well-paying jobs for family members and lowering the cost of household essentials like health and child care also play a large role in reducing the rate of child poverty.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-at-9.57.29 AM-e1761172404101-820x1024.png,,,2025-10-22 18:57:09.745050

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture rolled out a plan Wednesday to help “strengthen” the cattle industry and lower consumer prices for beef. 
The plan comes three weeks into the government shutdown and shortly after a proposal from President Donald Trump to import beef from Argentina to lower prices, which was opposed by cattle industry groups. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in a news release Wednesday her department’s plan will “expedite deregulatory reforms, boost processing capacity” and work “across the government to fix longstanding common-sense barriers for ranchers.” 
“America’s food supply chain is a national security priority for the Trump Administration,” Rollins said in the release. “We are committed to ensuring the American people have an affordable source of protein and that America’s ranchers have a strong economic environment where they can continue to operate for generations to come.”

Advancement of the plan includes a memorandum of understanding between USDA and the U.S. Department of the Interior, to “streamline and expand” ranchers’ abilities to graze on federal lands. The MOU is expected to be announced in November. 
The plan said it will prioritize grazing on the estimated 24 million acres of vacant grazing allotments across the country, and USDA plans to prioritize grazing as a form of wildlife management. The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service are also set to work with USDA to streamline permitting for ranchers to graze these lands. 
Additionally, the plan calls for collaboration across several agencies to develop “new standards of evidence” that allow ranchers to be compensated for livestock they lose to wolves, coyotes, bears or other predators. The massive budget law passed and enacted this summer, known as the “one big beautiful bill” also allows the Farm Service Agency’s indemnity programs to give ranchers coverage of up to 100% of market value for livestock lost to predators. 
Rollins said the plan incentivizes new producers to take up the “noble vocation of ranching.” The plan calls for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture to “include language encouraging applicants to promote outreach and education focused on ranching” on certain grant applications.
According to USDA data, cattle and cow inventories in the U.S. are on a declining trajectory, as are the number of farms in the country.
The second prong of the USDA plan calls for “transparent” labeling via Food Safety and Inspection Service enforcement of “Product of the USA” labeling, fair beef markets and enhanced local processing. 
According to the plan, USDA will launch another round of funding for the Meat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program to support small meat processors. The department will also reduce some of the regulations that increase costs for small processors. 
The plan additionally calls for the advancement of deregulatory actions taken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that impact the Waters of the United States rule, wastewater discharge requirements for processing facilities and effluent limitation guidelines. 
According to the plan, deregulating these reforms to the Clean Water Act will prevent $1.1 billion to $7.8 billion in future compliance costs for livestock operations and meat processors. 
These deregulating actions have been opposed by environmental groups who say it will lead to contaminated water supplies. 
The final prong of the USDA plan aims to increase “domestic and international demand in tandem with domestic supply,” in order to “lessen the volatility of the boom/bust cycle.” 
According to the document, the Food and Nutrition Service has already accepted more than $18 million in applications for “innovative” farm to school projects that encourage child nutrition providers to purchase from local ranchers and farmers. 
The USDA plan was announced alongside leadership for the Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Small Business Administration. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the plan helps to restore “whole foods as the foundation of the American diet” and ends stigma against “natural saturated fat in beef and dairy products.” 
“We will strengthen America’s ranching industry so families can choose nutrient-dense, minimally processed foods,” Kennedy said in the news release.
Ag and cattle groups focused on Argentina deal 
The American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association remained focused Wednesday on opposing the president’s proposals to purchase beef from Argentina. 
A communications director for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said Wednesday the association did not have a comment on USDA’s plan, but said the industry association is “still extremely concerned” by Trump’s continued push to purchase Argentinian beef. 
The president posted on Truth Social Wednesday that cattle ranchers “don’t understand” the benefits tariffs have had on their industry. Trump said cattle ranchers “have to get their prices down” for consumers. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices for ground chuck are at a historic high and have risen more than a dollar per pound since the beginning of the year. 
American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said in a statement that farm families “feel the impact of higher grocery costs, but don’t get to set the prices.”
“This is a pivotal moment for America’s cattle farmers as they make decisions whether to restock their pastures,” Duvall said. “Farmers know America’s families prefer to buy U.S. beef. If expanded imports push farmers deeper into the red, we face the unintended consequence of increasing reliance on other countries for our food and weakening our ability to rebuild a strong American herd.”
Rollins, in a Tuesday interview with News Nation, said a deal to import from Argentina “won’t be too much of a huge differential” from what the U.S. currently imports in beef.
FSA office to open Thursday
USDA plans to reopen Farm Service Agency offices Thursday, despite the ongoing government shutdown, to help farmers during harvest season regain access to farm safety net programs. 
Rollins made the announcement Tuesday on her social media, and later on several TV news shows. She said opening these offices will release over $3 billion in aid to farmers. 
Rollins clarified in an interview with Fox Business the $3 billion comes from “current plans” and does not represent the aid package the administration “will soon announce” to help farmers harmed by Chinese trade disputes. 
Due to retaliatory tariffs between the U.S. and China, the eastern nation has not bought any soybeans from U.S. farmers this season and instead purchased several shiploads from Argentina. 
Politicians in farm states and commodity groups continue to call on the administration to develop an aid package and to restore trade relationships for farmers.

Device was likely not an explosive capable of rendering great harm, Division of Criminal Investigation commander told WyoFile.
The post FBI, state authorities search for 2 ‘subjects of interest’ after firework munitions prompt Wyoming Capitol evacuation appeared first on WyoFile .","State investigators are searching for two people with suspected ties to Tuesday’s bomb scare at the State Capitol building.
The discovery of what was initially suspected to be an improvised explosive device drew a large law enforcement response and led to the capitol’s evacuation Tuesday. The incident remains under investigation by a number of local and federal agencies, including the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Officials from DCI, the lead investigative agency, announced Wednesday afternoon that video footage has identified two “subjects of interest.” The agency is working with federal officials to identify them, and has also asked for the public’s help. 
Authorities initially described the device as  a potential IED – the type of small homemade bomb made by insurgents in foreign combat zones. Having decommissioned and analyzed the package, which a bomb squad removed from the capitol grounds, DCI officials in Wednesday’s press release switched from referring to it as an IED to a “suspicious object.” The object was “likely a deconstructed live firework munition with a fuse,” the release read.  
In a brief phone interview with WyoFile, DCI Commander Ryan Cox said he did not believe the device had the explosive potency to harm nearby people had it exploded. 
“I don’t think it had the capabilities,” he said. Still, he said it was too early to describe what the intention behind whoever placed the device outside the capitol was. 
Tuesday’s scare came in a year marked by politically motivated violence, with the assassination of a Democrat state lawmaker in Minnesota and of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a speaking event in Utah, among other incidents. 
And though the device now appears less menacing than originally feared, whoever left the deconstructed firework munition still disrupted the seat of Wyoming government. 
On Tuesday morning, according to a Wyoming Highway Patrol news release, a pedestrian found the object laying on the Great Seal of Wyoming, which is embedded in the concrete outside the Capitol building. The state seal, which includes a woman in the center holding a banner proclaiming “Equal Rights” as well as references to mining and livestock, is found on the ground at the bottom of the grand staircase at the capitol’s south, and most principal entrance.
The pedestrian carried the item inside and brought it to the attention of the Wyoming Highway Patrol troopers who guard the Capitol. 
At 9:45 a.m., WHP ordered the Capitol evacuated. A bomb squad staffed by Laramie County deputies and Cheyenne police officers removed the package from the capitol. The bomb squad, along with FBI agents, decommissioned and analyzed the device. 
The building, and some nearby streets, were closed off during an investigation that went into the evening. While the surrounding streets were all reopened by 4:30 p.m., the Capitol was closed until Wednesday morning. 
When the evacuation order was issued, Gov. Mark Gordon, State Treasurer Curt Meier and State Auditor Kristi Racines were all gathered in the Capitol Extension for a regular meeting of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission. They abruptly halted the meeting to evacuate. 
On Wednesday, business had resumed as usual in the statehouse, a spokesperson for Gov. Mark Gordon told WyoFile that morning.
In their request to the public for assistance, DCI officials said they are particularly interested in video footage, images or information about “suspicious activity” at the statehouse between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Tuesday.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published by the Stowe Reporter on October 16.

In the 1820s, an early white settler in Vermont named Alexander Seaver constructed a small wooden dam on the Little River in the valley south of Stowe village, then known as Smith’s Falls.
He built a sawmill on the north side of the river and an iron forge to produce cast iron box stoves along with a home and barn. In 1836, new investors acquired the mill and the Seaver’s property. The new ownership included Lemuel and Abel Smith, two brothers who would go on, along with their family members, to propagate new industry in the expanding settlement over the next century or so, opening a grist mill, a starch factory that processed potatoes from the area’s farmers, a window sash, door and blind factory, a wood planing and dressing factory, a woodworking factory and a refitted butter box factory.
When Carrie R. Slayton, a descendent of the Smith family, died in 1971, her notes allowed a glimpse into the founding myth of how Smith’s Falls changed its name.
Her ancestor Lemuel Samuelson had set up a cracked saw blade that his wife would strike with a hammer when she needed to call in the men from their work, but the sound would carry across the valley and was soon employed in general announcement-making.
About a century prior on the other side of the world, Russian Empress Anna Ivanovna commissioned the construction of the Tsar Bell, a massive 20-foot, 222-ton bronze Orthodox bell made from the pieces of two formerly constructed ornaments. The bell, shortly after its completion in 1735, was broken during a fire at the Kremlin, and it fell down into the pit from which it was cast.
The Tsar Bell was so heavy that attempts to resurrect it from its casting pit were unsuccessful until 1836. Early residents of Smith’s Falls would have read contemporaneous news reports about the raising of the bell, and began calling their broken mill saw “The Bell of Moscow.”
When the first post office was opened in 1884 and they were required to name it, according to Slayton, an older resident named Gered Camp joked that “the bell fell and it’s just got to Moscow.” A vote was held on whether Smith’s Falls would take the name Moscow from another Vermont town then-named Moscow, and it was successful — the preceding Moscow changed its name to Calais.

A new historical society exhibit
In the 1970s, Tom Hamilton moved into the historic home where he and his wife still live in Moscow village. He helped lead the production of a new exhibit at the Stowe Historical Society, which, among other collected curiosities and tales from the village’s 200-plus years, tells the story of how Moscow got its name.
Hamilton, who came to Stowe from Long Island as a ski bum who stayed for the long haul, first got acquainted with the history of the village by inspecting the details of his own home.
“The mills came first, and then the people came, the workers came,” Hamilton said. “A lot of these houses were built out of lumber, including mine, from the wood that they couldn’t sell, so if you go to the attic, you won’t see timber that has four sides. You’ll see timber that has three sides and bark on one, so they would give it to the mill workers, and then they would build the houses.”
Much of the exhibit chronicles former landmarks that, unlike Hamilton’s historic home, no longer exist. The Smith’s Falls Covered Bridge, built in 1844, was removed a little over a century later.
When the early industry that defined the village began to fade and was replaced by hospitality, the stately Victorian manse called Pleasant View House was opened in 1876, and a Lake View Cottage on Lake Mansfield was available to lodgers looking for even more privacy. The House burned in 1950.

Though many of the historical structures in Moscow have been lost, some have been rebuilt or repurposed. When Stowe Selectboard member Ethan Carlson sought to rebuild the Moscow general store, he adhered closely to the design of the original building that was built in 1886 and demolished after its closure in 2016. That year, Stowe Electric also acquired the Moscow Mills land and built new offices.
The exhibit contains wooden toys and other artifacts produced at George F. Adams Woodworking Factory, which operated from 1914 to 2003. In 1931, Franklin D. Roosevelt, then governor of New York, called the factory “an excellent example of rural industrialism.”
Early ski hills, predating the rise of the commercial ski industry, a steam whistle from the Adams factory and a bootstrapping baseball team all help bring the past of Moscow back to life.
Though in recent years Moscow Road has become something of a shortcut for northbound visitors looking for the quickest way to Stowe Mountain Resort, the revival of Moscow commerce through businesses like the Sanfo Convenience Store and Carlson’s general store building have encouraged visitors to slow down a little, a historical evolution Hamilton has had a front row seat for.
“When (my wife) and I bought this house in the 1970s, this road was dirt, and we saw 50 cars a day,” he said. “Now, this being — we like to call it The Gateway to Stowe, because it is, there’s no question — now, during busy seasons, we see 5,000 cars a day.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Auditor Rob Sand confirmed Wednesday his office received a request to audit the Iowa Department of Education and state Board of Educational Examiners in relation to the 2023 licensing of former Des Moines Public Schools superintendent Ian Roberts.
Roberts, who was arrested by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement in September, did not have legal authorization to work in the U.S. and was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024.
Since his arrest, the Des Moines school board and district have faced significant scrutiny about why Roberts’ immigration status and previous criminal charges were not revealed during the hiring process. The school board is suing JG Consulting, the firm contracted in the search that led to Roberts’ hire, as these issues were not flagged, nor were other falsified portions of Roberts’ resume and credentials revealed by recent reports.
While Republicans and other critics have largely focused on the school district’s oversight of Roberts’ background, some Democrats have brought up questions over why this information was not flagged by the state when the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners granted Roberts an administrator license in July 2023.
On Wednesday, state Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, formally requested an audit of the Department of Education’s and BOEE’s licensing and background check procedures.
“Des Moines Public Schools are taking an appropriate step by requesting an audit from the State Auditor’s office, but the responsibility for transparency extends beyond DMPS,” Bisignano said in a statement. “Iowans deserve to understand how processes at the state level failed to identify this series of deceptions.”
Bisignano said he was “hopeful that an audit of the Board’s background check and licensing procedures will provide necessary accountability and begin to restore public trust.”
The auditor’s office confirmed it received Bisignano’s request Wednesday. Sand also confirmed last week his office had received a qualifying request to reaudit DMPS in light of Roberts’ arrest.
Earlier in October, state Sens. Jesse Green, R-Boone; Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, and Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, had sent a letter to Sand calling for an audit and investigation of DMPS in light of the Roberts’ situation, but Sand said their request was not valid. Under state law, Sand said a reaudit of the school district could only requested by a Des Moines school board member, DMPS staff, or through a petition with 100 signatures from people living within the district — and such a request was later received.
Sand had called the GOP lawmakers’ request an example of “partisan politics,” while highlighting their ability to request an audit of the BOEE.
“This is what legislators can request: They can request reviews of issues of spending by a state department with money from a state department. That’s it,” Sand said at the Oct. 14 news conference. “You’ll notice that none of them requested us to review what was going on with the Iowa (Board of) Education Examiners, who actually approved a license for Ian Roberts to teach. That might be partisan politics.”
On Wednesday, Sand released a statement saying Bisignano’s request was accepted while the Republican lawmakers’ request was denied because the Senate Democrat had requested an audit of a state entity.
“This request is unlike a request from legislators earlier this month to reaudit the Des Moines Public Schools, which is a governmental subdivision, and can only be reaudited at the request of an elected official or employee of the entity, or by petition from citizens per Chapter 11.6 of the Code of Iowa,” Sand said in the statement.
Gov. Kim Reynolds has also taken action to address the state role in licensing Roberts. She signed an executive order Oct. 8 requiring state government departments to verify immigration and citizenship status of people seeking occupational and professional licenses as well as state jobs using the federal E-Verify and SAVE systems.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, responding to a request about Roberts from U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, had stated Roberts’ immigration status would have been flagged through E-Verify, the federal web-based system used to check job applicants’ ability to work legally in the country. State entities will also check backgrounds using the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database, known as SAVE — the same database used by the Iowa Secretary of State’s office to check the citizenship status of registered Iowa voters.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sand.judicial1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:17:13.047946

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Louisiana residents who rely on the largest public food assistance program won’t get those benefits next month if the federal government shutdown continues, Gov. Jeff Landry said Wednesday in a news release.
More than 800,000 people in Louisiana receive benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as of this summer, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture figures. The agency has $6 billion in an emergency fund, leaving it about $3 billion short to cover the monthly cost of providing SNAP nationwide. 
Landry, a Republican, called on Democratic leaders in Congress to end the shutdown, which started Oct. 1. Democrats have held firm on insisting GOP lawmakers extend tax credits that help some 22 million people pay for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Senate Republicans have refused to return until Democrats agree to advance a stopgap spending bill. 
“The U.S. House under Speaker Mike Johnson has already acted to re-open the government. Our U.S. Senators representing Louisiana have voted over and over again to re-open the government. They are doing their part,” Landry said in his statement. “Now it is time for those U.S. Senators, under Democrat Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, to vote yes and re-open the federal government.”
The Louisiana Department of Health, which administers the state’s SNAP program, will begin notifying recipients this week that November benefits will not be added to their cards until the federal government reopens, according to the governor’s office. The state has also made placards for retailers that accept SNAP payments to display explaining to cardholders there will be no benefits added in November until the shutdown ends.
Pat Van Leo, executive director of Feeding Louisiana, said the governor’s announcement is “deeply concerning” for his organization. The five regional food banks in Louisiana it represents are pursuing emergency resources, including “potential state bridge funding,” to cover any gaps in SNAP benefits, he said.
“It will take all of us — lawmakers, businesses, faith and community organizations, and individuals — to ensure every family can eat,” Van Leo said in an email.
U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, was in the New Orleans area Wednesday and joined the staff at Second Harvest Food Bank to fill food packages for those in need, which he noted includes federal workers who’ve been furloughed during the shutdown..
“Taking away SNAP benefits from Louisiana families during the month of Thanksgiving is cruel,” Carter said in an email. “Yet our counterparts refuse to come to work and do their jobs to work with Democrats and keep the government open.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller)Addiction Recovery Care, or ARC, Kentucky’s largest provider of treatment and recovery services, has announced its pending sale to Ethema Health Corp., a Palm Beach, Florida-based behavioral health company.
ARC reported the potential sale in a news release Wednesday, saying the two companies have “entered into a letter of intent” for Ethema to acquire the assets and operations of ARC. It did not disclose the sale price.
Once the fastest-growing provider of addiction services in Kentucky, ARC has foundered over the past 14 months amid reports of an ongoing FBI investigation into possible health care fraud and closer scrutiny by insurers who process claims for patient care and had begun slashing reimbursement.
Over the past year, ARC has closed multiple facilities and programs and laid off several hundred employees. At its peak in 2024, ARC had about 1,800 residential treatment beds, programs throughout Kentucky and about 1,350 employees.
Medicaid — the government health plan for low-income individuals — pays for nearly all of ARC’s services, which include residential and outpatient care. ARC in 2023, received about $130 million in payments from Kentucky’s Medicaid program, which gets about 70% of its money from the federal government.
Tim Robinson, the founder and CEO of ARC based in his Eastern Kentucky hometown of Louisa, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But in an email Wednesday to ARC employees obtained by the Kentucky Lantern, Robinson said the sale was not “a decision we made lightly.”
“Following the necessary organizational changes, this strategic consolidation is the most responsible and forward-looking step we can take,” the email said. “It ensures the necessary long-term stability and investment required to continue our core mission: providing high-quality treatment for addiction and co-occurring disorders across Kentucky.”
He added that Ethema, operating under the name ARIA Kentucky, “has indicated a strong intent to hire a substantial portion of the current ARC staff in the same or similar roles. There will be no disruption to your daily operations or client care, as the well-being of our clients is our top priority,” Robinson said in his email to ARC employees.

Entities to be acquired by Ethema include ARC, the Bellefonte Hospital and Recovery Center, Pioneer Rural Health Clinic and a pharmacy and laboratory, Robinson’s email said.
The announcement makes no mention of the FBI investigation which the federal agency has described as “ongoing.”
But in an email Wednesday, an FBI spokeswoman suggested it may have been affected by the current federal government shutdown due to an impasse in Congress.
“During the current lapse in appropriations, (Department of Justice) operations are directed toward national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions,” the email said. “Inquiries outside of these functions will be considered when the lapse in appropriations ends.”
 The ARC news release did not disclose a potential sale price or whether Robinson would retain a role in the new operation and company officials did not immediately respond to questions about the deal.
Shawn Leon, owner of Ethema, said in the news release the purchase of ARC would advance the company’s goal of expanding addiction and recovery services in the region.
“This acquisition will significantly contribute to reaching our goal of building a network of 3,000 beds by the end of 2026 and solidifying ARIA Kentucky as a regional powerhouse in recovery services,” he said,
Ethema already operates the former Edgewater Recovery Center based in Morehead, whose previous owners came under federal scrutiny last year over alleged fraudulent billing practices. The company agreed to pay $2.2 million in a civil penalty for its role in a scheme to submit false laboratory claims to Medicaid and Medicare for drug testing, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky.
If the sale of ARC to Ethema goes through, it will bring to an end ARC’s 17-year operation by Robinson, a lawyer and recovering alcoholic who founded ARC in 2008 as a single halfway house in Lawrence County. He later established ARC’s headquarters in Louisa where it became the small town’s largest employer.
Over the years, the company grew rapidly, fueled by the changes in Medicaid in 2014 that dramatically expanded access for adults in need of addiction treatment, opening a new stream of revenue.
Robinson, his employees and companies affiliated with ARC, also became substantial political donors.

The Lantern reported last year that Robinson, his corporations and employees have made at least $570,000 in political contributions over the past decade as his for-profit company grew from a single halfway house to about 1,800 residential beds and outpatient care for hundreds more clients.
Among beneficiaries were Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat Robinson has said he thinks should run for president, but many political donations went to Republican candidates and causes.
Robinson also benefited.
The Lantern reported last year he and his wife, Lelia, received an annual income of about $533,400 a year, according to tax filings of a non-profit affiliated with ARC, Odyssey Inc.
Robinson said he didn’t think that unreasonable, given that he and his wife had worked and sacrificed to build the company.
“We took a lot of risks,” he said last year. “I’m living the American dream. I’m doing better than I ever thought I could be doing financially.”

(Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)South Carolina’s state-owned utility company is expected to take the next step toward rebooting a pair of partially-built nuclear reactors in the state.
The power company’s governing board is scheduled to meet Friday. On the agenda: a resolution related to “Completion of the AP1000 Nuclear Units in Fairfield County.”
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

It has been nine months since Santee Cooper put the call out to potential partners willing to restart construction on the failed reactor project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant.
Nearly 80 interested parties responded, more than 50 of which ultimately submitted a bid, CEO Jimmy Staton previously told the SC Daily Gazette. Those involved include large utility companies, investment banks and technology giants.
Now, the board is expected to take recommendations from the utility’s management team on how to proceed, according to a letter sent by Santee Cooper to state senators Tuesday. The letter said “additional steps” will still need to be taken before an agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding, is reached.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit in Fairfield County in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before spending $9 billion.
Gov. Henry McMaster wants SC to ‘usher in a nuclear power renaissance’

SCANA, SCE&G’s parent company, spiraled into bankruptcy and Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up what had been the only Fortune 500 company based in South Carolina.
As part of the buyout deal — approved by utility regulators at the end of 2018 — Dominion agreed to knock down what customers would ultimately owe for the reactors that have yet to produce a single megawatt.
“This is what I’ve been waiting over eight years for: to not only convert $9 billion of what many in July 2017 called a completely unrecoverable waste of money into a productive asset, but to do so in a way that assigns the cost of new power generation to the private (companies) driving the need for that new generation,” Sen. Tom Davis told the SC Daily Gazette.
The Beaufort Republican has championed the effort as a way for the state to meet its growing power needs, driven by residential and manufacturing growth, as well as an influx of technology companies that Davis referred to as “hyperscalers.” These tech giants, including Google and Facebook parent company Meta, have been building out energy-intensive data centers across the state needed to meet their vast computing needs.
Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

Neither Santee Cooper nor Dominion have interest in taking up the nuclear project again, which is why Santee Cooper has turned to outside developers.
Whatever group is ultimately chosen will need buyers for the power the plant produces, companies that can design, engineer and build it, and those that bring the financial wherewithal.
Dominion’s roughly 800,000 South Carolina customers still have a little less than 14 years before they pay off $2.3 billion worth of debt for the abandoned expansion.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, with customer payments expected to continue through at least 2032.
If a deal does get done, Santee Cooper customers still shouldn’t expect to see the cost of the plant come off their power bills, Staton has said. Instead, they’ll benefit from the electrons produced by a finished facility.
“Once the two reactors are completed, with private capital and at private risk, an additional 2,200 megawatts of carbon-free energy will come on line,” Davis said. “This new generation model can be replicated in future years to meet future needs. A source of shame will become a source of pride.”
This latest move follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.
And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2260-scaled-e1729033675632-1024x603.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:17:13.047946

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning)The next piece of the puzzle for the group hoping to get the U.S. Supreme Court to establish greater regulations on money in elections was laid on Wednesday. 
One of two expected appeals were filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston after a federal district court in July ruled that a 2024 Maine law overwhelmingly passed by voters was unconstitutional. The law placed limits on contributions to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates, commonly referred to as super PACs. 
The brief filed early evening Wednesday is from the committee behind the referendum, Republican-turned-independent state Sen. Rick Bennett and the nonprofit Equal Citizens, spearheaded by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig who has been attempting to bring this issue to the high court for years. Another is due from Attorney General Aaron Frey on behalf of the state of Maine by midnight. 
While Frey’s arguments are not yet known, those behind the referendum make the case in their brief that the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission actually allows for super PACs to be regulated and that a later decision that interpreted otherwise — and permitted unlimited spending by corporations — had misinterpreted the landmark ruling.
It’s an originalist, conservative legal argument, which is notable since the party that instigated the lawsuit is made up of conservative political action committees. Charles Miller of the Institute for Free Speech and Joshua Dunlap of Pierce Atwood filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Maine in 2024 on behalf of Dinner Table Action, which was founded by state Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) and activist Alex Titcomb, and For Our Future, which is run by Titcomb. They argue that the law restricts free speech.
These dueling arguments have been known, but in an interview ahead of the filing Wednesday Lessig told Maine Morning Star that the intervener’s brief also argues that a component of the recent district court opinion rejects the reasoning that served as the foundation for super PACs, aiding their case.  
After reviewing the filing on Wednesday, Miller said he disagrees. He’ll be issuing his full rebuttal on behalf of the plaintiffs next month.
Before then, friend of the court briefs are expected next week and could add additional layers to the argument. 
After oral arguments in early 2026, a ruling could come before the summer. 
Maine sued over new campaign finance law, but that was supporters’ plan all along

If the court decides in favor of the law, the issue could be in the Supreme Court by the fall of 2026. If the First Circuit rules otherwise, the path to the high court would become more difficult. 
How the district court opinion plays in
Since Buckley v. Valeo in 1976, the Supreme Court has allowed contributions to be regulated when there is a risk of “quid pro quo” corruption, essentially a favor for a favor. In the case of elections, if there is a risk someone could be making a donation to a candidate in exchange for a favor, then Congress can regulate that contribution. In 2010, the Supreme Court extended this reasoning to corporations and unions in Citizens United, ruling that those entities can otherwise spend unlimited amounts of money on elections because they have free speech rights under the First Amendment
Three months later, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in SpeechNow.org v. FEC that contributions to PACs cannot be regulated either, as long as the PAC is “independent” of the campaign. 
The interveners argue SpeechNow misinterpreted Citizens United. The ruling was never reviewed by the Supreme Court, though other lower federal and state courts agreed. In those cases, the courts ruled that contributions to independent political action committees created no risk of “quid pro quo” corruption, so they couldn’t be regulated. 
But in U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Frink Wolf’s opinion in the district court in July, she essentially conceded that there is a risk of corruption. “Contributions to independent expenditure PACs can serve as the quid in a quid pro quo arrangement,” she wrote. 
Lessig said that finding makes it “the most extreme opinion of any federal court in the history of this jurisprudence.” 
However, Frink Wolf went on to write, “I am not persuaded that the Defendants’ arguments on this point can be squared with Citizens United.”










The state of Maine is giving the Supreme Court a gift. You're saying to John Roberts, here's a case where you could decide this case and the whole country will say, ‘Huzzah.’


– Lawrence Lessig


That’s where she and Lessig diverge. 
The interveners are not seeking to change the limits on expenditures in Citizens United. They think the question the Maine referendum raises — whether contributions to a committee that makes independent expenditures can be limited — is not answered in Citizens United.
“Nothing in Citizens United or in any subsequent Supreme Court case disturbs the longstanding precedent securing to the people the power to prevent quid pro quo corruption or its appearance by limiting the size of contributions,” the brief reads.
Under the logic of Citizens United, independent expenditures are uncoordinated and create no risk of quid pro quo corruption, but donations to a committee that makes independent expenditures may or may not be coordinated. Therefore, the interveners argue, they create the risk of quid pro quo corruption and can be regulated by Congress.
“This case gives the courts a chance to correct a 15-year mistake, return power to the people, and begin restoring trust in our democracy,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star. 
Miller, the plaintiff’s lead counsel, disagrees with this interpretation.
“They’re trying to focus on the fact that, theoretically, a candidate could solicit a donation for independent expenditure, but the law doesn’t target that,” Miller said. “It targets any contribution for independent expenditure.”
As an example, Miller said someone could corrupt a politican by giving money to his daughter, “but there’s no reporting requirements on donations to daughters of senators.” In that regard, he added, “there are lots of things that can be corrupted, a donation to a presidential library arguably can be corrupted.”
An originalism argument 
The overarching point the interveners are trying to make is that the original meaning of the First Amendment would not have blocked state legislatures or the people from limiting the size of contributions to political action committees. 
“The Supreme Court has never considered the question of what the original meaning of the First Amendment means in the context of campaign finance jurisprudence,” Lessig said. 
In their brief, the interveners argue that founding-era history, the U.S. Constitution and precedent demonstrate that Maine’s interest in combatting “dependence corruption” — defined as “the improper dependence of public officials on deep-pocket interests that the Founders of our Republic viewed as anathema to our democracy” —  is sufficiently important to justify upholding limitations on contributions to SuperPACs.
The originalist argument they’re making is typically a conservative one, so Lessig believes it would fare well with the current conservative-leaning Supreme Court. He also believes that’s why the plaintiffs want to prevent that argument from advancing beyond the First Circuit. 
“That’s what gave us the new Second Amendment, that’s what overturned Roe versus Wade — it’s originalism,” Lessig said. “But here, it goes against their politics.”
Last week, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the group’s appeal. 
Ultimately, Lessig views the issue of regulating super PACs as a nonpartisan one. Both Republicans and Democrats benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars from super PAC spending last election, Democrats more so than Republicans. 
“The state of Maine is giving the Supreme Court a gift,” Lessig said. “You’re saying to John Roberts, here’s a case where you could decide this case and the whole country will say, ‘Huzzah.’”

(Courtesy of Utah Forward and United Utah parties)A Utah senator who left the Republican Party earlier this year to become the state’s first lawmaker to join the Forward Party of Utah has announced that he intends to resign before the 2026 legislative session set to begin in January. 
However, whether Sen. Dan Thatcher of West Valley City actually tenders his resignation depends on what happens over the next two months — and whether the Forward Party of Utah can actually pick his replacement through a district-wide preference poll or not. 
It would be the first situation of its kind in Utah, but it’s possible the new party could hit obstacles — including a potential challenge from the Utah Republican Party, of which Thatcher was a member of when he was last re-elected to represent Senate District 11 in 2022. 
Thatcher announced his plan to resign in a post on X on Tuesday night, saying he was “proud of the work I’ve done, the friends I’ve made, and for always keeping my word, no matter the cost or difficulty.”

“My first obligation is not to any political party, but rather to my constituents. To give them the best outcome, I am announcing my intention to resign prior to the next general legislative session,” Thatcher wrote. “In accordance with state law, the Forward Party and I will take this opportunity to carry out a first-of-its-kind, open and honest replacement process.” 
Thatcher’s divorce from the Republican Party earlier this spring came as Thatcher grew increasingly frustrated with the GOP, saying it’s become disconnected from Utahns and has strayed from true conservative and freedom-focused values. 
In recent years, Thatcher became no stranger to bucking his party’s line, especially on LGBTQ+ issues. Tensions rose between him and Republican legislative leaders, who reassigned Thatcher from his longtime committee assignments and moved his seat on the Senate floor to sit with Democrats. 
Additionally, Thatcher continues to deal with impacts from a stroke he suffered in 2022 — but Thatcher told Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday his health and clashes with Republican legislative leaders aren’t why he plans to resign before the end of his six-year term. 
He said far too often elections in Republican-dominated Utah are decided by closed primaries or, in the case of midterm vacancies, parties hand-picking their preferred candidate rather than elections open to all voters regardless of party affiliation. 
“Why am I doing this now? Because we have an opportunity,” Thatcher said. “This will be the first election I can think of that will actually be decided by … voters with different or in some cases no party affiliation. I think that is the No. 1 most important thing happening here, is this is going to be an election where everyone has a say. And I can’t think of a time when that’s happened.”

However, Thatcher said if for any reason the Forward Party of Utah isn’t able to proceed with its selection process, he’s prepared to change course, including not submitting his resignation letter to Senate President Stuart Adams and keeping his seat. 
“I fully intend to resign,” Thatcher said, but he added “if they force my hand then I am prepared with as many options on the table as possible.” 
Forward Party of Utah announces ‘open process’ to choose Thatcher’s replacement
The morning after Thatcher announced he planned to resign, the Forward Party of Utah issued a news release saying the party has unveiled a “groundbreaking plan” to fill Thatcher’s District 11 seat “through an open, voter-inclusive selection process, a first in Utah’s history.” 
With details outlined on 11chooses.com, party leaders envision District 11 voters will “securely cast their ballots online using a modern voting method that lets them choose multiple candidates they support.” 
Phil Boileau, spokesperson for the Forward Party of Utah, told Utah News Dispatch the party plans to conduct a “preference poll” that’s open to all District 11 registered voters, regardless of whether they’re Republican, Democrat, members of the Forward Party of Utah, or unaffiliated. 
To run, eligible District 11 residents would need to submit a declaration of intent by Nov. 11 and complete an application by Nov. 14. Boileau said candidates would need to pass a Forward Party background check, agree to sign a pledge supporting the Forward Party’s values, and commit to running for reelection in 2026 as a Forward Party candidate. 
He added that anybody already affiliated with a different party could change their party affiliation to the Forward Party of Utah by Nov. 11 in order to become an eligible candidate.

“If they do that, they qualify,” he said. “But you do have to be a member of the Forward Party to stand up as a candidate.” 
He said party leaders envision using an “instant runoff construct,” like ranked choice voting, approval voting or STAR voting, though party leaders haven’t decided which one yet. “We’re still getting feedback from our committee to decide which one we’re going to go with,” he said.
The main driver behind the Forward Party of Utah’s approach is that too many of Utah’s current legislators first took office through special party election processes, Boileau said. 
“Roughly one in four Utah legislators currently serving first assumed office through a closed-door, delegate-only special replacement process, where less than one percent of the voters in the district participate,” said Michelle Quist, chair of the Forward Party of Utah, said in a prepared statement.
Once in office, incumbents benefit from a “97% incumbency reelection rate,” Quist said. 
“Combine that with a closed primary system and ongoing efforts to ignore the will of the people by overturning Proposition 4, and a pattern emerges: Utah’s Republican supermajority has built a system designed to elect their political elite, and then protect them at all costs,” Quist said.
“The Forward Party is doing things differently,” she continued. “The unprecedented process we’re launching today gives the people of District 11, all of them, the power to decide who represents them. Parties don’t own these seats. People do.”
Potential hurdles
Whether the Forward Party of Utah is able to proceed with its never-before-used process could hinge on whether state leaders or the GOP intervene. 
Thatcher and Forward Party leaders believe Utah law is clearly on their side. When a midterm vacancy occurs in the Legislature, the law says “the governor shall fill the vacancy until the next regular general election by immediately appointing the person whose name was submitted by the party liaison of the same political party as the prior senator.”
The law, party leaders said, “gives leeway for the party to define its own replacement process.” 
When Thatcher was first elected, he was a registered Republican — up until he switched his party affiliation in March.

It’s not clear whether the Utah Republican Party will protest the Forward Party’s moves in coming months. When asked about that possibility on Wednesday, GOP Chair Rob Axson told Utah News Dispatch: “Excellent question, and not one I’m inclined to comment on.” 
However, Axson added: “I certainly believe that the people of the district, when casting a vote for a Republican, expected to be represented by a Republican.” 
If any challenges to the Forward Party of Utah’s selection process come to fruition, Boileau said the party will stand its ground. 
“We are prepared to fight this, if it comes to that,” he said. “We really, really hope that it doesn’t. Gamesmanship and holding up the courts is another mechanism of those in power that they can do to maintain the power. I’d like to let the people, for once, decide what they think is right and wrong.”

Democratic U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse and U.S. Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo all announced Wednesday afternoon that they intend to decline their paychecks until the federal government is reopened and public servants are paid.
Throughout the federal shutdown, all four congressional offices have remained fully open.  
Congressional pay is set by law and not subject to the annual appropriations process. Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution guarantees compensation for members of Congress.
The base salary for a U.S. senator and U.S. representative is $174,000 per year.
“It’s not clear to me they can force the Treasury to keep their money,” Roger Williams University School of Law Professor Peter S. Margulies said. “I’m not sure they have the power to do that.”
Margulies said congressional delegates could at least put their money into an escrow account or donate to a nonprofit aimed at helping federal workers.
“There are plenty of things they could do to show solidarity if their goal is they don’t want to pocket their pay,” he said.
Forgoing pay is an idea that’s being embraced by members of congress of both political parties. On Sept. 30, Democratic U.S. Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey requested that his pay be withheld. That same day, Republican U.S. Rep. Cat Kammack of Florida posted a copy of her request on X and U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma submitted her request.
Then on Oct. 1, the first day of the shutdown, Democratic U.S. Rep Janelle Bynum of Oregon submitted a letter to the House’s chief administrative officer requesting to have her pay withheld.
“Members of Congress should play by the same rules as the people they represent,” Bynum wrote. “I do not think it would be right for me to continue to be paid while many public servants in Oregon are not receiving their salaries through no fault of their own.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Kennedy of Utah introduced a bill that would prohibit members of Congress from receiving their pay during any period in which the federal government is shut down.
“This measure is about restoring fairness and accountability,” Kennedy said of his bill, titled “No Work, No Pay Act of 2025,” in a statement issued Oct. 1. “If we’re not going to pass a budget, we’re not going to fund the government, we shouldn’t get paid either. I just think that’s totally appropriate.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Some Iowa lawmakers have joined university faculty and student groups in speaking out against President Donald Trump’s new higher education compact, saying joining it would come with plenty of risks but “no benefits.”
Meanwhile, a former Iowa Board of Regents member leaving to join the Trump administration advocated in favor of the compact in his resignation letter to the governor.
Democratic members of the Iowa House of Representatives sent out a press release and letter addressed to the regents Wednesday urging the board to reject the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.”
“Iowa’s public universities are full of exceptional students, educators, and researchers,” said House Higher Education Committee Ranking Member Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, in the release. “We respect the faculty’s role in creating the great academic institutions we have today. The Board of Regents must protect those institutions and not put them at risk by signing onto a partisan agreement.”

Included in the compact are policies universities would have to follow in order to receive “benefits” of their relationship with the federal government, including different funding streams. These rules would require participating universities to freeze tuition for five years, restrict international student enrollment, publicize financial and other information and more.
Joining the compact wouldn’t benefit Iowa universities in any way, the Democrats’ letter stated, and would instead put at risk the “teachers, researchers, scholars, and students” whose contributions made the institutions as great as they are, as well as the positive impacts seen across the state from university research, educational opportunities and more.
As there are no specific rewards for joining listed in the compact and no set policies for violations, which could lead the U.S. Department of Justice as the overseeing body to strip all federal funding from institutions for at least one year, the letter stated Iowa’s universities would be left “vulnerable to subjective decisions from Washington, D.C.”
“Signing on to this President’s compact would not only undermine the quality and credibility of our research in the short term, but it would open us up to very precarious funding situations for the foreseeable future,” the letter stated. “Federal funding that flows to our state institutions must be based on the merit of proposed research and not political allegiance.”
The Democrats’ letter follows one from Republican lawmakers Rep. Taylor Collins and Sen. Lynn Evans calling for the board to embrace the opportunity. The Iowa Higher Education Coalition, made up of faculty and student unions at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and University of Northern Iowa, released a statement of its own Oct. 15 asking the board and universities to instead reject the compact.
David Barker, who resigned from the board of regents this week after being chosen as U.S. assistant secretary for postsecondary education, threw in his support for the compact in his own resignation letter to Gov. Kim Reynolds. He said in the letter he has advocated for the board to join the compact “since it was announced.”
“Our students deserve to learn about multiple points of view on critical issues so they can make informed decisions on matters of public concern,” Barker said in his resignation letter. “We must also ensure that our universities prepare students to enter Iowa’s workforce with the skills and knowledge needed in a rapidly changing economy.”
The new compact’s goals, as well as executive orders Trump has made while in office, align with those of the board and universities, Barker said in the letter.
Barker said in the letter he’s “proud” to have worked with board staff and Iowa’s public universities in his role as regent. However, institutions governed by the board should “ensure that our faculty is intellectually and philosophically diverse” if they want to maintain their strengths in enrollment, finances and academics and “achieve true academic excellence and freedom.”
Of the nine universities personally invited by Trump to join the compact before it was opened to all colleges in the U.S., around two-thirds of the group have declined, the Democrats’ letter stated, and other organizations have spoken against the compact and how it could change  higher education, including the Iowa Higher Education Coalition.
The letter encouraged the board of regents to “stand with the academic organizations and an increasing number of coalitions, cities, and individuals that have called on institutions to reject the President’s compact.”
“Graduates from Iowa’s universities are working in all 99 counties to develop new technologies, conduct vital research, and create and fill important jobs,” the letter stated. “Let’s focus on what we do well; let’s give our faculty and staff the freedom to educate young people and pursue important scientific discoveries free from political threats.”

John Fetterman’s fundraising woes continue,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/u-s-sen-john-fetterman-fundraising-woes-continue/,The Democrat posts lowest quarter since declaring bid for U.S. Senate in 2021.,"U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on March 6, 2024, in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman’s third quarter haul is his lowest fundraising total over a three-month stretch since he announced his candidacy for the office in February 2021.
From the beginning of July to the end of September, Fetterman’s campaign raised just under $330,000 and spent a little less than $575,000.
It’s the third consecutive quarter where Fetterman’s campaign spent more than it raised. His  campaign used $1.54 million, while gaining $1.23 million so far this year. At this point in 2024, his campaign raised $2.85 million, which is double the amount of his current 2025 totals.
During Fetterman’s successful run in 2022, he was a prolific fundraiser, bringing in $73.9 million on his way to flipping the open-seat blue over Republican Mehmet Oz.
Although Fetterman won’t be on the ballot until 2028, Christopher Borick, director of Muhlenberg College’s Institute of Public Opinion, said he believes his fundraising dip is “totally noteworthy.”
“It’s a sign of his tenuous position right now among his party’s financial supporters, who might have lots of questions about exactly where he’s at politically right now,” Borick said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Freshman U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) raised just over $890,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September, but he won’t be on the ballot until 2030.
Borick acknowledged Fetterman has time to improve his fundraising efforts for a 2028 bid, but the latest numbers are “an indication that he’s a bit in the wilderness in terms of his position of financial support,” and that could be a challenge.
Fetterman has been criticized by some Democrats, including several in the state’s congressional delegation, over statements and votes he’s made in support of President Trump’s policies, including being the only Democrat who voted to confirm several of his cabinet nominations, the administration’s immigration enforcement, and backing a GOP plan to fund the government.
A Quinnipiac University poll released on Oct. 1 showed that Fetterman has an 8 point net job approval rating, which is an improvement from its January poll that showed it was a 3 point net job approval rating. However, he holds a 41 point net approval rating among Republicans, while holding a 21 point net disapproval rating from fellow Democrats. Independents were split 43% to 43%.
This was a significant shift from their January poll that showed Fetterman with a 70 point net approval rating among fellow Democrats and a 59 net disapproval rating among Republicans.
A report from Axios earlier this month noted that U.S. Reps. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District), Chris Deluzio (D-17th District), and former Congressman Conor Lamb are potentially considering a primary challenge to Fetterman in 2028.
“It’s not surprising that they’re all probably spending some time and effort to discern the possibilities here, and one of them is to think about what they’ll need in finances, and what they’ll have in finances,” Borick said.
Boyle, who represents a safe seat based in Philadelphia, raised $610,000, which was the most of any Democratic incumbent in the state’s congressional delegation over the past three months. He entered October with $4.66 million on hand, which is more than any other incumbent in his party in the state’s U.S. House delegation.
Deluzio, who represents a more moderate district in western Pennsylvania, raised just over $415,000 in Q3 and entered July with just over $685,000 on hand.
And, although Lamb has not filed campaign finance reports since he’s not in office, Borick said, “it’s clear that Conor Lamb’s been out and about and keeping his name and face front and center in Pennsylvania politics over the last year.”
Fetterman entered October with $2 million on hand.

“He’s always had a unique brand, and that should not be underestimated,” Borick said. “His ability to connect with voters and kind of find his own path.”
“But ultimately, if he’s not able to, in a state that’s expensive to run in, like Pennsylvania, kind of turn this around, it could be a pretty big impediment for his chances at getting another term,” he added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fetterman-scaled-1-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:57:09.745050

Two months later, the girl was dead.","Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García’s mother reached out to Farmington school officials in late July 2024 with a short email alerting them of her intention to homeschool the 11-year-old.
“Hello I am contacting you today because I would like to homeschool my child for the upcoming school year thank you have a great day!,” Karla García wrote in the July 2024 email.
Less than two months later, the girl was dead, according to court documents. 
The child’s body was found in a plastic container in New Britain earlier this month. Documents show she was severely abused and starved. Police have arrested her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and her aunt in connection to her death.
[RELATED: Child posed as dead New Britain girl in meeting, DCF says]
The case has renewed calls for more regulation of Connecticut’s homeschooling system as well as scrutiny of the state Department of Children and Families. Documents from the two school districts García, the girl’s mother, emailed regarding her plans to educate her daughter show that the homeschooling plan likely hid abuse from people who would have been required to report it to the state.
The majority of reports of abuse and neglect statewide originate from school districts, according to DCF data. School employees are mandated reporters, meaning they are bound by law to report suspected abuse or neglect to the state.
García, who had been granted sole custody of Torres-García in June 2024, emailed the Farmington Public Schools on July 29, 2024 to tell them that her child would be homeschooled.
She later filled out a registration form to give the district more information including her home address, age and some academic history.
Torres-García attended kindergarten through fifth grade at the Consolidated School District of New Britain. Then on Aug. 26, 2024, her mother filled out a homeschooling form. The family would move to Farmington, Karla García indicated in the form.
By alerting both districts about her homeschooling plan, García made it less likely that any school officials would call to report educational neglect. If a child doesn’t show up to school without notice, school employees might make that report, school officials said.
Karla García told her sister that the child died on Sept. 19, 2024, about two months after she alerted school officials about homeschooling plans.
Torres-García’s younger sister attended Farmington schools briefly but was withdrawn, said Assistant Superintendent Dan Zittoun. According to court records, Torres-García also had siblings who are now 10 months old, 3 years old, 4 years old and 11 years old. 
Zittoun said if a child moves into their district and doesn’t register or tell the district they’re homeschooling and school staff had become aware of that child, they may call DCF and report educational neglect. Staff also get training on spotting signs of abuse, including signs of malnutrition.
He said in his professional judgment, he’d err on the side of caution and call DCF more readily. 
“If I’m asking the question, if I think there’s educational neglect, that’s enough for me to call DCF. You call DCF and you let them determine,” Zittoun said. “I err on that side of being conservative, of making calls.”
Zittoun said the decision to call isn’t always easy.
During the last legislative session, lawmakers held a forum to discuss the results of a report from the Office of the Child Advocate that found some families had been using homeschooling as a way to hide abuse.
The report was issued after news broke that a Waterbury man who was allegedly locked away by his stepmother for over a decade had been homeschooled. It found that Connecticut is one of only 12 states with “no meaningful regulation of homeschooling.”
Although lawmakers discussed methods to increase regulation of the system last session, none was ever brought to committee. Thousands of homeschool families rallied at the state Capitol to protest regulations.
Rep. Liz Linehan, D-Cheshire, has expressed concern about the lack of regulation for homeschooled children. 
“It was my position then, and it is my position now, that the law allows for abusive parents to exploit loopholes and unenroll their children from public school under the guise of homeschooling to prevent a DCF referral from the school if a child is being abused,” she said.
Diane Connors, of the Connecticut Homeschool Network, said on Wednesday that the issue of homeschooling was being unfairly blamed. 
“Until this state addresses the true systems failures instead of targeting homeschoolers as a deflection and scapegoat, it’s gonna happen again,” Connors said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:02:07.685002

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky’s two largest cities, the state attorney general and some environmental and industrial stakeholders are backing a proposed settlement of a rate-increase request by the state’s largest utility.
The settlement would scale back the requested increase in electricity rates for residential customers.
The proposed settlement submitted by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities (LG&E and KU) to state utility regulator Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) came after negotiations with a number of parties. 
The commission must approve the settlement which a group of nonprofits is opposing, saying it would allow the utility to bill customers for millions in construction costs without advance approval from the PSC. 
LG&E and KU President John Crockett in a published statement said “any increase to customers’ bills is impactful and not a decision we take lightly.” 
“Our employees, who are also our customers, work hard to operate and maintain our systems to be among the best in the nation. This agreement would allow us to continue making necessary system enhancements, upgrade aging equipment and enhance service for our customers,” Crockett said in his statement. 
The utility — which serves about 771,000 customers in Louisville, Lexington and more than 90 other counties — requested a rate increase earlier this year, saying the revenue is needed to replace or improve transmission, metering and information technology infrastructure. The Public Service Commission has held public hearings in Lexington and Middlesboro, with another hearing scheduled in Madisonville, to hear from ratepayers about the requested rate increase. 
Under its original request, the utility said monthly residential bills for KU and LG&E customers using an average amount of electricity would increase by about $18.15 and $11.04 respectively. Under the settlement, the utility says, the monthly increases would be $9 for KU and $5 for LG&E customers. The settlement would also specify that the utility would not seek another increase in rates until at least August 2028.
Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, the local governments of Lexington and Louisville, the Sierra Club, Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, the U.S. Department of Defense, Walmart and Kroger agreed to the proposed settlement. 
Coleman, the attorney general, said  in a press release that the settlement would “lock in” rates and is “a win on both fronts as we head into the winter months.” 
“This agreement keeps families’ residential rates low, but it also protects Kentucky’s competitive energy prices that encourage new economic investment and future job creation,” Coleman said.
A press release from The Sierra Club, an environmental organization, stated LG&E and KU had reduced its initial rate increase request after an “outcry at public hearings.” The  group criticized investments by the utility in fossil fuels-based technology, including gas-fired power plants and “aging coal plants” that are “bad for the climate and bad for our wallets.”
“While LG&E and KU’s settlement is a small step toward easing rate hikes, rates still go up, and those are real costs to everyday Kentuckians,” said Elisa Owen, the Beyond Coal Campaign senior organizer for the group in Kentucky. “People across our state are already choosing between heating their home, powering their lights, affording medication, or feeding their children.” 
“Like at the public hearings on these proposed rate increases, we will continue to show up and hold LG&E and KU accountable to serving Kentucky families first, not as an afterthought,” Owen said. 
Spokespersons for Lexington and Louisville did not immediately provide comment Wednesday on why the governments are backing the proposed settlement. 
But a group of nonprofits focused on housing, energy efficiency, renewable energy and advocating for low-income ratepayers is skeptical the settlement will keep rates stable into the future. Byron Gary, an attorney for the environmental legal group Kentucky Resources Council, is representing groups that did not agree to the settlement including Kentuckians For The Commonwealth, Kentucky Solar Energy Society, Metropolitan Housing Coalition and the Mountain Association. 
Gary in a statement said because of the addition of new “riders” in the settlement, the utility would be able to collect a higher return on investment from ratepayers than what is listed in the settlement and “pass through millions of dollars of construction costs for new electric units without advance review by the public and the commission of the prudency of those expenditures.” 
“The total costs of these additions largely offsets any settlement savings, and if approved, ratepayers will continue to see their actual rates rise despite the supposed lock in,” Gary said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5813-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-22 18:02:07.685002

Oklahoma Head Start centers face ‘dire’ funding loss from government shutdown

In response, members of the United States House of Representatives, including U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, recently introduced legislation to “permanently establish and protect” the programs under the Office of Head Start and its 12 regional offices, according to a news release. The bill follows the closure of at least five regional Head Start offices earlier this year.
U.S. Reps. André Carson (D-Indiana) and Jahana Hayes (D-Connecticut), cosponsored the bill.
In a statement, Leger Fernández said the Every Child Deserves a Head Start Act ensures “no president can gut the very programs that help families rise,” and protects federal staff and child care workers.
“Head Start opened doors for me and millions of children like me,” Leger Fernández said in a statement. “It gave us an equal chance to dream and learn while nourishing our mind and body. The Trump Administration’s attempt to dismantle Head Start is cruel and short-sighted. We must protect our kids from these partisan attacks.”
Concerns for the 60-year old program began mounting in April, when efforts to eliminate the program resurfaced and several Head Start providers and parent associations filed a lawsuit against the federal government’s efforts to demolish Head Start programs.
Concerns mount over Head Start programs for children 

About 10%, or 134 programs, face closure if they do not receive operating funds due on Nov. 1, while others are already on shaky ground since the Oct. 1 federal government shutdown, according to the National Head Start Association.
New Mexico could face a loss of 250 slots and 76 Head Start teachers and staff on Nov. 1, according to a map released Wednesday.
The New Mexico Head Start Association and teaching union National Educational Association endorsed the new legislation Wednesday.
President of New Mexico Head Start Association Patricia Grovey Evans said in a statement Leger Fernández’s legislation would “restore the regional support that our programs so deeply need.”
Bethany Jarrell, the president of NEA-New Mexico, said the teacher’s union “always supports giving every child a hand up and a strong start. That’s why we proudly stand behind the Every Child Deserves a Head Start Act, which ensures our youngest learners have the foundation they need to thrive.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.

Unilever, the owner of Ben & Jerry’s, announced Tuesday that, due to the federal government shutdown, the conglomerate would postpone the creation of a spinoff company that would operate the Vermont brand.
The announcement was welcomed by the ice cream company’s founder, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who the previous day had redoubled their campaign of public pressure to “free” their former company from what they say is Unilever’s corporate censorship.
As the Unilever spin-off — The Magnum Ice Cream Company — takes shape and prepares to become the new owner of Ben & Jerry’s, Cohen and Greenfield have protested in court and in personal statements that Unilever inappropriately intervened in the ice cream maker’s political positions. The new company is set to be overseen by the same executives and with the same “stifling” leadership as Unilever, Cohen said last month.

Unilever has repeatedly stated that Ben & Jerry’s is not for sale. In their most recent email communication to supporters, Cohen and Greenfield targeted the upcoming Unilever spinoff and its initial public offering as an opportunity for supporters to contact the corporation’s board directly and demand that it grant Ben & Jerry’s operational independence. 
The conglomerate’s alleged suppression of Ben & Jerry’s activism has come in relation to “issues such as Gaza, indigenous rights, the Trump administration, and DEI,” the founders said in an open letter last month.
A spokesperson for Unilever said Wednesday that the company’s delay was not related to recent clashes with Cohen and Greenfield. Tuesday’s announcement attributed the decision to the federal government shutdown. The company said in a statement that the demerger is on track and the spinoff should happen by the end of the year. 
The update comes amid national concern about how public offerings will proceed given the skeletal operation of the federal government . The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently unable to process necessary evaluations for companies seeking to sell shares on the stock exchange, leaving companies like The Magnum Ice Cream Company in limbo until the government reopens.
“If the SEC cannot do its job, then either the company may say we’re not willing to (launch a public offering), or the company may not legally be able to do it,” said Andrey Ukhov, a professor at the University of Vermont’s Grossman School of Business. 
Ukhov said while the shutdown is reason enough to postpone the demerger, the attention  created by the founders will likely not be beneficial for the deal. The possibility of continued legal action from the founders, as well as a potential to see decreased sales, could be “value diminishing” for the new company as it seeks investors, he said.
“Magnum’s upcoming IPO in early November means the silencing is set to continue,” Monday’s email from the founders said. The founders directed their supporters to a “Sign the Letter” page that includes language about withholding patronage from Ben & Jerry’s if the company is not granted independence. The letter was addressed to The Magnum Ice Cream Company’s CEO and board members.
Cohen welcomed the company’s shutdown-related delay on Tuesday.  
“Good,” he said in a statement on X. “It gives us a real shot to free Ben & Jerry’s.”

Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, in a lawsuit where the city of Lansing is seeking to shut down a homeless encampment on the north side of the city, will allow the lawyer for defendant JAJ Property LLC, Stephen Ogilvie, to present evidence that he claims the city both pushed unhoused residents from other areas of the city onto property owned by the defendant and refused to provide assistance to clear the area when asked. 
Aquilina has been holding weekly hearings in her courtroom at the Ingham County Courthouse — and this week, Ogilvie sought a motion to set aside a default judgment issued in mid-September that required the camp to be cleared within 60 days. The city’s lawyer in the hearing, Matthew Staples, did not agree to the motion. 
In the hearing that followed, conflicting arguments from both Ogilvie and Staples led Aquilina to go into an offer of proof and set a hearing that would allow both sides to present evidence and call witnesses. 
“What I’m going to be able to prove is that it was the City of Lansing, through the Lansing Police Department, that directed unhoused individuals from other encampments and other places into the city, onto this property,” Ogilvie said, adding that he had records of at least a dozen requests to the city and police department asking for help in managing and clearing the property. He added that he also has videos of encampment residents explicitly stating that Lansing Police Department officers directed them to go to that area.

Staples responded, saying that Ogilvie’s statements were “wild speculation.” He added that the city had reached out to the defendant in April with a plan to clear out the encampment area and connect the people living there with social services — but did not hear back for months.
Aquilina responded to Ogilvie’s allegations, saying, “This is a problem.” 
As she concluded the hearing, the judge instructed Staples to ensure that city officials and police clearly understood that directing unhoused residents to specific parks or other areas was not allowed. Staples had argued that the actions of one individual officer should not be taken as city policy. 
Ogilvie and Staples also disagreed on whether the defendant had presented enough of an argument to set aside the judgment.
Staples argued that, to set aside a judgment such as this one, Ogilvie would have had to show “good cause and a meritorious defense.”  
“The law in Michigan is clear that if a zoning violation exists upon your property, it is a nuisance per se,” he said to dispute the meritorious defense. “I don’t know what evidence they’re possibly going to discover that’s going to show that this encampment does not exist on their property. The court has been there and has seen it.”
But Ogilvie argued that another basis for overturning the judgment is “manifest injustice” — which he argued that the city’s alleged actions amounted to. 
“What could be more unjust, if the city created this problem, and then the city refused to help us do it, and then the city sued us and tried to make us pay for their wrongful conduct?” he asked Aquilina.

Staples also provided Aquilina with an update on getting the encampment residents access to social services and other placements. 
“I heard today that they’ve gotten pretty much everyone there their paperwork completed and gotten them into the system,” he said, adding that 38 people were actively working with caseworkers. While the encampment’s population had peaked around 60 people, he said that he believes that as of now, this number represents the vast majority of those currently living there. 
As for Aquilina’s November deadline to have the park cleared, she said, “that’s going to be extended unless we have answered every single person, and there’s no more human beings on there. If I haven’t been clear about that before, I’m being clear about it now.”
“I’m going to do an extension for another 90 days, and then another 90 days until human beings are taken care of,” she added.
The hearings for the offer of proof were tentatively scheduled for the week of Dec. 15, with both lawyers agreeing to those dates. Aquilina will also continue to hold her weekly meetings at the courthouse.

The Vermont Conversation with David Goodman is a VTDigger podcast that features in-depth interviews on local and national issues. Listen below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get podcasts.



They are being described as possibly “the biggest ever mass demonstrations in American history.” More than 7 million people participated in No Kings protests on Saturday, October 18 across more than 2,700 events in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and in cities around the world.
In Vermont, organizers estimate that some 43,000 people participated in more than 40 events around the state. People came out to protest the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants, LGBTQ+ rights, public education, the government shutdown and more.
At the Vermont State House, where some 6,500 people gathered in cool fall weather, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., fired up the crowd with a call to fight back against President Donald Trump’s authoritarianism. Then she talked about the hero’s journey, an archetype in mythology and narrative storytelling (think Star Wars and the Hunger Games) that involves an ordinary person who faces a challenge, embarks on a journey, triumphs over adversity and returns transformed.

“I know that many of you feel anxious, you feel scared, you feel overwhelmed,” Balint told the crowd. “We have to see this as part of a hero’s journey that we are all on together. We must shift our thinking into believing that we, each of us, embody that hero is going to lead us to a better day. And what I know is the first step on the hero’s journey is answering the call. And that is what you have done today. You are answering the call.”
Asked about the deepening impact of the federal shutdown, Balint told the Vermont Conversation, “Millions of people are at risk of losing their health care, and we know that health care right now is one of the things that is making it incredibly emotionally, psychologically, economically devastating for families. We have to fight for health care, and we also have to say to this President, No, you will not bully us into submission. We’re not going to sell out our people back home because we’re afraid of your wrath.”
Millions of Americans are receiving notices of soaring health care premiums as Congress remains deadlocked over extending Covid-era subsidies, as demanded by Democrats. Premiums will rise by 18% on average, according to the nonpartisan health policy group KFF.
Sen. Peter Welch advised Vermonters to hang in there. “We don’t know how this is going to end, but we know that the only real chance it has to end well is if we show that we are committed to democracy and we’re willing to act together.”

Welch said that Trump sending troops to cities led by Democrats is “just a lawless exercise. It’s a prelude to him potentially sending troops in if he doesn’t like the vote outcome in the next election.”
I asked Paul Burns, an attorney and the longtime executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, whether he believed the legal system was up to the task of defending democratic institutions.
“We’re seeing a Supreme Court where decisions appear no longer based on legal principles or court precedents,” he said. “The court has no compunction about turning its back on long standing principles on any sense of consistency under the law. Absent that, we have to wonder whether the law can be there for us in any way that it has been in the past. And so I am deeply concerned.”
Burns said that what gives him hope is “looking over at my 14 year old son and he and other young people who bring to this an earnestness and an openness and interest in just living their lives in a free way, a belief still that we can and must have a democracy here. They are not tainted or jaded or cynical.” He vowed to do “everything that I can to try to make this better.”

Clara White, a 14-year-old eighth grade student from Montpelier, had a distinctive voice and message among the lineup of politicians and activists. She said that “people my age, we are not just sitting around waiting. We are more connected than generations before us. We care about each other. We know how to share information, organize online and learn from people all over the world. We are creative problem solvers because we have had to be.”
She cited examples of of how young people in her community “started a Green Up Day program, came together to feed families in need, and volunteered at a summer camp to help other girls feel empowered.”
“I choose hope because I’ve seen what happens when people come together. I choose hope because giving up is not an option. I choose hope because I believe in us.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Surrounded by scaffolding, fencing, and construction equipment, the Federal Building and Courthouse at the east end of Providence’s Kennedy Plaza was quiet during lunch hour Wednesday afternoon.
That somewhat reflected the quiet inside the building, which houses Rhode Island’s U.S. District Court, where officials have begun scaling back operations amid the ongoing federal government shutdown. A disclaimer posted Monday on the court’s website states it no longer has sufficient funding to sustain full, paid operations.
“During this period, the court will maintain only those operations necessary to carry out its constitutional and statutory duties,” the notice states. “While certain functions will continue, members of the public, the bar, and litigants may experience reduced operations, limited staffing, and potential delays in some services.”
U.S. District Court Chief Deputy Clerk Frank Perry told Rhode Island Current Wednesday that court officials have already started to make some changes.
“Civic outreach, training, tours, naturalizations, and other activities that do not support those operations necessary to carry out our constitutional and statutory duties will be curtailed during the lapse,” he wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current.
Even approval for the media to take photographs inside the building is impacted by the shutdown. “This would have to be coordinated after the budget impasse is resolved, as the coordination of this doesn’t necessarily fall within an excepted activity,” Perry said.
The clerk’s office, for now, will still accept all civil and criminal filings and continue regular administration of the jury and grand jury system. Even work on the ongoing renovations of the Exchange Terrace building’s exterior, still partially covered with scaffolding, will continue amid the shutdown, Perry said.
Perry deferred to the U.S. General Services Administration for comment on the exterior work. A spokesperson acknowledged a request from Rhode Island Current but did not send an official response.

If the shutdown continues, Rhode Island’s court may have to halt review of the several high-profile lawsuits filed against the Trump administration, Roger Williams University School of Law Professor Michael Yelnosky warns. 
“Criminal matters have to get first priority because of statutory and constitutional protections to which defendants are entitled,” Yelnosky said in an email to Rhode Island Current Wednesday.
When the federal shutdown began Oct. 1, the nation’s judiciary branch was able to keep existing operations afloat through a small fund derived from case filing fees and leftover funding carried from previous years. 
But last Friday, the federal judiciary announced that funding had run out. As a result, it would no longer be able to continue its paid operations after Monday, effectively leaving the decision on how to proceed in the coming days and weeks to individual courts.
U.S. Supreme Court, federal courts to run out of money, limit operations amid shutdown

“In some districts, courts have delayed proceedings in civil cases, including civil cases pending against the Trump administration, because of the impact of the government shutdown not only on the courts’ resources but the resources of the Justice Department, which is defending the administration in those cases,” Yelnosky wrote.
So far, that worst case scenario hasn’t hit federal courthouses in New England, though the effects of the shutdown vary.
Much like Rhode Island, federal district courts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire issued notices stating “operations necessary to carry out its constitutional and statutory duties” will remain ongoing and that all cases will continue as scheduled.
Courts in Maine and Vermont both issued notices stating that they will remain open during normal business hours and that all cases would proceed as scheduled.
Federal judges in Connecticut too will continue to hear cases, but the clerks will no longer work on Fridays.
“Although all employees are deemed to be performing excepted activities, the Court recognizes that not all employees are needed to report for duty every day during the shutdown,” states an Oct. 16 administrative order by Chief Judge Michael P. Shea of the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.
Rhode Island has emerged as one of Democrats’ key legal battlegrounds. Attorney General Peter Neronha is leading or has joined 38 cases against the Trump administration, with over a dozen filed in Rhode Island. 
The Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed five cases — four grant certification cases and one habeas petition — in the state’s federal courthouse.
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said he’s yet to notice any broad impacts to the court caused by the shutdown.
“What is most important is that the court will be open to hear and rule on cases, and in that regard we are hopeful that the shutdown won’t significantly affect the court’s ability to address requests for emergency relief expeditiously,” Brown said.

Lauren Stokes, a former executive assistant in the University of Mississippi’s development office, said she was terminated over a social media post she endorsed on her private Instagram account about Kirk, the right-wing activist and CEO of the political organization Turning Point USA. 
University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce fired Stokes over speech that is constitutionally protected, even if it was offensive, her attorney argued in a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
“A private employer might require its employees to conform to a point of view but the state acting through its public university cannot,” wrote attorney Allyson Mills. “After all, today’s policed are tomorrow’s policemen. No state institution should purport to wield such power.”

On Sept. 10, Kirk was assassinated while speaking on a college campus in Utah. That night, Stokes reposted to her Instagram account a statement made by another person that lambasted Kirk’s views on issues like guns, abortion and race.
“For decades, yt (white) supremacist and reimagined Klan members like Kirk have wreaked havoc on our communities, condemning children and the populace at large to mass death for the sake of keeping their automatic guns,” the statement said. “They have willingly advocated to condemn children and adult survivors of (sexual assault) to forced pregnancy and childbirth. They have smiled while stating the reasons people who can birth children shouldn’t be allowed life-saving medical care when miscarrying. They have incited and clapped for the brutalizing of Black and Brown bodies. So no, I have no prayers to offer Kirk or respectable statements against violence.”
The post generated immediate backlash for Stokes, who deleted the post and apologized hours after publishing it. That same night, Boyce happened to dine at a restaurant owned by Stokes and her husband, the complaint says. 
By the next morning, a social media firestorm had kicked into high gear, with conservative activists and even some state leaders drawing Stokes’s post to her employer’s attention. That mirrored similar episodes around the country in the days after Kirk’s killing.
Journalists and teachers have been fired for their comments on his death, with several conservative activists seeking to identify social media users whose posts about Kirk they viewed as offensive or celebratory. 
The University of Mississippi placed Stokes on administrative leave around 9 a.m. on Sept. 11, according to the complaint.
A little under four hours later, Mississippi State Auditor Shad White, a vocal critic of what he calls “woke” initiatives in higher education, posted about the episode on X.
“To Ole Miss, did an Ole Miss employee just repost this insane reaction to Charlie Kirk’s murder? Answer,” White wrote.
About an hour after that, university officials fired Stokes, according to her complaint. Then, 20 minutes later, Boyce released a statement that didn’t name Stokes, but confirmed her firing and called her comments “hurtful” and “insensitive.”
“The comments run completely counter to our institutional values of civility, fairness and respecting the dignity of each person,” Boyce said. “We condemn these actions and this staff member is no longer employed by the university.”
In Stokes’s legal complaint, her attorney points out that the speech in question “related to a subject of obsessive news interest” and was not even hers, but someone else’s that she reposted. 
“By terminating Lauren for reposting the speech, the University says that Lauren is not allowed even to agree with a point of view held by a substantial portion of the nation,” the complaint said. “Stated differently, the University says it gets to tell its employees what to think on matters of public concern. The interests in freedom of speech, indeed of thought, are extraordinarily high here.”
Stokes said she has received death threats and bomb threats against her restaurant that forced it to close for two weeks. She is seeking damages, legal fees, and a declaration that Boyce violated her First Amendment rights.

University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce fired Stokes over speech that is constitutionally protected, even if it was offensive, her attorney argued in a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
“A private employer might require its employees to conform to a point of view but the state acting through its public university cannot,” wrote attorney Allyson Mills. “After all, today’s policed are tomorrow’s policemen. No state institution should purport to wield such power.”

The trial, however, won’t commence until this time next year.
Lee and Stephanie Chatfield had a pre-trial hearing on Wednesday in Ingham County Circuit Court, in which the defendants waived their right to a speedy trial. The trial is now set for Sept. 21, 2026, through Oct. 9, 2026.
The court’s record notes that the year-out timeline was the earliest the trial could be set due to defense scheduling conflicts.
Attorney General Dana Nessel and her department have alleged that Lee and Stephanie Chatfield funneled money from their political nonprofit accounts to fund a lavish lifestyle, and will stand trial for embezzlement and other charges related to their activities.
The pair was bound over to the circuit court in May.
Nessel announces criminal enterprise charges against former Speaker Chatfield and his wife

The Department of Attorney General’s case against the Chatfields asserts that, beginning in 2021, the couple allegedly used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at luxe stores like Coach, items at amusement parks like Universal Studios, while Lee Chatfield also spent lavishly at strip clubs and partied with his associates and brothers.
An investigation into Chatfield began after his former sister-in-law reported to Lansing police an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting when she was 14 or 15 years old. 
Michigan State Police probed the allegations and found evidence of potential financial improprieties – an investigation that was later taken over by Attorney General Dana Nessel. 
However, her office did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges for criminal sexual conduct against Lee Chatfield, but it did allow the office to charge him with 13 felony counts for conducting a criminal enterprise, conspiracy and embezzlement. Stephanie Chatfield faces two felony counts.

She joined 3,200 other union members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who went on strike at midnight on Aug. 4 to get better wages and retirement plans (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).Democrat and Republican U.S. senators voiced their outrage during a committee hearing Wednesday that Boeing cut off health care to 3,000 striking workers at its St. Louis-area facilities.  
And they accused the world’s largest aerospace company of failing to offer its workers a fair contract. 
“This is really unbelievable,” said Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, during a meeting of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
Josh Arnold, a union member from St. Louis and coordinator for a Boeing program that supports the U.S. Navy’s FA-18 Super Hornets fighter aircraft, told the committee that the workers have been on strike for 12 weeks demanding wage increases and better retirement benefits.
Arnold, who is also a union shop steward for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837, said the cost difference between the company’s offer and union’s ask is half the cost of one F-15 fighter jet. 
“We’re going to blow our shoulders out drilling on titanium for four years to make 96 F-15s,” Arnold said, noting that they’ll also make a number of other fighter jets, weapons, launch systems and flight simulators. “We’re saying we’re going to deliver all of that to you. We want a fraction of 1% of one of the programs. And that’s when [the company] said, ‘Cut your health care. Get back to work.’”
Josh Arnold, a union member from St. Louis and coordinator for a Boeing program that supports the U.S. Navy’s FA-18 Super Hornets fighter aircraft, told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday that the workers have been on strike for 12 weeks demanding wage increases and better retirement benefits (Screenshot of streamed hearing).
On Wednesday afternoon after the hearing, Boeing announced a new settlement offer, which decreases parts of the company’s original offer that led to the strike that began on Aug. 4. The new offer followed two days of meetings with a federal mediator and union negotiators. 
The union responded in a statement, “We’ve said it many times, and we’ll say it again: we will not vote on an insulting offer.”
At the Senate committee hearing, Hawley said Boeing’s stance in the Missouri strike negotiations reflects how the company has been “stripmined for parts” from what it used to be.
“This is a company whose planes have literally been falling out of the sky in pieces in recent years,” Hawley said. “Why is that? I think we all know why. Because they won’t commit to safety standards. They won’t pay their workers well, but they pay their CEO and their C-suite more than ever before.”
Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts echoed Hawley’s criticism, saying the company’s “union busting is a threat to aviation safety.”
“Over the last 30 years, Boeing has transformed from a company known for safety excellence to a company with its safety record in shambles,” Markey said. “At the same time, the company, which was once working in partnership with its unions, has turned hostile.” 
Markey said the company’s refusal to agree to a fair contract with striking machinist workers “makes you wonder how Boeing can ever expect to restore its safety culture.”
Independent U.S. Bernie Sanders of Vermont asked Arnold what message it sends workers when the company’s CEO earns $18 million for four months but says they don’t have enough money to negotiate a fair contract with the workers “producing some of the most sophisticated fighter planes in the world.”
“It tells us that they don’t value us,” Arnold said. “It tells us that they’re seeking to maximize shareholder value by limiting inputs like wages for laborers. That’s us. We produce the value, but we don’t get any piece of that value, or as little of a piece as they can allow to get by with.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2949-scaled-e1757539013206-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-10-22 17:17:22.716330

Free.,"Shutdown on day 22 sets record as second-longest in US history, with no sign of a deal",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-day-22-sets-record-second-longest-us-history-no-sign-deal,,"WASHINGTON — The government shutdown became the second longest in U.S. history Wednesday, though the mounting repercussions for dozens of federal programs, including food aid for some of the country’s most vulnerable residents, failed to spur any momentum in Congress. Leaders opted to remain in their political silos, just as they have since before the shutdown began 22 days ago. They’ve repeatedly held press conferences and meetings with their own members instead of making the types of compromises needed to keep government functioning on the most basic level. Republican leaders are waiting for Democrats to help advance the stopgap spending bill in the Senate and say they won’t negotiate on anything until after that happens. Democrats maintain they won’t support the House-passed continuing resolution until there is bipartisan agreement to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The government staying shut down much longer will lead to a funding shortfall for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is relied on by 42 million low-income Americans, nearly 40% of them children younger than 17. The tensions were on full display on the Senate floor, where Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley spoke for nearly 23 hours about his concerns and objections to President Donald Trump’s administration.Johnson warns funding process at riskThe stalled short-term spending bill is supposed to give lawmakers more time to work out agreement on the dozen full-year government funding bills, which Congress was supposed to pass by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year. But Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., warned during a morning press conference that lawmakers may scrap that process for a second year in a row if Democrats don’t advance the continuing resolution soon. “We’re getting closer to November. It is going to be more and more difficult with each passing hour to get all the appropriations done on time,” Johnson said. “We acknowledge that, but we have to do this on a day-by-day basis.”House Democratic leadership dismissed the notion of a longer temporary spending bill or continuing resolution, possibly for a full year, during an afternoon press conference. Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, of Massachusetts, said her message to Republicans is, “Why are you talking about the length of the (continuing resolution)? Come to the table and negotiate with us. End this health care crisis, help the American people.""Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries sidestepped specifics when asked about a longer stopgap funding bill.“At this point, we need to reopen the government. We need to enact a spending bill that actually meets the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety and economic well-being, particularly in terms of driving down the high cost of living, while at the same time decisively addressing the Republican health care crisis that grows greatly by the day,” the New York Democrat said.Lawmakers have been unable to approve all the annual funding bills on time since 1996 and have consistently relied on stopgap spending bills to give themselves more time to work out agreements between the House and Senate. The alternative to full-year government funding bills is to use a series of stopgap spending bills, or one that lasts the entire year that keeps spending mostly on autopilot. Either option requires bipartisanship to gain the support of at least 60 senators, since Republicans control 53 seats. That means the only solution to the shutdown is for Republican and Democratic leaders to compromise. But that seemed like a remote possibility Wednesday. Democrats criticize layoffsHouse Democrats’ Steering and Policy Committee held a mock hearing where they railed against Republicans and Trump for how they’ve managed unified control of government. House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., rebuked Trump administration officials for trying to lay off federal workers by the thousands and for canceling funding to projects in regions of the country that vote for Democrats. “It is a corrupt abuse of power that they have chosen to carry out,” DeLauro said. White House budget director Russ Vought and Trump, she said, “have launched a scorched earth campaign to decimate the federal government and the programs and services the American people depend on.”Rob Shriver, managing director of the civil service strong and good government initiatives at Democracy Forward, who worked as deputy director at the Office of Personnel Management during the Biden administration, said the layoffs could negatively affect federal operations for years. “The government has had historic challenges in recruiting young people and recruiting tech talent, and what this administration is doing is turning it into a workforce that doesn’t try to recruit the best and the brightest, but that tries to recruit the most loyal,” Shriver said. Lawsuit gains more unionsThe Trump administration’s efforts to lay off thousands of workers during the shutdown have been on hold since last week, when a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that was later expanded.  The lawsuit was originally brought by the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. It expanded last week to include the National Federation of Federal Employees, the National Association of Government Employees and the Service Employees International Union.The updated restraining order issued by U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston applies to any federal department or agency that includes employees represented by those unions, even if the Trump administration doesn’t recognize their contracts. Illston on Wednesday granted a request to add the National Treasury Employees Union, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and American Federation of Teachers to the case. Illston wrote that she found “good cause exists to modify the existing TRO without a written response from defendants due to the emergency nature of this case.” Those three unions represent hundreds of thousands more federal workers, including those at the departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, Justice and Veterans Affairs. Employees at the Environmental Protection Agency, Internal Revenue Service, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Social Security Administration are also represented by the three new unions seeking to join the case. The next stage in the lawsuit comes on Oct. 28, when the judge has set a hearing to determine whether to issue a preliminary injunction in the case. 'Patently illegal'AFGE National President Everett Kelley wrote in a statement released Wednesday that the “administration’s move to fire thousands of patriotic civil servants while the government is shut down is patently illegal, and I’m glad we are able to expand our lawsuit to protect even more federal workers from facing termination.”“President Trump has made no secret that this is about punishing his political enemies and has nothing to do with the actual work that these employees perform,” Kelley added. “Data provided by the administration under court order illustrates how vast and unlawful these intended firings are and validates our union’s determination to challenge this illegal action.”Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-10-22 17:17:22.716330
,DC,2025-10-22 20:56:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Education Department layoffs illegally burden students with disabilities, advocates say",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/education-department-layoffs-illegally-burden-students-disabilities-advocates-say,,"WASHINGTON — Proposed mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education have raised alarm among disability advocates and Democratic lawmakers over the potential impact on millions of students with disabilities. Advocates warn that the department cannot carry out its legally mandated functions for special education services and support at the staffing levels put forward by President Donald Trump’s proposed reduction in force, or RIF. The agency is also reportedly weighing a transfer of special education programs to a different department. “If we’ve learned anything this year, it’s that the fight is just beginning,” Rachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, told States Newsroom. “And we’re going to do everything we can to fight these illegal firings and the dismantling of the department, but it is just beginning.”Trump’s administration took another axe to the department earlier this month amid the ongoing government shutdown, effectively gutting key units that serve students with disabilities. The affected offices administer $15 billion in formula and discretionary grant programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, provide guidance and support to families and states and investigate disability-based discrimination complaints, among other responsibilities. Though a federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration from carrying out the layoffs, the ruling provides only short-term relief as legal proceedings unfold. The administration moved to lay off 465 department employees, including 121 at the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, or OSERS, 132 in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, or OESE, and 137 in the Office for Civil Rights, or OCR. The layoffs also hit the Office of the Secretary, Office of Communications and Office of Postsecondary Education. “You can’t look at any of this in a silo,” Gittleman said. “When you’re thinking about special education specifically, you also have to think about the fact that OESE, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, also saw an almost full RIF as well.” Gittleman called the civil rights office “the place that ensures families have a place to go for help when students are denied access for education based on their disability.”“That was also almost entirely gutted,” she said. “So you’re debilitating these programs in multiple ways because ... kids with disabilities benefit from OESE programs, OCR assistance and OSERS programs.” Those three units had already been hit with a separate set of department layoffs earlier this year. Parents as advocatesKaty Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, said that while IDEA has not been changed and the rights of children with disabilities continue, the government’s ability to enforce and implement those rights has deteriorated. OSERS is responsible for managing and supporting IDEA, which guarantees a free public education for students with disabilities and is in its 50th year. The umbrella unit OSERS includes the Office of the Assistant Secretary, Office of Special Education Programs and the Rehabilitation Services Administration.“You take away the knowledge of the folks at the U.S. Department of Education at the Office of Special Education Programs — the law is complex, the combination of the federal law with state laws is complex — you need that trusted source of accurate information, and so, I think it’s going to make the implementation of this law that much more difficult,” Neas told States Newsroom. During the 2022-2023 school year, 7.5 million students in the United States received services through IDEA, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal agency. Neas encouraged parents to “know your rights” and “understand what the law does and does not do for your child, and don’t take no for an answer.” She said parents “really have to be well-versed in what the law requires schools to provide to their child,” and “have to be the ones that insist that the law is implemented with fidelity, because they’re the ones that are going to be on the front lines trying to make that happen.” ‘Flabbergasted’Jacqueline Rodriguez, CEO at the National Center for Learning Disabilities, said the RIFs would make it “impossible” for the Office of Special Education Programs to “carry out its statutory requirements.” Rodriguez, whose organization advocates for people with learning and attention issues, said “we had hundreds of staff doing this type of work — the statutory requirements are monitoring, compliance, guidance, support — it’s not just pressing a button and issuing funding.” She also noted that advocacy groups, including hers, are “flabbergasted” regarding the sweeping layoffs of special education staff because of the contrast with previous assurances Education Secretary Linda McMahon has made to both Rodriguez and Congress about supporting students with disabilities. “I am not stunned that the administration would try to dismantle something that was legally required in place,” she said. “But I am flabbergasted that the secretary would sit and give congressional testimony at her confirmation hearing. She did it at the oversight hearing. She sat in front of me and said, ‘No, Jackie, this administration supports kids with special needs. We will always be good advocates. You don’t have to worry.”Just days after the layoff notices were sent out, McMahon took to social media to downplay the consequences of the shutdown on her department.   Two weeks into the shutdown, “millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,” McMahon wrote. The secretary added that “it confirms what the President has said: the federal Department of Education is unnecessary, and we should return education to the states.” McMahon also specified that “no education funding is impacted by the RIF, including funding for special education.” Rodriguez said McMahon’s post indicates the secretary believes the “status quo is perfectly reasonable — when we know that’s not the case — and she dismantles every opportunity for a kid with a disability to actually have his or her legally-entitled education.”“I am beyond being polite and providing professional deference because there has been no consideration or deference to kids with disabilities for the last 10 months,” she added.The groups that advocate for students with disabilities are united in their opposition, Rodriguez continued.“Disability organizations across the country are united, we are all talking to one another,” she said. “We all work collaboratively, and we are in concert, lock and step.”Congressional Dems fiercely oppose cuts Meanwhile, a slew of Democratic lawmakers expressed outrage and concern over the department RIFs in two separate letters to the administration this month. Reps. Lucy McBath of Georgia, Mark DeSaulnier and Lateefah Simon of California, led dozens of fellow House Democrats in an Oct. 17 letter voicing to McMahon and White House budget director Russ Vought their “deep opposition” to the layoffs and urging them to “immediately reverse course and rescind the termination notices that were sent to these workers.”In another letter to McMahon, 31 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus wrote Monday that “punitive, reckless actions like these latest firings demonstrate how President Trump and ...Vought are relishing the government shutdown they caused — and are treating students as political pawns,” adding: “That is outrageous — and flatly unacceptable.”Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, led the letter, along with: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York; Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; and Sen.

Michael Bennet of Colorado speaks at a press conference in Brighton on Aug. 2, 2023. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Reopening the federal government with extended health care tax credits is the first step to allowing Americans continued access to public benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said in a press call Wednesday. 
“I think in the short term, what we have to do is get this health care decision done, protect the health care as it is for the American people, and then get to a point where we no longer shut down and we’re able to continue, uninterrupted, the SNAP benefits that people are relying upon,” Colorado’s Bennet said.
Members of the Senate failed to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, before the end of the fiscal year, meaning many major federal government operations shut down starting Oct. 1.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture directed states amid the shutdown to withhold November payments for people enrolled in SNAP, which helps low-income households buy food. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, asked the Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee to approve new funding to support food banks and pantries that may see an increased demand with the pause on SNAP benefits. 
Over 600,000 people in Colorado receive benefits from SNAP each month. 
The department needs to “use every ounce of their emergency authority to extend those SNAP payments as long as possible,” Bennet, a Democrat who is running to be Colorado governor in 2026, said. Congress needs to reach an agreement to reopen the government that leaves minimal impact on people’s access to food and health care, he added. 
Food prices have continued to increase and create a challenging environment for workers trying to feed their families, Bennet said, and the pending loss of SNAP benefits exacerbates that. 
At 22 days as of Wednesday, the shutdown is now the second longest in U.S. history, Bennet said. 










It is ridiculous that we are spending twice as much on health care as any industrialized country in the world, and yet families all over the Western Slope of Colorado, for instance, or in northern Colorado, cannot find access to primary care, cannot find access to mental health care, cannot find access to prescriptions that they are prescribed.


– U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado


Open enrollment for Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace begins on Nov. 1, and Bennet said his office hears daily from Coloradans worried about how they will pay for health insurance with premiums increasing. Democrats in Congress have said they won’t support a spending bill that does not extend enhanced premium tax credits, a bipartisan solution that Bennet said 80% of Americans support.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. According to KFF, insurance providers have cited the expiration of the tax credits as a reason for premium increases. 
In September, Polis said the average premium increases for Coloradans who get their insurance on the marketplace will be 170%, and people who live on the Western Slope will be hit hardest. The increases are expected to be 262% in Garfield County and more than 330% in Delta and Montrose counties.
“Republicans in Congress have a chance to make life just a little bit easier by working with Democrats to extend these health care tax credits and help small business owners and working families make ends meet,” Bennet said. “I think that we’re at a point now when the facts are not going to change in any meaningful way between now and when we’re across the threshold of the health insurance deadlines, and it’s not going to change between now and the end of the year.”
The American health care system is “broken,” and the U.S. should implement a universal health care system, because access to health care is a right, Bennet said. Passing the Affordable Care Act, which created the individual health plan marketplace, was “an important step forward, but it is not close to what we need to do as a nation,” Bennet said. 
“It is ridiculous that we are spending twice as much on health care as any industrialized country in the world, and yet families all over the Western Slope of Colorado, for instance, or in northern Colorado, cannot find access to primary care, cannot find access to mental health care, cannot find access to prescriptions that they are prescribed,” Bennet said. 
Colorado Republicans in the House, including U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction and U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton, blame Democrats for the shutdown and said they are blocking a simple short-term measure to allow the government to open before Congress can get back to debates over health care and other policies.

A permanent state budget cut will force the University of Idaho to cut 28 “essential” positions.
The reductions — in staff and faculty jobs — will lead to larger class sizes, less individualized learning time and fewer research opportunities for undergrads.
“This directly harms our students by negatively impacting student learning outcomes, retention rates and graduation timelines,” the U of I said in a revised budget request, released by the state late last week. “Our students will face increased financial pressures and be less prepared to join Idaho’s workforce.”
Facing $13.3 million in permanent budget cuts, several of Idaho’s state-run colleges and universities are planning — or considering — staff reductions.
The downsizing began to unfold on Aug. 15, when Gov. Brad Little announced a 3% holdback, a midyear budget cut, affecting most of state government. Little spared K-12 from the cuts, but not higher ed.
On Sept. 18, Little made the 3% cuts permanent — requiring state agencies, including the colleges and universities, to turn in new budget requests for 2026-27.
Those new requests were due Oct. 3. Little’s Division of Financial Management made them public Friday.
The U of I will be forced to cut $3.4 million permanently, including $3.1 million in personnel costs. While the U of I hasn’t settled on an exact mix of the job cuts, it says the loss of faculty positions will “slow down or stop” some ongoing research, while staff cuts will leave the U of I at increased risk to cybersecurity threats.
The ongoing cuts, at the U of I and elsewhere, are effective July 1.
Here’s how much the state’s other colleges and universities will need to cut — and how they plan to go about it.
Boise State University ($4 million). Between the budget cuts, rising benefit costs and state-mandated pay raises, a tuition increase “will be necessary,” Boise State says. The university will reassign workload and cut “some” positions, but the university didn’t go into specifics. Boise State will cut about $2.3 million in personnel costs; the rest of the savings will come from operations.
Idaho State University ($3.1 million). “To absorb the cut, ISU will reorganize and consolidate, eliminate programs and services, and reduce our employee workforce,” the university said in its new budget request. Like Boise State, Idaho State offered no specifics on staff cuts. But most of Idaho State’s budget cuts, $2.6 million, will come from personnel costs.
Lewis-Clark State College ($722,000). LC State will absorb the entire cut on the personnel side of the ledger — reducing funding for adjunct faculty, cutting two full-time positions and shifting around unspent money for pay raises.
College of Western Idaho ($681,000). Administrators and trustees are working on a budget-cutting plan for Idaho’s largest two-year school. CWI says its plan “may include supplanting lost state funds with tuition and fee adjustments or other revenue opportunities, targeted reductions, program assessments, pausing hiring for unfilled positions or other budget actions.”
College of Southern Idaho ($636,000). CSI will cut four positions — staff positions in payroll, enrollment and human resources and one faculty job. CSI will also scale back an IT infrastructure project.
North Idaho College ($486,000). NIC will keep three “student-facing support positions” vacant, while also cutting back on tuition waivers and a collaborative education center.
College of Eastern Idaho ($250,000). CEI will get all of its cuts from personnel — including a restructuring of its finance division, the “non-hire” of three instructors and a temporary hiring freeze.

(Edwin J. Torres Governor's Office)New Jersey alleges in a new lawsuit against Amazon that the ecommerce giant retaliated against pregnant and disabled warehouse workers who sought accommodations provided for by state law, the second action the state attorney general has taken against the retailer this week.
In the latest lawsuit, the state charges Amazon routinely placed warehouse workers who sought accommodations on unpaid leave, sometimes keeping them there even after the firm denied their requests. In other cases, state attorneys allege, Amazon outright fired workers only days after they sought accommodations.
“Put simply, Amazon has exploited pregnant workers and workers with disabilities in its New Jersey warehouses,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement. “In building a trillion-dollar business, Amazon has flagrantly violated their rights and ignored their well-being – all while it continues to profit off their labor.”
Disaster could wipe out NJ budget reserves, researchers warn

The suit claims Amazon violated New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination by terminating employees who sought accommodations, unreasonably denying requests for accommodations, or creating accommodations that make it impossible for a worker to meet the firm’s productivity requirements.
The firm placed employees on unpaid leave after denying their accommodation requests as a matter of policy, the suit claims.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel called the state’s claims “simply not true.”
“Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees is our top priority, and we’re committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone. The fact is we offer employees comprehensive accommodations throughout their pregnancy journey and postpartum. Since 2022, we’ve processed more than 72,500 pregnancy accommodations requests in US Operations alone, and our current approval rate for pregnancy accommodation requests is higher than 99%. We also offer up to 20 weeks of fully paid leave for eligible birthing parents,” Nantel said.
Amazon is New Jersey’s largest private employer. The company has roughly 50,000 workers in New Jersey warehouses, state attorneys said.
Provisions added to the state’s anti-discrimination law in 2014 require employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers and those with disabilities. Protections are stricter for pregnant workers, requiring employers to provide them with periodic rest, assistance with physical tasks, and modified work schedules, among other things.
In one instance, Amazon denied a pregnant worker’s request to be removed from a packing job that required her to lift items weighing up to 50 pounds, according to the lawsuit, which says the employee miscarried on the job.
In another case, a pregnant worker received extra breaks and was barred from lifting items heavier than 15 pounds, only to be terminated a month later, according to the lawsuit, which says the weight restrictions decreased the number of items she could move each shift.
“Amazon has engaged in practices that had dire financial and health consequences for pregnant and disabled workers in New Jersey,” Yolanda Melville, director of the state’s civil rights division, said in a statement. “Today’s complaint underscores our commitment to protecting people working in our state.”
On Monday, the Attorney General’s Office and the state Department of Labor filed a separate lawsuit alleging Amazon had misclassified some of its delivery drivers as independent contractors.
The state alleges the firm denied those workers benefits and overtime pay due to their classification despite exerting significant control over the place and manner of their work.

With November SNAP benefits unlikely to arrive Nov. 1, food banks are warning they don’t have anywhere near the capacity to feed roughly 250,000 New Mexico households that rely on the food help. (Daniel Montaño/KUNM)In a little over a week, more than 450,000 New Mexicans will likely lose their food benefits amid the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
In the state with the nation’s highest rate of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program reliance, the abrupt cancellation of SNAP nationwide will mean 250,000 households could go hungry and grocery stores would lose significant revenue, local food bank representatives told a legislative committee Wednesday in Las Cruces. 
“People are scared. They don’t know how they’re going to feed their families. And frankly, if the shutdown does go on any longer, we are looking at a public health crisis,” Jason Riggs, advocacy director of the Roadrunner Food Bank, said Wednesday. 
On Oct. 10, SNAP administrators at the federal Agriculture Department warned states, including New Mexico, that shortfalls left SNAP without adequate funding in November. As a result of the shortfall, the department ordered states not to submit client files to statewide SNAP vendors that they’d need to approve SNAP purchases in November.
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

HCA Secretary Kari Armijo said on Oct. 15 that the state’s interpretation of the USDA order was that it effectively revoked SNAP retailers’ authorization to approve purchases, “so folks with SNAP benefits on their cards would not be able to access those benefits starting in November,” she said.
Still, she reported that the state was seeking additional clarity from USDA. 
Marina Pina, a spokesperson for the state Health Care Authority, which oversees SNAP, did not immediately respond Wednesday to Source New Mexico’s request for an update on the SNAP cuts.
Riggs said Wednesday much remains unknown about how the nation’s food system will operate as of Nov. 1. For example, whether electronic benefit cards will still work in 10 days, or whether stores will still accept them, is an open question. 
“I was in a national meeting of hunger advocates yesterday and a lot of states are reporting just chaos and confusion,” he said. 
About 1,700 retailers statewide accept SNAP payments for groceries, according to state figures. More than half of them face high risk of significant revenue reductions, including closure, according to a recent Source analysis of Center for American Progress data. 
NM SNAP benefits for November threatened due to shutdown, HCA secretary says

Amid the uncertainty, Riggs and other food bank leaders warned that one thing is clear: They do not have anywhere near the capacity, especially without much notice, to make up the losses people will experience without SNAP. 
SNAP currently provides nine times as much food assistance as food banks, Riggs said. 
“Food banks cannot make up for that kind of gap, especially not by November,” he said. 
Jill Dixon, director of the New Mexico Association of Food Banks and the executive director of The Food Depot, added that the state’s five food banks are rapidly preparing to do what they can. That means starting pop-up food distributions; buying more food and food storage; and activating volunteers. 
Their response is “much like we did in the pandemic,” she said, “when you saw food banks step forward and rise and provide for people during closures and shutdowns.”
The Health Care Authority is also trying to expedite the delivery of roughly $8 million in funding for food banks lawmakers approved in the special legislative session earlier this month, but that’s still far less than $90 million in SNAP benefits the state expected to administer in November.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/download-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-22 17:00:41.668471

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — What, exactly, the crafters of the South Carolina constitution meant in writing “per diem” more than a century ago could determine whether legislators get the pay raise they voted for themselves this year — or even their normal monthly allowance.
At stake in a lawsuit heard Wednesday by the state Supreme Court is $30,000 per legislator: the $1,000 monthly for so-called “in-district compensation” that legislators have received since 1995 and the $1,500 legislators added to that monthly payment as part of the state budget.
The 44 legislators (all Republicans) who opted out of the raise included Sen. Wes Climer of Rock Hill.
After he sued to challenge the pay hike, the state’s highest court paused all payments until justices decide whether the $1,500 boost was legal. Ultimately, that meant legislators took a $1,000 monthly pay cut starting with the July 1 fiscal year, which they’ll collect in backpay only if justices rule in their favor. Otherwise, they’ll need to pass a new law just to restore their regular allowance.

The pay boost was inserted in the state’s spending plan during a late-night budget debate in the Senate, with sponsors arguing that inflation has caused expenses to increase significantly in the past three decades.
State law sets legislators’ salaries at $10,400 annually for the five months of the official legislative session. But their legislative duties require significantly more time and work throughout the year, attorneys representing the House and Senate argued.
Justices recognized that, said Chief Justice John Kittredge.
“On the policy point, you’ll get no pushback,” Kittredge told the Senate’s attorney. “It’s just a matter of whether this was done through an appropriate and constitutionally proper vehicle. That’s where the concern is.”
That concern came down to whether the payments qualify as the sort of compensation constitutional delegates in the 1800s prohibited legislators from raising outside of election years.
Phrasing changed between the state’s last two constitutions, noted Justice George James.
The 1868 constitution (which brought South Carolina back into the Union) used the word “compensation.” But the 1895 constitution, which the state still operates under, switched to the term per diem — literally “per day.”
James asked attorneys: Why make that change if not to reflect a literal daily rate?
Kenneth Moffitt, representing the state Senate, agreed.
The $10,400 annual salary, which is technically the sum of a daily rate for the regular session — three days a week, five months of the year — is the only form of payment legislators are prohibited from raising for themselves, Moffitt argued.
“The per diem, the salary, will be the same next session as it was this past session,” Moffitt said. “It hasn’t changed.”
Phillip Barber, representing Climer and Rock Hill resident Carol Herring, contended the wording change doesn’t affect the intent of the prohibition.
Delegates in 1895 used the term “per diem” simply because that was how legislators received their pay. Splitting up payments weekly or monthly shouldn’t give legislators 130 years later free reign to award themselves whatever they want, Barber argued.
Kittredge questioned a more recent phrasing change.
Until 1988, legislators called their additional pay for work outside the Statehouse a “legislative expense allowance,” suggesting it was a reimbursement instead of a salary. The state constitution makes no prohibition on raising reimbursement rates, attorneys have agreed.
Senator sues over his own raise, arguing it violates SC constitution

For reasons unclear to justices and attorneys alike, legislators changed the phrasing nearly 40 years ago to “in-district compensation.”
Moffitt and fellow attorney Andrew Mathias, representing the House, argued the monthly payment is still a reimbursement for expenses. But Kittredge said that’s not clear from the budget directive legislators passed.
“Somehow, we’re supposed to engraft and impute and infer that this is limited to expenses, and there’s not a hint of it in the language,” Kittredge said. “That’s the concern I have.”
The use of the word “compensation” is a clear indication that the money is part of a legislator’s salary, making it impermissible to increase, said former state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, the other lawyer representing Climer and Herring.
“When they say compensation, they mean compensation,” Harpootlian said.
Legislators can spend the monthly payment however they want. And they don’t have to submit any paperwork to get it.
Justices questioned whether that freedom makes the payment part of legislators’ salary, not a reimbursement.
“Because it doesn’t have to be used for expenses, you can use it for your mortgage payment, you can use it for your car payment, you can use it for anything you want,” Justice John Few said. “So, it is a workaround to increase compensation.”
Legislators intended for the money to go toward covering expenses such as gas used to drive across large districts, Moffitt said. But Few questioned how he could know that, considering the clause itself is only one sentence long and includes no explanation.
Aiming for a raise, SC legislators instead get a $1,000 a month pay cut

If the court throws out the clause in the state budget, legislators’ pay raise and normal allowance both vanish for this fiscal year.
If that’s the ruling, Kittredge said, legislators could pass a new law when they return in January to reinstate their $1,000 monthly payment, then pass a raise in the next budget that wouldn’t take effect until January 2027 — pushing it past the 2026 elections.
Nothing in the state constitution bars legislators from raising pay for the next General Assembly, attorneys for the petitioners said.
“So, you’re essentially saying if the Legislature had done this in an even-numbered year” and delayed the effective date, it would be legal, James asked Barber.
“Yes, your honor,” Barber replied.
Beyond the question of compensation, justices questioned whether Climer, as a sitting senator, could sue over a law he didn’t like. Climer, in challenging the Senate, was essentially suing himself, Justice Letitia Verdin said.
“Are we opening the door to allow a legislator who’s on the losing end of a vote to now start bringing lawsuits in front of this court against their own body?” Verdin asked.
Kittredge said all justices shared that concern.
In response, Barber said Climer sued in his capacity as a private citizen.
Herring, a retired teacher from Rock Hill, had every right to sue, Barber added, a point to which justices agreed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4317-scaled-e1761165772321-1024x670.jpeg,,,2025-10-22 17:00:41.668471

Shown here is a technician certification program at Eastern Iowa Community College. (Photo courtesy of Eastern Iowa Community College)Iowa community colleges could see reduced funds for high-demand job training programs if some recommendations from the Iowa DOGE task force report are implemented by the state Legislature.
The report, released Monday, included 45 recommendations from business leaders who met throughout the year to identify areas where state and local government could save costs and become more efficient. One of the three work groups convened through the task force focused on workforce issues in the state, such as how to address shortages in fields like health care and improve development opportunities.
The DOGE task force made multiple suggestions to change Iowa’s current workforce development programs, saying in the report the state’s current workforce programs are “fragmented, outdated and not employer driven.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The report recommended sunsetting the Iowa Industrial New Jobs Training (260E) program, currently administered through Iowa’s community colleges, and establish a new, $30 million “employer-directed workforce training fund within Iowa Workforce Development.” This program, alongside others like the Iowa Jobs Training and Accelerated Career Education programs, were created decades ago and rely on 10-year bonds to finance training grants, delivered through community colleges — but DOGE task force members argued this structure does not reflect how training is typically delivered, and is not the most efficient way to fund training.
“Nearly three-quarters of 260E-funded training is now delivered by the businesses themselves or third-party providers and yet, according to IWD, community colleges still receive about 20% in administrative fees from bond proceeds, and about 10% of those funds go to debt service costs,” the report argues. “Bonding as a funding mechanism is antiquated, costly and inefficient. No other state uses a model like Iowa’s 260E program anymore. Furthermore, Iowa’s recent tax cuts have reduced the stream of diverted tax revenue used to repay these bonds, jeopardizing the 10-year repayment schedule. The working group recommends eliminating bonding as a funding method and estimates roughly $40 million per year will return to the state General Fund as existing 260E bonds are paid off.”
While the DOGE task force report criticized the practice of using bonds for this program, Emily Shields, executive director of Community Colleges for Iowa, said this funding model allows the state to better respond to workforce needs. The Iowa Industrial New Jobs Training program is funded through withholdings of newly created jobs, she said, with employers pledging to create a certain number of jobs in the state and community colleges taking out a bond “so that employers can receive the training dollars up front, and then it gets paid off over time with the withholding from those new jobs.”
“It’s really a brilliant funding mechanism that doesn’t have an initial cost to taxpayers, because it’s new income that the state just hasn’t seen yet, and the bonding allows for that the funding to go to the employers up front, so that they don’t have to wait until the withholding tax starts to show up for those new employees,” Shields said. “And they can do the training when they need to do the training.”
Shields also said though funding for the existing program changes each year based on demand, the proposed $30 million fund “certainly would represent less funding to businesses.”
Additionally, she called arguments about the program’s high administrative costs a “mischaracterization” of the services offered, saying these costs include community colleges’ support implementing workforce training efforts for rural and small businesses that do not necessarily have the training staff, a Human Resources department or other needed resources to implement the workforce development programs on their own.
The task force’s recommendation would make it more difficult for these businesses to receive workforce development funds, she said.
“I would fear that a program that is granted out of Des Moines and requires businesses to apply and administer the funds themselves, is going to significantly disadvantage smaller and more rural businesses,” Shields said.
The task force said in the report Iowa employers gave feedback saying they “need and want to have the flexibility to work directly with a variety of training providers – including private vendors and equipment manufacturers.” The report also recommended creating a new $15 million workforce infrastructure fund at IWD.
Additionally, the DOGE task force recommended combining certain tuition assistance programs into a a single $20 million scholarship fund for high-demand careers. While the report did not include a list of which programs would be consolidated, it stated the workforce group “identified $32 million in tuition assistance programs that could be consolidated into a new, streamlined program that would ensure state tuition dollars are focused on the fields most beneficial to Iowa’s employers.”
The proposed change would mean a reduction of $12 million in scholarship and tuition assistance for Iowa students, but the task force report stated this funding could be “redirected toward employer-driven workforce training.”
Shields said state community college leaders support making it “easier for students to navigate the funding available to them,” but was looking for more information on what specific programs would be consolidated through the change.
“Depending on what that includes, that could mean a significant cut in scholarship funding, and that certainly would be of great concern, especially right now with the workforce shortages that we have and the great economic need we have for folks to go back to college,” Shields said.
At a Tuesday news conference on the report, Gov. Kim Reynolds said she believes there were areas where Iowa’s workforce development systems could become more efficient, and could better address shortages in specific fields.
“When you’re spending $400 million annually into workforce programs and we still have an issue — something’s not right,” Reynolds said. “So we got to be better. We got to get better, and … there should be an expectation, that, ‘I’m going to put this money to this program, this is the metric, the outcome that we expect.’ And if that doesn’t happen, then it needs to go away.”

More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, as of Sept. 1, according to a DHS press release.
“DHS is awaiting additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the federal agency that administers SNAP benefits, and will provide updates as they are available,” the press release said. “At this time it appears that the shutdown may prevent November benefits from being issued on time.”
DHS urged enrollees to identify nearby “food pantries, churches and community organizations that can provide temporary food assistance.” It also advised SNAP enrollees to stock up on shelf-stable foods that can last through “November and beyond.”
As shutdown drags on, Arkansas food banks prepare for expected SNAP interruptions

“The SNAP retail system may disallow purchases beginning on Nov. 1 even if you have funds in your account,” the release warned.
Arkansas is the most food insecure state in the nation, according to a 2024 USDA report. Food banks previously told the Advocate that interruptions to SNAP benefits would come at a time when they are already “maxed out.”
“SNAP is a critical program that helps ensure families all across our state have access to nutritious foods, and even a brief disruption is problematic,” said DHS Secretary Janet Mann.
Mann implored Arkansans to “do everything we can to support one another so that no family goes hungry,” and to donate to or volunteer at local food banks if able.
SNAP benefits are currently paid entirely by the federal government — though that is set to change in coming years.

DHS said that while the shutdown may result in delays in SNAP application processing or renewals, recipients should continue completing required paperwork.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is asking the state for up to $10 million to support food banks as upcoming food nutrition funds are held up in the federal government shutdown.
Money for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program typically goes out on the first of the month, but it is almost certain that the government shutdown will prevent the November benefits from going out on time. That means the 600,000 Coloradans who rely on the program will not receive money to purchase food from grocery stores. About $120 million in SNAP benefits are distributed to low-income households each month in Colorado.
“We have a role to play to fill the gap created by the closure of the federal government,” Polis told reporters during a Wednesday press conference. “Obviously, the $10 million is certainly not enough to fill the gap, but it is amplified (by food banks’ purchasing arrangements). It might be more like $30 or $40 million of retail buying power.”

Polis wants the Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee to approve money for Feeding Colorado, which represents the five Feeding America organizations in the state, to buy food for food banks and pantries that are likely to face increased demand. The request would be for about $3.3 million every two weeks, meaning that up to $10 million could be spent by mid-December. He said he expects the funding to be approved before the end of the month.
Dawn Washington, who attended the press conference, typically receives about $260 per month in SNAP benefits. The 55 year-old Denverite shares those benefits with her adult son and other family members, and she worries about how to get food on the table in November, especially as groceries go up in price due to inflation, she said. She has visited food banks in the past and plans to do so again during the federal shutdown.
“I’m going to hit up the local food banks to see what they’re offering, and make do with whatever they give me,” she said. “My son just asked, ‘What are we doing for Thanksgiving?’ I said, ‘I don’t know — whatever the food banks are going to give us.’ We might have chicken strips for Thanksgiving dinner, but as long as we’re eating, that’s what we need to be thankful for.”










My son just asked, ‘What are we doing for Thanksgiving?’ I said, 'I don't know — whatever the food banks are going to give us.'


– Dawn Washington, Denver resident


Polis and other state leaders are also calling on Coloradans to donate to Feeding Colorado during the federal shutdown. Erin Pulling, the CEO of Food Bank of the Rockies, said that for every dollar the organization gets, it can distribute three meals worth of food. Every donation to Feeding Colorado will go towards food purchases, she said, and the organization will absorb any increased overhead and administrative costs.
“We have massive purchasing power and the ability to scale up,” she said. “We are bringing in 40 truckloads of food every week, and we are ready, willing and able, but we need the community’s support.”
Pulling called the anticipated lapse in SNAP funding a “crisis within a crisis,” as food banks brace for increased need resulting from upcoming changes to SNAP made through the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed this summer.
Farmers affected
The average Colorado household who is enrolled in SNAP gets $357 per month, and Polis emphasized the downstream effect that has for grocery stores and farmers who rely on those dollars being spent.
“If they don’t have those SNAP benefits there, there could very well be layoffs or reduced hours from some of the grocers that serve a high-percentage SNAP population,” he said.
Costilla County has the highest percentage of estimated SNAP recipients for next month, with about 41% of residents getting benefits, according to state data. Southern Colorado counties generally have a higher share of people on SNAP.
Denver County has about 14% of its residents on SNAP, Arapahoe County has 10.5% and El Paso County has about 12%.
In Colorado, public school students can get a free breakfast and lunch at school through the Healthy School Meals for All program. That is not affected by the shutdown.
The federal government has been shut down since the start of October, when Congress was unable to pass a short-term funding bill. Senate Democrats refused to vote for that legislation because it did not extend health care tax credits that keep certain insurance premiums from skyrocketing. The shutdown impacts are far-reaching and touch safety-net programs like SNAP, federal worker pay, job security at government agencies and operations at places like national parks.
“We shouldn’t be caught up in politics. Whatever is going on in the politics should not affect the little people,” Washington said. “(People in Congress) are still going to go home and eat whatever they’re eating. They’re not going to go to the food banks. They don’t care that the food banks are even being strained.”
People can donate money online at feedingcolorado.org/donate. They can also donate food directly to a local food bank. People who need help from a food bank can find locations at feedingcolorado.org/find-food.

The statement came a week after the Florida Democratic Party (FDP) called on Republican National Committee Chairman Joe Gruters and RPOF Chairman Evan[...],"YouTube screenshot of Jared MoskowitzThe Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) called upon two congressional Democrats Wednesday to condemn extremist rhetoric they said was exhibited at some “No Kings” rallies held across the country last Saturday.
The statement came a week after the Florida Democratic Party (FDP) called on Republican National Committee Chairman Joe Gruters and RPOF Chairman Evan Power to denounce hateful speech revealed among Young Republican groups that was leaked in a Politico story.
Arguments about which political party espouses more hateful rhetoric has become commonplace since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated last month in Utah.
Power issued a statement Wednesday calling on South Florida U.S. Rep. Jared Moskowitz and Central Florida U.S. Rep. Darren Soto to condemn what he claimed was “the violent and extremist rhetoric” seen at some “No Kings” rallies. Both Democrats are being heavily targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) as they run for re-election next year.
Last week, the NRCC released a statement calling the two Democratic members of Congress “out of touch” as the federal government shutdown continues.
“Democrats can’t stay silent while their supporters glorify political violence,” said Power. “We saw ‘No Kings’ protestors mocking the death of Charlie Kirk. They think this is funny, it’s not. That kind of behavior is disgusting, dangerous, and unacceptable. It’s time for Soto and Moskowitz to make it clear: political violence should never be condoned or celebrated.”
“As someone who has a constituent serving 25 years for a potential assassination plot against me, of course I condemn this and all calls for political violence,” Moskowitz responded via X. “Just as we saw yesterday when a pardoned January 6 rioter was arrested for plotting to kill Leader Hakeem Jeffries.”
In the case of the potential assassination plot, Moskowitz referred to a Broward County man sentenced to 25 years in prison in August for amassing weapons, tactical gear, and attack plans targeting Jewish and Black Americans, according to the U.S. Justice Department.
Shortly after that man was arrested last year, Moskowitz said in a statement that the Margate Police Department had notified him that a former felon had been arrested not far from his home with written antisemitic rhetoric and his name listed on a “target” list.
Moskowitz also cited a death threat made against Jeffries days ago by a Jan. 6 rioter pardoned by President Trump earlier year. That man faces charges of plotting to assassinate Jeffries.
‘Dangerous undercurrent’
Last week, it was the Florida Democratic Party’s turn to call upon GOP leaders to respond to a series of bigoted remarks made by a dozen millennial and Gen Z Republicans between January and August, as reported by Politico. The story detailed how the chat group’s discussions via Telegram included racist slurs against Black people and a description of rape as “epic.”
“These remarks are not isolated; they reflect a dangerous undercurrent that undermines our democracy,” FDP Chair Nikki Fried said on Oct. 16.
“There is no excuse for this kind of vile, antisemitic, racist, misogynistic hate. The Republican National Committee must immediately condemn these comments and take action. Joe Gruters and Evan Power need to denounce this behavior publicly and make clear that racism and antisemitism have no place in their party.”
It’s not clear whether Power or Gruters ever responded. Vice President J.D. Vance said that “kids do stupid things, especially young boys,” adding that “they tell edgy, offensive jokes.  That’s what kids do.”
Neither the FDP nor the RPOF responded to requests for comment.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-22 20:00:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,Deal lets Rankin cities incorporate Jackson-owned land around Evers airport,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/22/deal-lets-rankin-cities-incorporate-jackson-owned-land-around-airport/,An agreement approved 5-2 by the Jackson City Council allows Flowood and Pearl to annex Jackson-owned but currently unincorporated land to the west and east of Jackson's airport.,"The city of Jackson will continue to own thousands of acres surrounding its airport under a settlement that is expected to clear the way for economic development on what’s long been considered some of Mississippi’s most coveted real estate. 
The agreement was approved by the Jackson City Council by a 5-2 vote Tuesday. It allows Flowood and Pearl, growing cities in Rankin County, to annex Jackson-owned but currently unincorporated land to the west and east of the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport. The deal seeks to conclude a seven-year-old lawsuit in which those suburban cities sued to incorporate some of the land.
The airport is a few miles east of downtown Jackson. It is in Rankin County and is the rare example of a Mississippi city owning land outside the county where the city itself is located.
Through the annexation, the municipalities must now provide essential services that can entice development to the acres of currently empty, grassy land along Airport Road and the East Metro Parkway, a major thoroughfare in Rankin County. Jackson also gets to incorporate a portion of the land around the airport into the capital city as part of the deal.
The council’s vote comes amid a separate, nearly decade-long battle over governing control of the city’s airport, which the deal passed Tuesday does not impact.
“It’s very ripe for having a high-end development for office space, retail space and other space like that,” said Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote, likening the area’s potential to that of Highland Colony Parkway in Ridgeland. “But it’s just been on hold because of the confrontation surrounding the airport.”

The arrangement concerns the minutiae of Mississippi land law and what it means for a city to own versus incorporate land, said Councilman Kevin Parkinson, who oversees Ward 7 where the airport is located. He filmed a 14-minute YouTube video explaining why he supported the agreement.
“All of our fates are tied up together, and we can’t continue to fight each other if there’s ways for things to be mutually beneficial,” Parkinson said. 
The Jackson airport has owned the land for decades and could have leased it for development, but since the land was not city-incorporated, Jackson was not providing essential services like water, police and fire protection, making development difficult. 
Under Tuesday’s agreement, the city of Jackson will continue to profit off any leases on land it owns because the airport will essentially act as a landlord for developers. 
“It’s not like Flowood is going to put a bunch of undesirable businesses there with no insight from the airport,” Parkinson said. “That’s what it means to own the land. You get benefits, including you can simply say, ‘Nope, I don’t want that business here.’” 
Meanwhile, Flowood and Pearl will provide services in their respective incorporated areas, and in turn collect the property tax and sales tax revenue generated there. 
This is what Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who voted against the measure, said causes the “bad taste that’s in a lot of citizens’ mouths,” as they’ve witnessed a boom of sales-tax-generating development along Lakeland Drive in the last couple of decades, mostly benefitting Flowood.

“The question that came up when they were doing it is: How how in the world this is supposed to be airport property, but the city of Jackson gets not a dime in sales tax? So they feel there’s some trickeration taking place,” Stokes said during Tuesday’s council meeting. “And they feel the same thing is going to happen with this. They feel this is a slow way to take the airport.”
The two suburban cities also agreed to support Jackson’s request to annex parts of the land around the airport. 
“Rather than a point of contention, it needs to be a point of one plus one equals three rather than one plus one equals zero,” Foote told Mississippi Today. 
Pearl Mayor Jake Windham could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Flowood Mayor Kathy Smith was out of the office for a ribbon cutting, her assistant said. 
A statement from Jackson Mayor John Horhn heralded the agreement as a win for the capital city, noting that the airport-owned land will benefit from the water and sewer system that Pearl will set up within the next year and a half. 
“This deal does not give away one inch of land,” Horhn’s statement said. “The City of Jackson remains proud owner and steward of the airport and its surrounding lands, and we are committed to ensuring that this partnership strengthens, rather than diminishes, our city’s economic future.” 
The vote also seeks to end to a legal dispute between Jackson, Flowood and Pearl that began in 2018 after the latter two cities filed a lawsuit to annex thousands of acres around the airport. 
Parkinson said he voted for the deal in part to avoid a trial in the lawsuit, which the cities filed in Rankin County. Not only did he believe a Rankin County judge would be more favorable to Flowood and Pearl, Parkinson said the judge would have only been able to rule on whether those two cities can annex the land they wanted — leaving no path forward for Jackson to annex the airport land that it wanted. 
As a bargaining chip at the settlement table, the two cities offered to go to Rankin County to help Jackson’s annexation request, Parkinson said. 
“To their credit, Pearl and Flowood came to partner, they came to negotiate,” he said.

,WyoFile,2025-10-22 20:00:00+00:00,WyoFile,Grand Teton speed runner Sunseri’s sentencing suddenly scrapped,"Billy Arnold, Jackson Hole News&amp;Guide",,,,,https://wyofile.com/grand-teton-speed-runner-sunseris-sentencing-suddenly-scrapped/,"

Federal magistrate judge skeptical of last-minute proposal in Grand Teton shortcutting case.
The post Grand Teton speed runner Sunseri’s sentencing suddenly scrapped appeared first on WyoFile .","U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Hambrick was not pleased Tuesday when she entered the courtroom.
Until late last week, Hambrick had been preparing to sentence Michelino Sunseri that morning, closing the first chapter of a legal fight that began a little over a year ago when the mountain runner attempted to set a speed record on the Grand Teton. But in a surprise twist, Sunseri’s attorneys reached a deal with the newly appointed U.S. attorney for Wyoming on Friday. The deal would impose a milder penalty for their client and wipe the misdemeanor charge from his record in exchange for community service and an educational class.
Judge Hambrick was unconvinced.
“It’s an interesting message you send to the public,” Hambrick told Sunseri’s attorney, Ed Bushnell, Tuesday morning in Jackson. “If you whine and cry hard enough, you get your way.”

Bushnell pushed back, arguing the message in the deal is about finding a punishment that fits the crime.
“It holds the defendant accountable in ways that are more stringent than higher-level crimes,” Bushnell said of the deal, comparing it to a DUI. “I hope it’s not ‘you whine and cry hard enough to get your way.’”
Ultimately, Hambrick declined to accept the proposed deal, instead seeking 30 days to review the proposal. She set a status conference to discuss the proposal at 2:45 p.m. Nov. 18.
The case stems from Labor Day 2024, when Sunseri bounded up and down the Grand Teton in 2 hours, 50 minutes and 50 seconds — about two minutes faster than the previous record holder. But because Sunseri took a shortcut known as the “Old Climbers Trail” on his descent, the arbiter of mountain running speed records rejected his record. Shortly after, the National Park Service charged Sunseri with cutting a switchback, a misdemeanor that comes with a fine of up to $5,000 or six months in jail.
In court, Sunseri’s defense team argued that the trail he took was not properly closed. Prosecutors said the opposite, and that the closure was commonly known. Hambrick found Sunseri guilty in September.
‘Really, really rare’
Technically, the deal proposed Friday and discussed Tuesday is called a “deferred prosecution agreement.”
While Sunseri’s case is being handled in federal court, similar agreements are used in state court to handle cases such as first-offense DUIs in which the defendant doesn’t injure anybody. If the accused follows the terms of the agreement for an agreed-upon time, the conviction can be expunged from their record.
In Sunseri’s case, attorneys for the prosecution and defense are now asking for 60 hours of community service, a required education class and a year of probation — a much lighter penalty than first proposed by the government. 
Afterward, Sunseri’s conviction would be expunged from his record, and his defense team would forgo its right to appeal the conviction.

That’s significant because attorneys with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm that fights government overreach, are representing Sunseri pro bono. They’ve already said they plan to appeal the decision.
Deferred prosecution agreements are rare in federal court, according to Grant Smith, a former federal public defender who now runs the University of Wyoming’s public defense clinic. Between 97% and 98% of all federal cases end in a plea bargain, and a deferred prosecution agreement is not, by definition, a plea.
“These are really, really rare,” Smith said.
In federal court, deferred prosecution agreements are typically used in corporate crimes. Rather than going to trial, a judge will require a firm to pay restitution, or amend board practices, later clearing a conviction.
But the timing of the proposal in Sunseri’s case is odd. Prosecutors and the runner’s defense attorneys had stalemated earlier over deferred prosecution proposals. Typically, similar agreements are used to avoid court costs and taxpayer expenses that come with a trial. Sunseri’s trial happened in May.
“From a taxpayer perspective, if all that’s going to be for naught, it could be viewed as a waste of resources,” Smith said. On the other hand, if a prosecutor realizes they have a weak case on appeal, they could buy into the sunk cost idea and accept an agreement like this late in the case.
Like the agreement, the timing is also “very atypical,” Smith said.
Hambrick agreed, calling the proposal an “abrupt change in course” by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Influencing Smith?
The remarkable, terse exchange between Hambrick and Bushnell was one of many in the 30-minute hearing Tuesday in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse. In contrast to Sunseri’s May trial, in which Hambrick was convivial and objective, the magistrate asked pointed questions and was sharply critical of the proposal before her, which had been approved by U.S. Attorney Darin Smith.
President Donald Trump appointed Smith, a former state lawmaker from Cheyenne, as U.S. Attorney in August. At the time, Sunseri’s legal team had made inroads with powerful people on Capitol Hill skeptical of the prosecution, painting it as an example of “overcriminalization.” Sunseri received pro bono legal assistance from the Pacific Legal Foundation and backing from U.S. Reps. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, and Andy Biggs, R-Arizona. Both are members of the House Judiciary Committee and sent a letter in July criticizing the prosecution and seeking answers.

Hambrick was clearly skeptical of Smith’s motives. In general, federal prosecutors are expected to act independently of political influence to preserve the independence of the judicial branch.
In the filing that Sunseri’s defense team submitted along with Smith and his deputy, lawyers cited federal law and case law to say that when a prosecutor seeks to dismiss an indictment, a judge can deny the motion only when it is “clearly contrary to manifest public interest,” like if the prosecutor sought dismissal to attend a social event rather than attend court — or if the prosecutor in question accepted a bribe.
“Unless the court finds that the prosecutor is clearly motivated by considerations other than his assessment of the public interest, it must grant the motion to dismiss,” the lawyers wrote, citing case law.
Hambrick keyed in on the language surrounding bribes.
“I don’t know if USA Smith has been bribed, or …” Hambrick said at one point, using the acronym for U.S. attorney, before trailing off.
Outside the courtroom, Sunseri declined to comment until after the trial concluded, punting to his attorneys a question about how the agreement with Smith was reached. Bushnell in turn referred the question to Alex Rienzie, his co-defense on the case along with the Pacific Legal Foundation. When asked explicitly whether the team had offered a bribe or exerted other influence over Smith, Rienzie emphatically said, “No.”
Rienzie said he had only ever emailed about the case with Ariel Calmes, the assistant U.S. attorney who has led the prosecution, and Nicole Romine, the head of the District of Wyoming’s criminal division.
A spokeswoman for Hageman said the congresswoman won’t comment on the case until it’s resolved. Hageman did not return a phone call seeking comment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not answer a direct question about influence and bribes in a statement provided late Tuesday evening.
The proposed deal “holds Mr. Sunseri accountable but allows him an opportunity to defer prosecution and sentencing in this matter on the condition that he complete certain terms,” spokesperson Lori Hogan wrote. “U.S. attorneys have discretion to make prosecutorial decisions based on what they feel is in the best interest of the public and the justice system, without consideration of outside influences.”
In court Tuesday, Calmes, the prosecutor under Smith’s supervision, appeared to distance herself from the deal. When Bushnell said that “she” had accepted the proposal, she stood up and objected.
“I do want to remind Mr. Bushnell that it’s USA Smith accepting the offer,” she said in response.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Five months before a new privacy law for judges took effect, a Louisiana Supreme Court justice cited it in a request to keep information about his divorce and the end of his 40-year marriage private. 
Justice Will Crain asked the state’s 22nd Judicial District Court, where he used to serve as a lower court judge, to seal his divorce records from public view in September 2024. The seal wasn’t lifted until almost a year later in August 2025, following inquiries from a reporter about why the records weren’t publicly available.
The new judicial privacy law, which took effect in February, allows judges living in Louisiana to keep a large swath of personal information, including marital records, out of government databases and off the internet. Judges said the law is needed to ensure their personal safety. 
But starting next year, the same privilege will be extended to hundreds of other local and state officials.

Louisiana lawmakers voted last spring to expand the reach of the law to cover themselves, statewide elected officials, public service commissioners, district attorneys, retired district attorneys, assistant district attorneys and district attorney investigators. 
Government transparency advocates worry the sweeping measure empowers judges – and soon many more public officials – to hide too much from the voters that put them into office. 
“This law is really, really bad. This is one of the worst in the country,” said David Cuillier, director of the Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. 

“Similar provisions have been weaponized in other states,” he said in an interview Monday. “It will be abused. I guarantee.” 
The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana wrote in a report that ”the law could easily be exploited to silence an elected official’s critics and hide unsavory information.” 
Some details in Crain’s divorce records that were kept from public view – such as the address of his family home – could potentially endanger the justice. But the divorce proceedings were also placed under seal at a crucial time in his career. 
President Donald Trump announced Monday that he had picked Crain to be a federal judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The lifetime appointment, which requires U.S. Senate confirmation, is typically made after several months of scrutinizing a nominee’s professional and personal life. Crain appeared Wednesday before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for questioning.
In the lead-up to his nomination, Crain has been dating his former Louisiana Supreme Court law clerk, Julie Eldridge, who stopped working for the justice shortly before he filed for divorce last year. 
In an interview this month, former Louisiana Supreme Court Justice James Genovese, now the president of Northwestern State University, said Crain and Eldridge are in a romantic relationship. 
Other attorneys, judges and people close to the state Supreme Court have also said Crain and Eldridge are dating but declined to comment publicly for this story because it could damage their professional and personal relationships. 
Crain and his divorce attorney have not responded to inquiries about his relationship with Eldridge sent through voicemail, text messages and emails since August. Eldridge, who is also divorced, did not respond to phone calls, text messages and an email sent to her over the past two months.

A divorce under seal
Eldridge became a member of the Louisiana Supreme court staff in 2009 and started working in Crain’s office in January 2020, the first year he joined the court.

Eldridge left her job as Crain’s clerk on Aug. 30, 2024, three weeks after she filed for divorce on Aug. 8, 2024, and two weeks before Crain filed for divorce on Sept. 13, 2024, according to their divorce records and her employment history. 
They didn’t provide reasons for separating from their spouses in their divorce petitions, and their former spouses’ filings do not include any allegations of infidelity.
In Louisiana, a person isn’t required to give the court an explanation for wanting a divorce. 

On the day Crain filed for divorce, Judge William “Billy” Burris of the 22nd District agreed to preemptively put any information about the justice’s divorce proceedings under seal. The move made it likely any filing made in the Crain case, including any filings from Cheri Crain, would not be publicly available.
The records were kept private initially because of concerns about Crain’s personal safety, said Ross Lagarde, the attorney representing the justice in his divorce, in an email in early August. Judges across the country have received threats of violence, and Lagarde said the secrecy allowed Crain to keep information out of the public that would make him vulnerable. 

“There was a … concern that in litigation you cannot control the pleadings filed by the opposing party,” Lagarde wrote in an email. “While it did not ultimately occur in this case, the opposing party could have contained Justice Crain’s and/or his family member’s home address or other information.” 
Public defenders sue Louisiana over their ‘terminations,’ allege governor’s office interference

The seal removed the listing for the Crain divorce in its entirety from the clerk of court’s public database for nearly a year, until two months after the divorce settlement was signed.

St. Tammany Parish Clerk of Court Jessica Jenkins Brewster’s office also initially refused to release details about the divorce filings in paper form when asked in July. After nearly two weeks of questioning, Brewster’s office turned over the docket number and the names of the attorneys representing Will Crain and Cheri Crain. 
Leanne Eckholdt, general counsel for the St. Tammany Parish Clerk of Court, said her office has had difficulties with its case management system and was forced to remove all listings for sealed cases from its database. 
Lagarde cited the 2024 judicial privacy law to argue that the Crains’ divorce proceedings should be shielded from public view. 

“If the record is not sealed, opposing counsel could file a pleading or other document containing protected information in violation of the Act and jeopardize the security of Crain or his family,” Lagarde wrote in a request to the court in September 2024. 
But the law Lagarde referenced was not in effect at the time of his request. Lawmakers approved that bill in the spring of 2024, but it wasn’t applicable until February 2025 – five months after Lagarde’s letter and the seal on Crain’s divorce records had been granted. 
In August, Lagarde offered to let the Illuminator review the divorce documents while under seal as long as “none of the protected information would be published.” 
The Illuminator never agreed to Lagarde’s offer. Less than a week later, Crain filed a motion to lift the seal and release the records.

Justices have favored disclosure for divorce records for public figures
In 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court decided that lower courts should not have allowed Popeyes founder Al Copeland Sr. and his fourth wife, Jennifer Devall Copeland, to seal their divorce record. 
“A party’s claim of mere ‘annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense’ is not enough to overcome the public’s right of access to public records,” wrote Justice Jeffrey Victory, who retired in 2014 and died last year, in the court’s opinion on the Copeland case. 
The Copelands requested the seal to protect the emotional well-being and safety of their children. The Times-Picayune sued to unseal the records, arguing there was public interest in their divorce.
The court sided with the newspaper. Justices reviewed the sealed records and determined general information provided about the child custody arrangement didn’t justify secrecy. 

Open court records guard against favoritism and misconduct in the judicial system, Chief Justice Bernette Johnson, who retired in 2020, wrote in a concurring opinion on the case. 

“The right of access to courts applies equally to all cases, including divorce cases, in order to ensure that proceedings are conducted fairly to all concerned, to satisfy the people’s right to know what happens in their courts, and to serve as a check on corrupt practices by exposing the judicial process to public scrutiny,” she argued. 
Divorce transparency might not apply to judges
Lagarde, Crain’s attorney, said the Copeland ruling doesn’t apply to Crain’s case after the Louisiana Legislature passed the wide-ranging privacy exception for judges in 2024. 

Act 628, sponsored by state Rep. Delisha Boyd, D-New Orleans, allows federal, state and local judges to demand personal information about themselves and their families be removed from websites and social media platforms, including those private parties operate. 
Boyd and the judge who advocated for the passage of the new law, Tiffany Chase with the Louisiana 4th Circuit Court of Appeal, declined comment for this article. 

Information judges can require to be taken off the internet includes their home address, date of birth, telephone number, Social Security number, place of worship, child’s school or daycare and the “employment location” of a spouse, child or dependent. 
Judges can also ask for “marital records” to be removed, but what that term might encompass beyond a marriage license is unclear. There was no definition of a “martial record” included in the new law, though Lagarde has said it applied to Crain’s entire divorce file. 

Cuillier, the public access expert from the University of Florida, said he isn’t convinced that marital records would necessarily cover divorce proceedings under the new law.

“A divorce isn’t a marriage. I think it is a stretch to call divorce records marital records,” he said after reviewing the law. 
Louisiana’s new judicial privacy statute permits judges to sue individuals and businesses who don’t agree upon request to remove their protected information from the internet. Violators could also be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges that come with a penalty of up to 90 days in prison or a fine of up to $1,000. 
Other states have passed similar laws in response to a national push from two judges who were attacked by people who appeared in their courtrooms.

Texas District Court Judge Julie Kocurek was shot and injured outside her home in Austin in 2015 by a man facing parole revocation in her court. U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas’ son was murdered and husband seriously injured in an attack on her doorstep in New Jersey in 2020 by a man who had appeared in her courtroom. 
Stephen Gillers, an expert in judicial ethics from New York University, said extra layers of privacy for judges can be justified. 
“It’s appealing to say that judges should be treated no differently from anyone else, and ordinarily that’s true, but they are different,” Gillers wrote in an email. “Their heightened visibility may warrant greater privacy depending on the facts.” 
Yet other states’ laws blocking the disclosure of judges’ personal information aren’t as sweeping as Louisiana’s. 
New Jersey, for example, shields public disclosure of addresses and phone numbers for judges, prosecutors and police. But it does not allow them to keep marital records confidential like the Louisiana law. 
Cuillier said Louisiana’s law is particularly alarming because it includes a much longer list of records to keep private when compared to other states. Media organizations and members of the public could also face more severe penalties for spreading information about public officials than they would in other states. 
“Marital record. Why keep that secret? …. Why is it bad to find out who I got married to and when I got married?” Cullier said. “This is a long list of things to have hidden.” 
Louisiana’s law will also apply to many more elected officials starting in February, when the sweeping expansion takes effect. 

At that point, local prosecutors, legislators, statewide elected officials and public service commissioners will have the same ability to demand their personal information – including marital records – be removed from social media and websites. They can also bring lawsuits and seek criminal penalties for those who publish that information. 
Supreme Court justice divorces can be complicated
Part of what came to light when the Crain records were unsealed last month is the challenge of handling a Supreme Court justice’s divorce. 
Four of the 12 judges on the 22nd Judicial District Court recused themselves from handling the Crain case – citing their “personal relationships” as a conflict of interest – before it was assigned to Burris, according to the Crain divorce records made public once the seal was lifted. 

The Crain and Burris families have known each other for several years. 

Burris replaced his father, William J. Burris, on the bench. The elder Burris, who presided from 1997 until 2017, served alongside Crain at the district court. 
Crain’s father, Hilary J. Crain, was also a judge for St. Tammany and Washington parishes for decades, though he never overlapped with either Burris. 
Judge “Billy” Burris declined to comment on his decision to grant the seal in the Crain divorce when asked by a reporter this month, though he noted the seal had already been lifted.

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe narrative of blame continues to shift over which chamber of the Legislature proposed and is ultimately responsible for the new controversial wholesale tax on Michigan marijuana products, with House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) now claiming credit during a Wednesday press conference.
The new 24% tax is estimated to raise $420 million in new revenue to fund road repairs and construction, and was a key negotiating chip when the Legislature was at an impasse over new funding for the current fiscal year.
It was a controversial measure that passed on a razor-thin margin in early October when legislators’ feet were being held to the fire to pass a full budget and avoid a prolonged government shutdown. 
The plan first emerged in the House, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Samantha Steckloff of Farmington Hills. But in the early hours of Oct. 2, days after the constitutional deadline to have a new budget passed, Hall made allusions to the tax being floated to him by Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), framing the push for new revenue via marijuana as a Brinks-endorsed plan.
Following the Senate’s vote on the bill, Brinks did not take credit for the measure, telling reporters instead that she put forward several different pathways to get new revenue. Brinks said that there was a willingness to consider each of those avenues – it was the marijuana tax, however, that appeared to be the only one that could get enough votes.

Hall’s or Brinks’ statements both raised additional questions, but in the moment, it was clear that both chambers were in a tough place and grasping at anything to avoid a prolonged shutdown.
The Senate clearly had a tough time corralling the votes needed to push it over the finish line, and with several senators appearing to hold their noses as they voted for the tax. Brinks’ comment may have been more aimed at the House, despite some defections in the Senate, because the bill passed in the House by a wide margin of 78 yeas to 21 nays.
With legal drama now steering the future of the tax, its implementation and new questions on what will happen to road funding if it falls apart, Hall has again signaled that Democrats in the Senate would be to blame for its shortcomings.
In a news conference held Wednesday, Hall said that it wasn’t House Republicans who wanted new revenue for roads – the chamber and caucus would have rather made bolder cuts in the 2025-26 fiscal year spending plan to shore up money for roads than approve a new and potentially unpopular tax.
Hall also said that he had seen Brinks make comments in recent interviews indicating that it was his fault for the tax, and not having a hearing before it was moved to the chamber’s floor for a vote.
“How many times have I come up here and said [during the budget cycle] that the Senate Democrats should pass a roads plan, because they want revenue, and that I didn’t want revenue? I wanted zero revenue,” Hall said. “I compromised with them, dollar for dollar. I said you cut $1 waste, fraud and abuse, I’ll give you $1 in revenue. The reason we didn’t get to $3 billion [for roads] is because the Democrats wouldn’t cut any more waste, fraud and abuse. If she had a preference on revenue, [Brinks] should have proposed a plan, and she should have had hearings on it. They didn’t do that.”
Hall said such a scenario could have avoided the Senate’s struggle to get the new tax over the hump hours before the government shut down briefly on Oct. 1. A hearing, though, might have made the measure more vulnerable because senators on the fence would have heard directly from cannabis industry advocates in a public setting where every comment was on the record.
But in an eye-popping turn, Hall said Wednesday that he was the one who decided to go the route of taxing marijuana because the Senate let him pick which tax was most palatable to House Republicans.
“If they would have performed and showed us what their plan was, there would have been all kinds of transparency, but they let me decide which one it was going to be,” Hall said. “And I said it’s going to be marijuana off your list. It’s going to be marijuana. I don’t think we need any of them, but we’ll do marijuana off your list because that’s the easiest one for us to get done.”

A message seeking comment from Brinks’ office was not returned at the time of publication.
That said, state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township) has been going on the offensive for the Senate Democrats on the pot tax deal that eventually pushed the budget toward the finish line.
In a hearing last week held by the Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee, of which Moss is the chair, the senator detailed a behind-the-scenes look at some of the conversations that brought the pot tax to the fore. 
Moss also gave details on some of his conversations with cannabis industry advocates who flooded the Capitol leading up to the vote.
One particular conversation stuck with him, Moss said.
“He said this is exactly what causes people to lose faith in government. That a major proposal impacting an industry was introduced on a Wednesday, voted on in the House on Thursday, and was taken up by the Senate the very next week,” Moss said. “Overnight, the speaker had come out clearly and said he would shut down the government if the 24% tax didn’t pass, and that was the only thing that he was going to accept.”
He said at that moment, and the man and other marijuana advocates “really understood that’s what we were dealing with.”

(Courtesy NPS)As Montana’s general rifle season for deer and elk kicks off this weekend, state wildlife managers have made some changes to deer licenses in the state in response to localized disease outbreaks.
Every year in Montana small pockets of game animals, usually white-tailed deer, succumb to diseases.
A family hemorrhagic diseases that includes epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) and blue tongue, saw late summer and early fall outbreaks across Montana, with the heaviest concentration in the northeastern part of the state, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
Earlier this month, FWP’s Fish and Wildlife Commission, the board that handles department policy, made a regulation change to limit white-tailed deer licenses in northeast Montana. The commission voted to limit the sale of region-wide 006-00 deer B licenses to a total of 2,000, and only allow one per hunter.
Hunters that purchased multiple licenses prior to Oct. 10, when the new regulation took effect, can still use the licenses.
EHD and blue tongue virus are spread through biting midges, and pockets of the disease often form along rivers or near other waterways where midges reproduce in large numbers. The viruses are often fatal, with animals dying from internal bleeding, and can result in high death rates in very localized areas.

“It’s real sporadic and real patchy,” FWP Game Management Division Chief Brian Wakeling told the commission at their October meeting. “We’re certainly seeing it places we’ve never seen it before, but we’re not seeing it at a level that’s a concern to a population from a biological standpoint.”
While the regulation change only affects hunters in Region 6 in the northeastern part of the state, EHD and blue tongue disease have been suspected in multiple localized die-offs around the state.
In mid-September, FWP officials put out a press release following reports of roughly two dozen dead deer near Eureka and a dozen near Plains, which they suspected were viral outbreaks. Localized EHD and blue tongue outbreaks were also reported along the Yellowstone River corridor in the southeastern part of the state and in prairie habitats.
In early October, the department suspected hemorrhagic diseases were behind white-tailed deaths around Frenchtown and along the Clark Fork River west of Missoula.
In Montana, outbreaks of EHD and BTV have historically occurred east of the continental divide, and while most deer and pronghorn mortality in Montana resulting from hemorrhagic disease infection still occurs in the eastern part of the state, EHD was documented west of the continental divide in Montana for the first time in 2013.
Outbreaks of the disease typically subside as winter weather descends on an area as hard frosts mitigate midge activity, and FWP expects mortalities to continue to slow with recent freezing temperatures across the state.
FWP staff say that members of the public do not need to report dead deer suspected of succumbing to hemorrhagic diseases in areas that are already being monitored.
Hemorrhagic diseases are not a risk to humans, and meat from animals that appear healthy at the time of harvest remains safe to eat when properly cooked. Hunters should avoid harvesting or consuming animals that appear sick.
Nationwide there has been an increase in EHD and blue tongue virus outbreaks. According to reporting in The Guardian this week, Ohio has received reports of more than 9,000 dead deer suspected of dying from hemorrhagic viruses, up from just 2,000 in 2024.
In northern Idaho, biologists with Idaho Fish and Game said they’ve received roughly 1,000 reports of white-tailed deer mortalities in the Clearwater region, suspected to be caused by EHD.

The Iowa Board of Regents announced Tuesday afternoon that four finalists had been chosen from eight semifinalists in the national search for the Ames university’s next president. Each of the finalists will come to ISU in the first week of November for meetings with campus stakeholders and to conduct open forums.
Semifinalists were interviewed by the presidential search committee virtually during meetings held Oct. 20-21, the culmination of part of the summer and fall seasons spent reviewing nearly 80 applicants for the role. The committee began its work in July in consultation with search firm AGB Search after ISU President Wendy Wintersteen announced earlier this year she will retire in January.

Search committee co-chair Regent JC Risewick said in an emailed statement the group “had an outstanding pool of candidates to consider,” any of which would “be a great president at ISU.” He added he’s “excited” for finalists to visit Ames and meet people.
“I also look forward to speaking with each candidate in person when they meet with the Board,” Risewick said in his statement. “It’s an exciting time, and I know with the quality of this group we are going to get an outstanding leader for Iowa State.”
Presidential search committee co-chair and ISU Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette said Tuesday each of the finalists’ names will be revealed the day before they’re scheduled to visit campus.
In addition to interviews with “selected members of the campus community,” Gillette said finalists will participate in forums that will be open to the public and livestreamed.
“There will be a feedback form developed so anyone will be able to provide their thoughts on each finalist after they make their trip to ISU and hold their public forum,” Gillette said. “On Nov. 11, the board of regents will meet with each finalist in closed session, and late that day make their selection for the next president of Iowa State University.”
Gillette was also impressed with the candidates they interviewed, she said in an emailed statement, and the fact that the committee “had such outstanding candidates to consider really shows that ISU is a destination of choice.”
“Narrowing it down to eight semifinalists was challenging, and even harder was deciding on four finalists,” Gillette said in her statement. “We are thrilled with those who have been invited to campus, and look forward to them connecting with the ISU community on their visits in early November.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Ahead of the 2026 legislative session, Gov. Ron DeSantis trumpeted Florida’s property and automobile insurance laws and warned members of the House of Representatives against trying to change them when the Legislature convenes in regular session in January.
During a news conference in Sarasota Wednesday, DeSantis said auto insurance premiums have decreased this year, on average, by 6.5%. 
“We are seeing rates go down in the auto space at a pace we have not seen in decades, and that is directly attributable to the litigation reforms,” Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworsky said. 
Progressive Casualty Insurance Co. announced in its Third Quarter SEC filing that in early 2026 it will return $950 million in excess profits to its estimated 2.7 million policyholders in Florida, citing statutory profit limits on auto insurers.
Lobbyists and onlookers have speculated that there will be another attempt to eliminate the state’s personal injury protection requirements (PIP) while Miami Republican Rep. Daniel Perez, an attorney, remains speaker of the House.
The Legislature in 2021 voted to repeal the state’s PIP requirements and return to a fault-based system, instead. DeSantis vetoed that bill (SB 54), acknowledging that although the “PIP system has flaws,” repeal could bring unintended consequences for the market and the consumer.
According to a USA Facts analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data, auto insurance in the U.S. as of 2024 had risen by 53.7% since 2020. 
“Florida has had kind of a difficult history of this over the years,” DeSantis said. “Part of it’s demographics, part of it’s driving ability and problems on the roads, but part of it was the legal environment, where Florida was considered a litigation hellhole by a lot of folks, and that contributed to consumers having to bear more cost with respect to auto insurance.”
The coming session, based on DeSantis’ warnings to the House, could prove as bumpy or bumpier than last session, when lawmakers extended the proceedings after disagreeing on major policy issues.
Not mentioning members of the House of Representatives, Yaworsky called Senate President Ben Albritton, former Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, and incoming Senate President Jim Boyd “steadfast defenders of the reforms that now Floridians are seeing the benefit of.”
“I’m hopeful that we can move the ball forward on things that will meaningfully add value to the consumers in the state and move past this trial bar issue that exists among bad-acting attorneys in this space,” Yaworsky said. “That billion dollars, much of it that is now going into the pockets of consumers, would have been going to those attorneys’ wallets, and that is the bottom line.”
It wasn’t only the automobile insurance market that DeSantis touted, with the governor pointing out that Florida Peninsula Insurance requested an 8.4% reduction in rates for homeowners premiums. 
DeSantis derided the House’s attempt earlier this year to reverse sweeping insurance changes made in 2022 and 2023. The Senate, however, had no interest in revisiting the changes that DeSantis said were being pushed on behalf of the state’s trial attorneys. DeSantis called the 2025 House legislation “very misguided.”
“I understand there’s lawyers who want that, I get that, but you didn’t get elected to represent lawyers, you got elected to represent your constituents,” DeSantis said. 
DeSantis derided the House further Wednesday, invoking the special session on immigration in which the House and Senate bucked the governor’s special session.

The Coast Guard announced this week it has abandoned the removal plan. (uscoastguard.maps.arcgis.com)The U.S. Coast Guard has cast off plans to remove hundreds of navigational buoys from the Northeast, including in Rhode Island.
The federal maritime agency announced Tuesday it was pausing its buoy modernization plan in light of the more than 3,200 public comments received.
“The Coast Guard will be conducting further analysis of the aids to navigation (ATON) system,” the agency said in a statement posted to its website. “There will be no changes to ATON in relation to the proposal until further analysis is complete.”
The update comes a month after the Coast Guard scaled back its initial plan due to concern from local mariners. Originally, the federal agency proposed removing 350 of the oldest buoys from regional waterways, including 37 in Rhode Island. The Coast Guard then amended its plans to take out 233 buoys, including 20 in Rhode Island.
The revised plan also reopened the public comment period through Nov. 15. But with the plan now suspended, the public comment period is closing early, the Coast Guard said. 
The Coast Guard billed the removal of navigational markers as an embrace of modern technology, targeting the oldest buoys that were put in place before modern GPS systems. But mariners, environmental groups and lawmakers, including U.S. Sen Jack Reed, argued the cuts could compromise safety for boaters who rely on the markers in bad weather, and when GPS systems are unavailable.
Reed praised the Coast Guard for taking heed of concerns on Wednesday. 
“This is a win for our marine interests, including recreational and commercial boats.  Rhode Islanders know these waters best and I appreciate the Coast Guard listening to their concerns,” Reed said in a statement. “This means all the buoys Rhode Islanders wanted to keep have been saved for the foreseeable future. 
The Coast Guard maintains roughly 400 buoys across Rhode Island.
The agency did not specify if or when it might revive a buoy removal plan. However, Rear Admiral Michael Platt, Northeast Coast Guard District Commander, said in a statement that modernizing water markers remained a priority.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)New congressional district boundaries in eastern North Carolina counties received final legislative approval Wednesday, a week after the public first saw the new map. 
State Republicans drew the plan at the behest of President Donald Trump. It seeks to make what is now the state’s only toss-up district unwinnable for a Democrat, bringing the state’s 14-member congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and four Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. The remaining Democratic districts are in the Triangle and in Charlotte. 
Trump has asked states under Republican control to change district boundaries to help elect more members of their party to Congress. Trump seeks to avoid a midterm slump that would erect roadblocks to his agenda. 
The House approved the maps 66-48 along party lines, following the Senate’s party-line approval Tuesday. Redistricting maps are not subject to veto by the governor, so they are now law. 
“We’ll be sending another strong conservative to Washington to represent this great state,” said Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus), the House Republican leader. 
Rep. Jimmy Dixon (R-Duplin) said Trump is the greatest president of his lifetime, and lawmakers are doing the right thing by helping him continue to implement his vision for the country. 
“I witnessed the divine intervention in preserving his life,” Dixon said. “He is a divinely changed man who loves this nation. I support the constitutional authority of this legislature to legally redraw our congressional districts.”
The gallery was cleared of protesters chanting about racist maps before the House vote. 
The redrawn map dismantles a bloc of Black rural voters who have helped elect a Black Democrat to Congress since 1992. U.S. Rep. Don Davis, a former state Senator, overcame a stiff Republican challenge to win his second term last year. 
Republicans have said much about their partisan motives, but claimed repeatedly this week that no racial data was used to draw the districts. 
Critics have responded that Republicans know they are weakening the chance that Black voters in the region will be able to elect the candidate of their choice. 
“You didn’t need to use racial data because every single member of this body knows about the Black population in the northeastern part of this state,” said Rep. Gloristine Brown (D-Pitt).
“North Carolina is the testing ground for the new era of Jim Crow laws,” she said. “You are silencing Black voices and going against the will of your constituents.”
The 1st Congressional District as it was configured for last year’s election is part of an unresolved federal lawsuit over claims that it dilutes the power of Black voters. Another lawsuit over the new district plan is anticipated.

“I’d be shocked if there was not legal action,” House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) told reporters after the vote. 
This week, Sen. Ralph Hise (R-Mitchell), who said he drew the new districts, was confident the plan would withstand a legal challenge. 
Vocal protests have marked the debate over district lines since Monday. 
At committee hearings, members of the public were each given one minute to speak. All were opposed. Chanting protesters were escorted from committee hearing rooms. 
An online portal received 12,280 comments about the new map since last week, said Rep. Beth Helfrich (D-Mecklenburg). She brought to the House floor a stack of printed comments to illustrate the public interest in the redistricting plan. Nearly all the comments were negative, she said. 
“At no point in these proceedings has their input been meaningfully considered,” she said. 
Davis is known as one of the most conservative Democrats in the U.S. House who has worked with congressional Republicans representing eastern North Carolina. He also worked with Republicans during his time in the legislature. 
Reives reminded Republicans that they are trying to end the congressional career of a Democrat they liked. 
“Don Davis busted his behind when he was here to work both sides,” Reives said. “He busted his behind to compromise. And he’s going home.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4126-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-22 16:02:38.466252

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, is praising the federal Department of Agriculture’s plan to reopen Farm Service Agency offices for what he described as “a few days a week” while the government shutdown continues.
Rounds said he discussed the issue Tuesday with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
“We’ve heard from producers who are selling their livestock and their grain who can’t get their checks endorsed while the government has been shut down, resulting in missed loan payments,” Rounds said in a news release. “Many producers use the FSA as a lender and they need to be able to release these funds as their loans are paid off.”
In response to questions from South Dakota Searchlight, a spokesperson for Rounds said the employees needed to reopen the offices are working without receiving a paycheck, but will receive backpay when the government reopens.
Rollins said earlier Tuesday on social media that the Farm Service Agency’s 2,100 offices nationwide will resume “core operations” on Thursday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-22 19:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials urge holding off on ACA enrollment amid federal shutdown,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/22/aca-tax-credits-ct-delay-enrollment-shutdown/,Federal tax subsidies that reduce the cost of purchasing health insurance on the exchanges are set to expire at the end of 2025.,"State officials are striking a different tone this year in their advice to Connecticut residents looking to enroll in health plans through Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance exchange.
“If you could, wait a little bit longer,” Access Health CT CEO James Michel told residents during a press conference on Tuesday. “Instead of enrolling on November 1, give it more time, because I know there’s conversations going on right now to try to get the subsidies resolved.”
Open enrollment for plans taking effect at the start of next year is slated to begin Nov. 1 and go through Dec. 15. Residents have until Jan. 15 to enroll in plans beginning in February.
The subsidies Michel referred to are known as “enhanced premium tax credits.” They were initially passed in 2021, as part of the American Rescue Plan, in an effort to bring down the cost of purchasing health insurance on the exchanges during the COVID era. 
Now they’re set to expire at the end of 2025. And they’ve become the crux of the current stalemate in Washington, where the federal shutdown has dragged on for more than 20 days, as Democrats demand Republicans extend the subsidies if they want the necessary votes to fund the government. On Tuesday, state officials encouraged residents to wait before enrolling in a plan to allow time for the situation in Washington to potentially resolve itself. 
This week, in advance of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1, residents who purchase health insurance through Access Health CT will receive letters informing them how much more they can expect to pay for coverage if the premiums do in fact expire.
Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday acknowledged that it’s an “incredibly scary” time for people receiving those notices.
“This is just really dumb policy coming out of Washington, coming out of this White House — the idea that you’re going to jack up the cost of health care,” Lamont said. “It’s incredibly erratic, and it’s just putting an extra load on middle class families who are just trying to get by.”
State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he and members of his caucus agree that the subsidies play a critical role in helping Americans afford the high cost of insurance. But he thinks federal Democrats should agree to fund the government while negotiations on how to extend them continues.
“Step one: Reopen the government so that people are provided the services they need, and we don’t continue to have a shutdown on this. And then step two, negotiate with Republicans, which they said they’re more than willing to do, from what I understand, and come to an agreement on continuing the subsidies. It’s pretty simple,” Harding said.
Around 90% of Connecticut residents who purchase a plan on the exchange receive financial support to help cover the cost. If the enhanced premium tax credits expire, there will still be some financial support available to people, but Connecticut residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for health insurance, according to Access Health CT. 
Over 135,000 people will lose at least some financial support. A fifth of those people, or roughly 27,000, will no longer be eligible for any financial assistance.
Lamont said state officials are hard at work coming up with a plan in case the subsidies aren’t extended, but he admitted that the hole created if they do expire would be too large for the state to backfill.
“I can’t make up all the shortfall of Washington falling down on their obligations,” Lamont said.
State officials would have to spend more than $295 million annually to pick up the costs of the enhanced premium tax credits if Congress fails to extend them, a spokesperson with Access Health CT said.
Last month, Lamont joined governors from 17 other states in calling on congressional leaders to extend the subsidies. 
Access Health CT CEO Michel reminded residents that the organization’s call centers remain open and available to answer questions, despite the government shutdown. He also stressed that, even though the enhanced premium tax credits could expire, some financial help will still be available to most people who currently receive it.
“So we encourage you to please still come back,” Michel said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ACA-NOTICES-1021-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-22 15:17:23.966496

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)On Tuesday, Democratic U.S. House candidate Matt Schultz sat down with Alaska Beacon reporter James Brooks to introduce himself and talk about why he’s running for office. Here’s a transcript, lightly edited, of that conversation.
James Brooks: I wanted to ask why, and why you? I know you’ve been unhappy with the way things have been for a while, but what pushed you over the edge and just made you decide to run?
Matt Schultz: Well, interestingly, those are two somewhat distinct questions. Why me? I believe that every person has a responsibility to use the many gifts and opportunities we have as a way to be of service to the world. And so my whole life, I’ve been doing my best to be of service, and that’s been part of my personal life and also my ministry and everything that I’ve been doing. So why me is because I think every person should be of service, and if the opportunity presents itself, we have a duty to serve as many people as possible. 
Now, as far as what pushed me over the edge for this particular decision, there’s been an increasing amount of concern, particularly amongst members of my family and working-class Alaskans, that approach me at various events I’m at to say things are just too difficult now, the policies that our current legislators have put in place have made life unaffordable, just on the basics like food and rent and on the larger but just as important things such as health care. And so, when the budget was recently passed and it really just put the hammer on people who are working hard to get by, I felt it was my time to raise my hands. Each time someone approached me and said, ‘Why doesn’t somebody do something?’ I felt like they were telling me it’s time to do this.
Brooks: So this has been in the works for a few months, a few weeks, or when did you make the go-ahead decision?
Schultz: A few months. It’s a long process of decision-making that includes talking, not only to trusted family members and mentors, but also people who are very politically savvy and professional in this world and seeking for and receiving the blessing of other people that I work with.
Brooks: I imagine it’ll take some sacrifice from your everyday life. What do you have to change in order to be able to run as a pastor?
Schultz: Well, I don’t think I’m ever going to watch television again. (coughs) Excuse me, I got a frog in my throat there. Maybe I’m mourning the loss of “Severance” there. 
But yeah, definitely. A lot of my free time, which previously had been much more flexible and relaxed, I’ve decided to no longer have that, but you raise a good point that I am still running as a pastor, and so there are certain things I’m not going to sacrifice. I am really willing to sacrifice rest, and I’m willing to sacrifice free time, and I’m willing to sacrifice comfort, but I’m not willing to sacrifice my values and ethics. So I’m campaigning as someone who is a pastor and will behave as such. I’m going to be kind and I’m going to build bridges. I’m going to cooperate and try my best to build something better.
Brooks: And were there people that you found especially helpful when you were organizing, getting ready to run. Whose advice did you rely on? 
Schultz: That’s a good question. I don’t know that I feel comfortable naming names, per se. You know, I don’t have other people’s permission to do that, but I will say, throughout my whole life, my wife has been a huge guide for me, and she and I discern our personal lives, our spiritual lives and our public lives side by side. We’ve always been a team. So that would be the biggest one. 
In addition to that, due to my work throughout different social advocacy things that I’ve been doing throughout the community, I’ve gotten to know a lot of different elected officials and people who have run for many offices and won a lot of offices, also people who are highly influential in the nonprofit sector and in the unions. Just by nature of the work that I do, I become friends with a lot of them, and I ran this by just about all of them. I ranked up an awful lot of phone time and got a lot of feedback.
Brooks: I know you mainly through your writing in the Anchorage Daily News, which you’ve done since 1999, but I understand you moved to Alaska in 1997. Can you give me a little bit of your biography? How you ended up here? 
Schultz: I’d be happy to, but I want to clarify a word I just used. I used the word feedback, and I want to make sure you know that for me, feedback means conversation, I wasn’t saying, like pushback. I got a lot of encouragement primarily, and that was a wonderful thing, along with constructive help with how I can improve. Just to be clear with my words.
Schultz: So, some of my background. Yes, we moved up here in 1997. We left about four years after that to go to graduate school and to work in a couple of other spots. We came back in 2013 because, like so many people, we discovered that you just can’t leave Alaska. The moment we left, we said, we have to get back there. Somehow. We have to find a way back.
Unfortunately, at that time, there was no educational opportunity for us in our chosen career, and we hear so many families saying the same thing, that they just wish there were a way for their kids to graduate high school and stay here and build a life and not have to leave for college or for trade school or for opportunities to build a career and build a family here, but like them, we had no options, so we had to find another place. 
We’re really grateful that we found a way back here. It worked out wonderfully. And we said, as soon as we got here, we’re never leaving again, we are all in.
Brooks: I was reading Iris’ article, and she had said you were raised in rural New York. Were you born in New York and came here; were you born and raised there?
Schultz: Yeah, I was born and raised in a place that had more cows than it had people, and spent every day playing with my friends on the farms. And there was a GE plant nearby, which most of my school members and their parents were involved with, and when that hit hard times, so many of us got laid off.
They were hard-working, some of the kindest people you will ever meet in your life. It was a great place. I found it was a giant world that I wanted to go explore, the great land. So I found my own path, but it was a good place to be. 
Brooks: What made you join the ministry?
Schultz: Wow, a lot of things. At the simplest level, I’ve just always felt the call. And I know that’s pretty vague, but honestly, it’s true. I’ve always felt that the spiritual life was important. I have always appreciated how the calling is based on caring for other people, being of service to individuals and communities and the world. 
A fun little factoid about me is that my dad was a Catholic priest and my mom was a Catholic nun, and they got married and excommunicated in the same moment.
So that’s kind of funny. So I sort of inherited the family business, in a way, but I chose a different path slightly. 
Brooks: Yeah, and you mentioned your wife. Do you have any kids?
Schultz: We do. We have three kids, and two of them are grown and out of the house, and the third is in high school. 
Brooks: In high school there in Anchorage or elsewhere?
Schultz: Yeah, in Anchorage.
Brooks: And then, if you were elected to Congress, you’d be — I’m thinking of Gabriel Warnock of Georgia — Is he the only other pastor? Do you know? If not, that’s OK. 
Schultz: No, there are three or four others, and they are in both parties and more than one denomination. And over the course of the history of Congress, there have been dozens and dozens. So there’s quite a bit of precedent for this, and to my knowledge, there have never been real major issues with it, or even minor issues. It’s got a long history behind it of being fine. 
So I wish you know, in some ways, it’d be cool to say I’m the first but it’s actually something that’s been done a lot, and it works out just fine. 
Brooks: And how does that affect the policies you would pursue as an elected official? I imagine the values that you hold now would be values you carry forward, so that’s why I ask. 
Schultz: Thank you for asking. I love the question, and I think that I’m really lucky that the values I have and hold dear seem to be the values that most Alaskan voters are looking for, and that’s a lot of courage to stand up for what’s right. 
That’s honesty, that’s the not just the willingness, but the drive to be constructive in Congress, to go there and work with people who might disagree with us, but still work together to build a community that serves all Alaskans, and in the broader sense, at the federal level, that also serves all Americans. 
I’ll be focusing on Alaska needs, of course. And in order to do that, they want to send people to Congress who have a spirit of service and cooperation. So we can work in a bipartisan way and get the values in there that are common to Democrats and Republicans and independents and undeclared voters. There are so many foundational values that we all share, and we should be building on those.
Brooks: What do you think is the biggest issue right now? The biggest problem is that you would like to fix or address? 
Schultz: Well, you asked me for one, but I’m going to give you two. I would say the affordability of life, just the cost of living, and the way the economy is not currently structured to serve people who are working hard for a living. 
The economy right now and the government also are geared toward helping millionaires. Personally, I don’t bump into a lot of millionaires, and I’m not a millionaire myself, so I want to address the way that the system is rigged to hurt working-class people only in the attempt to help millionaires. We need to change that system for sure.
The other one, it goes right along with it. It’s really — they’re really two sides of the same coin —  but the cost and the accessibility of health care have just become out of reach for too many people. Not only are people getting booted off their care at the moment, but it’s something along the lines of more than 40,000 Alaskans might lose their care, and then also the premiums are about to skyrocket, and some are already starting to feel that increase.
It shouldn’t be this way. People shouldn’t avoid going for necessary treatment just because they’re afraid they’re going to lose their house because they can’t pay the rent now that they bought their medicine. 
So those things do certainly go hand in hand, but they’re both so major and important that I like to speak about each of them. And I think once we’ve done those, once we have really chopped away at that, we’ll start to see people able to build a life again and to have time to thrive and be healthy and spend time with their loved ones without all the anxiety that the current policies have dropped on them.
Brooks: And I saw a short video that Andrew Gray had posted online. He had said it was from your first official campaign event, and it got me thinking. What are your plans for a campaign? How do you intend to get out and about, because it’s not easy to do here in Alaska. 
So what do you see yourself doing here in this first month, for example?
Schultz: Yeah, it’s not easy, but it’s awesome. You know, like most of the things that we do up here when we try to travel around and enjoy Alaska, it takes some effort, but it’s always worth it. So I do intend to get to just as many places as I can. I’m going to be traveling to Fairbanks really soon to go visit lots of friends and good folks up there. 
We’re going to try to get out to rural Alaska as often as possible. I think a big part of the work of being a pastor is very similar to a big part of the work of trying to get elected and serving the people as representative. And that is, you show up, you meet with people, you talk with people, you learn the joy of knowing these people. And most of all, you listen. 
I don’t know how it’s possible to be a representative that doesn’t show up for things like town halls and to listen to the people’s concerns, so I will definitely be doing that as much as possible. 
Brooks: Is there anything I haven’t asked you in in our short time here, that that you wish I had, or something that you think I should know?
Schultz: Boy, that’s a great question. I wish I could give you like a 25-minute speech, but I don’t want to lump that on you. 
Brooks: I’d take it if you did. 
Schultz: No, I know my (campaign manager) is listening in and she’s probably wanting me to not do that, but I will say that I feel that so many Alaskans have approached me — it’s got to be in the hundreds have approached me — to say that they are sick and tired of politics that are geared towards serving the wealthy, and they’re sick and tired of politics that are geared toward attacking the other party instead of learning how to work with the other party to build a better future together. 
It’s as if we’re the passengers in the back seat of a car, and in the front are two people we don’t know and we don’t trust, and they’re punching each other instead of taking us where we’re supposed to go.
And I think it’s time for us to make a change there.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)When state lawmakers approved a record-high $58.8 billion annual budget in June, watchdogs warned that they failed to protect New Jersey from a “financial storm” sure to ravage state coffers as federal funding cuts mount.
Now, researchers warn that a literal storm or some other disaster could decimate New Jersey’s cash reserves — and threaten other state services — if the federal government follows through on President Donald Trump’s vow to shift the burden of disaster recovery to states.
In a new report this week, Pew Charitable Trust researchers placed New Jersey among the states most at risk of financial trouble if disaster strikes, given dwindling federal assistance for catastrophes. Researchers listed New Jersey second nationally in federal relief as a share of its reserves, in a ranking of states by their highest single-year federal disaster aid since 2003 (excluding Louisiana and Mississippi, where Hurricane Katrina skewed data).
The current New Jersey budget has a $6.7 billion surplus. The state received the most federal disaster aid since 2003 in 2012, when the feds gave the Garden State $7.6 billion (adjusted for inflation) for Hurricane Sandy relief, according to Pew. If a similar storm hit today and the federal government provided no aid, it would entirely wipe out the state’s reserves.
Many states are similarly unprepared to cover the gap slashed federal disaster aid would create, said Colin Foard, a Pew project director and one of the report’s authors. State lawmakers scrounging to cover recovery costs that exceed their state’s reserves could eyeball other budget items to close the gap, putting an untold number of state services at risk, he added.
“The most catastrophic disasters would exceed or severely deplete state reserves,” Foard said. “We found that on average, federal disaster assistance equaled single-digit percentages of total state spending, but in the context of state budgets, even that relatively small amount is equal to important state investments.”
While states’ reserves hit new records in recent years, states won’t have such a cushion going forward, given that federal pandemic assistance has waned, along with record revenue collected in the wake of the pandemic, Foard added.
“These reserves are not meant exclusively for disaster purposes. They’re also meant to be states’ first line of defense against any unexpected spending or revenue shortfalls, or, for example, economic downturns. So any depletion of reserves for disaster purposes would limit states’ ability to use those savings for other purposes,” he said.
New Jersey’s reserves topped $10 billion in fiscal year 2024, and the current surplus is among the largest in state history. Still, revenue increases in the current state budget aren’t expected to cover spending, and budget experts have warned the state faces growing deficits. Experts differ on how long the state’s reserves could cover its operations, saying the state has enough to fund anywhere from a month of operations to not even a single day.
Compounding matters is the uncertainty states also face about federal funding beyond disaster aid, Foard added.

New Jersey receives, on average, $506 million a year in federal disaster aid, according to the report. That accounted for just over 0.9% of the state’s general fund expenditures last year, putting New Jersey 15th nationally in how big a share federal disaster aid represents of a state’s budget, the report says.
The Pew researchers urged federal policymakers, before cutting disaster aid, to consider states’ limitations in having savings on hand and the trade-offs states would have to make to cover more of the cost of disasters.
States should more robustly plan and budget for disasters, “as opposed to building the airplane while it’s flying,” Foard said.
That means states should more comprehensively track and report disaster spending, proactively budget for disaster costs, and invest in risk reduction, he added.
“The thing about disaster assistance as a policy priority for states is that it demands immediate response,” Foard said. “If a disaster happens and people are in danger or suffering, the resources need to be there quickly to assist them.”
New Jersey legislators have already tried to bolster the state’s disaster preparedness, but bills that would establish a $250 million disaster relief grant program and track disaster spending by state and local governments remain stalled in the Statehouse.
Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) has introduced the bill to track disaster spending every legislative session since 2018. He doesn’t expect it will move this session either, considering legislators have just about six weeks or so to wrap up loose legislative ends before the current session ends in January.
Disaster preparedness can be a political football, with the rarity of massive calamities, the many demands on public funds, and developers fighting proposed restrictions intended to minimize storm impacts, Zwicker said.
“We are just too often reactive,” he said of disasters.
But the increasing frequency of catastrophic storms that can devastate coastal states like New Jersey, especially, should spur lawmakers to action, Zwicker said. There’s even more urgency now, given the disparate impact of federal funding cuts, he added.
“The Trump administration is targeting blue states. Blue states like New Jersey are arguably the most vulnerable state in the Northeast when it comes to a weather-related disaster event in our future,” he said.
His bill, in particular, should move, because it merely requires data tracking and “data should be apolitical,” he said. Budgeting for disaster preparedness and recovery could be a tougher sell, he conceded, especially if the state’s surplus dries up and forces future state leaders to choose between making draconian cuts or raising taxes to cover the state’s varied needs.
“Whoever wins this governor’s race is going to be handed a very difficult budget. It’s only going to get more and more difficult,” he said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)For the third time since 2022, the Oglala Sioux Tribe has sued the federal government over inadequate funding for its reservation’s public safety operations.
The case filed last week in U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota alleges that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs has yet to address the shortage of officers the tribe initially sued over in 2022. It also says the BIA’s justice division once again denied requests to fund school resource officers, a canine unit, an internal affairs division and a Missing and Murdered Indigenous People investigation unit in federal fiscal year 2025, which began at the start of last October.
The other two cases, filed in 2022 and 2024, were consolidated as one in July. Those issues remain unresolved, and nothing has been filed by the tribe or the federal government since they were combined.
Treaty obligations for the federal government form the foundation for all three of the lawsuits. The first treaty that committed the U.S. government to provide for the safety of Oglala Sioux Tribal members was signed in 1825, and the commitment was reaffirmed in treaties signed in 1851 and 1868.
Law enforcement issues unresolved following Oglala Lakota lawsuit

“It is the foundation of the trust obligation owed by Defendants to the Tribe to provide adequate and effective law enforcement services,” the new lawsuit says.
According to the U.S. Census, around 20,000 people live in the borders of the tribe’s Pine Ridge Reservation, which has a land area approximately the size of Connecticut. The tribe has around 50,000 enrolled members nationwide.
Some tribes in South Dakota, like Crow Creek, rely exclusively on BIA police for law enforcement. Oglala is one of the six tribes in South Dakota that maintains its own police force using BIA funding. 
In the 1990s, the force had around 150 officers. Today, there are around 30 tribal police. The tribe argues that the loss in officers dates back to 1999. The BIA altered its funding calculations that year, setting a base funding level that hasn’t changed since, the lawsuit says. The agency factored in funding provided through police-specific federal grants when it set that level, but those grants ceased to pay Oglala Sioux Tribal Police officer salaries in 2006. 
The tribe’s lawsuit says the BIA has never moved to replace the grant funding.
The result, the tribe says, has been long wait times for citizens who call 911 — sometimes longer than 30 minutes — and an unworkable case load for police, who often respond without backup. 
“Many E-911 calls for police service are abandoned, are not being responded to in the time required to ensure public safety or are not being properly investigated or prosecuted because there simply are not enough police officers,” the lawsuit says.
There were 165,000 calls for service in 2023. Those calls included 1,133 assaults, 1,245 domestic violence calls, 589 calls related to guns and 653 missing person reports. The figures are updates to similar statistics that appeared in the cases filed in 2022 and 2024.
The case also again points to specific areas of policing the tribe has asked for but never received.
The tribe requested $31.1 million for public safety in fiscal year 2025, including amounts for missing people, school policing, a canine unit and an office of internal affairs to manage misconduct allegations against officers. 
In response, the new case says, the BIA sent the tribe a letter saying it could offer $4.2 million, which was the same amount offered in fiscal year 2024. 
Similar requests were made in previous years, and are noted in the earlier lawsuits.
The new case again asks a judge to order the Department of Interior to fund the additional units the tribe proposed for 2025 and increase base funding enough to staff the Oglala Sioux Tribal Police Department at a ratio of 2.8 officers per 1,000 residents. It also demands an accounting of the BIA’s past funding decisions, and for an injunction to immediately stop the agency from continuing to use a 1999 base funding level as a starting point for policing budget requests, and a declaration that the federal government has failed to meet its treaty obligations.
Emails to Oglala Sioux Tribal President Frank Star Comes Out, the tribe’s lawyers, and a spokesperson from the BIA were not immediately returned Wednesday.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/591A9855-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-22 15:17:23.966496

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature anticipates a special session in January to formally earmark federal health care funding that is expected to be awarded by the end of the year. But lawmakers will not be able to make any changes to how those funds are spent. 
That plan is being crafted by the Department of Health and Human Services, with input from a 33-member legislative committee, and is due to the federal government on Nov. 5. Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the department, said she believes the federal government will expect North Dakota to adhere to that plan.
“Once the plan is into (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services), it can only be slightly adjusted,” Aker said. 
The department’s application will determine how $500 million in federal funds for rural health care will be spent over the next five years. 
North Dakota won’t promise to spend 5% of federal health funds on tribal communities

The Legislature’s role during the special session will be to formally appropriate the dollars received from the federal government. But lawmakers will not have the ability to debate and change how the money will be spent. 
“We can’t just decade ‘Well, we don’t like spending $50 million in this category. We’re going to spend $50 million here,’” said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, the Republican from Williston chairing the committee. “We have to work within that framework.”
Aker said the federal government is planning to announce the final funding amounts to each state by the end of the year.
“Hopefully we’ll be getting a nice Christmas gift from the federal government,” Aker said. 
The special session will likely happen soon after, Rep. Don Vigesaa said. 
“The department is hoping that it’s in January, as soon after the awards are made as possible so they can get rolling on the process,” the Republican from Cooperstown said in an interview. 
Sen. Jeff Magrum, a Republican from Hazelton, noted the vote on the funding “will just be a rubber stamp.”
Bill drafts
The interim Rural Health Transformation Committee voted to move forward on four bill drafts to be considered during the special session. 
These bills contain policy changes that will improve the state’s eligibility for supplemental federal funding beyond the baseline $500 million per state.
The policy changes include: 

Requiring K-12 students to participate in the Presidential Physical Fitness Test that was eliminated by President Barack Obama and is in the process of being reinstituted by President Donald Trump. 
Require doctors to have continuing education on nutrition.
Have North Dakota join a multi-state physician assistant licensure compact, making it easier for one state’s PA to practice in another state.
Allow pharmacists to conduct laboratory tests and prescribe medications for certain conditions. 

The committee advanced the bills to the Legislative Management interim committee, which will decide whether the bills should move forward. If the committee approves the bills, the drafts will return to the Rural Health Transformation Committee for debate and potential amendments before being presented to the full Legislature during the special session. 
Several lawmakers said the bill empowering pharmacists with limited prescription authority will require significant changes before they are comfortable endorsing it. 
“There’s a lot of room for improvement,” said Rep. Eric Murphy, a Republican from Grand Forks. 
North Dakota aims for more federal health funds with 4 policy changes

Sen. Kristin Roers, a Republican from Fargo, said she would like to see the bill significantly reduced in scope. Any more significant policy changes can wait until 2027 to go through the normal legislative process, she said. 
“This version of this bill draft is a regular session bill,” Roers said. 
Other legislation may also be proposed during the special session, Vigesaa said, though he expects legislative leadership to try and limit bills on other subjects.
“If the governor calls us in, which I believe he will do, other subjects could be brought up for legislative discussion,” Vigesaa said. “I think that leadership will probably try to limit that, if at all possible, and just stick to the purpose, which is the allocation of these funds.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican leaders in the Indiana Senate say they don’t currently have the votes needed to pursue a mid-decade redraw of the state’s congressional map — a setback for Gov. Mike Braun and national Republicans who have been pushing for new lines ahead of the 2026 midterm election cycle.
“The votes aren’t there for redistricting,” said Molly Swigart, spokeswoman for the Indiana Senate Republican caucus, in a statement Wednesday.

The comment, first reported by Politico, underscores a weeks-long impasse that’s attracted national attention. President Donald Trump and other top GOP officials have eyed Indiana as a potential opportunity to pick up one or two additional Republican seats in the U.S. House. They hope to maintain control after the midterms.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle has tracked public statements from lawmakers on the proposal. So far, just four Senate Republicans have come out in favor of a mid-cycle redistricting plan, while three have said they oppose it. The remaining members of the 40-strong caucus are either undecided or have not made definitive statements.
Braun, who has publicly supported redrawing the congressional map, countered Wednesday by saying he is still in talks with lawmakers. 
“I am still having positive conversations with members of the legislature,” Braun said in a post on X. “I am confident the majority of Indiana Statehouse Republicans will support efforts to ensure fair representation in congress for every Hoosier.”
The Republican governor spoke at a mental health summit Wednesday afternoon in Indianapolis but did not take questions from the media after his remarks.
Republicans still split
Calls for redistricting have divided the state GOP caucus in recent months. 
Sen. Liz Brown, the Senate’s assistant majority floor leader and Judiciary Committee chair, reiterated her support on social media Wednesday. 
“I was the first Senator to publicly support redistricting back in August,” she wrote. “@GovBraun, call us into session! Let’s get this done! ”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks in the Indiana Senate on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
She said, too, that Hoosiers should “call your Senator, State Rep, and educate others on the need to redistrict.”
Brown is also running a radio ad in support of redistricting in Fort Wayne.
Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, who also serves as president of the Senate, additionally issued a lengthy statement Wednesday sharply criticizing members of his own party for hesitating on the issue.
“The people of Indiana did not elect a Republican supermajority so our Senate could cower, compromise, or collapse at the very moment courage is required,” Beckwith wrote, calling on GOP senators to “find your backbone” and back a “9-0 conservative map.”
The development drew an immediate response from Indiana’s Democratic leaders, who reiterated their opposition to early redistricting.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, a Democrat from Fort Wayne, said Wednesday that lawmakers should focus on other priorities.
“Nobody is asking for redistricting. Instead, Hoosiers are asking their elected leaders to fix their high utility bills, property taxes and absurd health care costs,” GiaQuinta said. “House Democrats have received massive amounts of calls against redistricting, and I’m sure the Senate Republicans have, too. I’ll continue to monitor the possibility of redistricting until we end the 2026 legislative session in March.”










Hoosiers do not want mid-decade redistricting. Thank you to the state senators who are listening and refusing to vote for it.


– Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn


The Statehouse’s GOP supermajorities drew the current maps in 2021, using 2020 census data. District boundaries aren’t due for updates until after the 2030 census.
In the Indiana General Assembly, a constitutional majority is required to pass a bill. That means at least 26 votes in the Senate and at least 51 votes in the House. Republicans currently hold 40 seats in the Senate and 67 seats in the House.
Voting rights advocates praised holdout GOP senators.
“Hoosiers do not want mid-decade redistricting. Thank you to the state senators who are listening and refusing to vote for it,” Common Cause Indiana Executive Director Julia Vaughn said Wednesday. “Now, let’s wave the checkered flag and end this talk about mid decade redistricting. Time to make it clear — no special session, no mid-decade redistricting, and no more bullying by the federal government on a policy Hoosiers oppose.”
Pushback continues











The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus earlier this week condemned the early redistricting effort as “diluting Black voting power” and “undermining the democratic process.”











The current map gives Republicans a 7-2 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation. 
National Republican strategists have argued that shifting boundaries — particularly in the 7th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. André Carson, but also in northwest Indiana’s 1st District, represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan — could make those seats more competitive for the GOP heading into 2026.
Legislative caucus condemns early redistricting campaign for ‘diluting Black voting power’

Several conservative commentators and social media influencers reacted negatively to the latest news on Wednesday.
One national strategist — Rogan O’Handley — said “We want NAMES Who are the RINO holdouts in Indiana who don’t want to redistrict to save this country They’re about to be real famous.”
He also speculated former Vice President and Indiana native Mike Pence is pulling strings against the redistricting.
“Is former Indiana Governor Mike Pence trying to get revenge on the MAGA movement that he backstabbed on J6 and telling Rodric Bray jot to redistrict? Hmmm. That’s what we’re hearing!”
The setback comes after weeks of speculation in the Statehouse, fueled by a series of meetings between Hoosier GOP leaders and top figures in Trump’s orbit, including Vice President JD Vance. 
The president has been personally engaged in lobbying Indiana Senate Republicans, including joining a private call with members of the Senate GOP caucus as recently as Friday to push for the remap.
Discussions have centered on ways to strengthen the party’s position in the U.S. House — where Republicans hold a narrow majority — by encouraging  states with GOP strongholds to redraw districts before 2026.
House Speaker Todd Huston and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, both Republicans, have refused to publicly say where they stand.

Indiana’s GOP legislative leaders have met at least three times with Vance in recent months. Bray described the latest conversation as “productive,” though he stopped short of confirming whether Senate Republicans were united behind an early redraw.
Braun has maintained that his goal is to “let the legislature lead.” He has repeatedly said that he’ll wait to call lawmakers back until they signal readiness, telling reporters in August, “You’re going to hear individual representatives and senators speak up … That process will take a while to play out.”
But Braun also warned that “if we try to drag our feet as a state on it, probably, we’ll have consequences of not working with the Trump administration as tightly as we should.”
If a special session is not called, the next regularly scheduled legislative session will kick off in January. Candidate filing for the 2026 primary opens Jan. 7.
Multiple polls — including one released in August and one earlier this month — have found that the majority of Hoosiers oppose early redistricting.
One statewide survey found that a majority of Hoosiers — about 53% — oppose early redistricting, compared to just 34% who support it. Another survey showed waning trust in both parties, with growing numbers of voters saying they feel disconnected from state political leadership.

But it’s a critical piece of how the 36-year-old single mom can put food on the table.
Or at least, it was. Robertson is among the 42 million low-income people nationwide, including 140,000 Rhode Islanders, who stand to lose federal food assistance if the federal government fails to reopen by Nov. 1. In Rhode Island, the payments from the federally funded program amount to $29 million a month, or $348 million a year, according to Gov. Dan McKee’s office.
Shutdown likely to halt food benefits for 42 million in just days

“I am nervous,” Robertson, who lives in Providence, said Wednesday as she stood in line at Good Neighbors Community Kitchen and Food Pantry in East Providence’s Riverside section. “I really don’t know what I will do.”
Federal officials first put out the alert on Oct. 1 that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will run out of money at the end of the month if Congress fails to pass a spending bill and end the government shutdown. The warnings intensified in another notice Oct. 10, with state administrators directed not to begin issuing payments to vendors ahead of the regular, Nov. 1 distribution.
Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means benefits would likely be delayed.










I am nervous. I really don’t know what I will do. 


– Yolanda Robertson, a Providence resident who receives federal food assistance 


The funding shortfall has gotten enough hype to trend on TikTok, which is how Robertson found out a few days ago.
“I was shocked,” she said. “I kind of can’t believe it.”
Her short-term solution: fill her shelves with as much additional food as she can from local food pantries. She’s not the only one with these plans.
Food pantries across Rhode Island have reported record numbers of clients served in recent weeks, including more frequent visits by the same people, as the prospect of cuts to federal food assistance looms.

Stocking up
Newport’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center ran out of hot food during breakfast Tuesday morning — the first time Executive Director Heather Hole Strout could ever recall. People got fed thanks to a backup supply of frozen breakfast sandwiches, cereal and fruit, but Strout was shocked by the sudden bump in attendance.
A few hours later, during the Newport nonprofit’s Tuesday lunch, a record crowd returned, again too many for the amount of hot food available. Another group packed the center’s lobby, shoulder-to-shoulder as they waited for the noon opening of the food pantry.
“It’s definitely very typical of what happens when there is a shortage or something is going to be lost,” Strout said. “People try to get ahead of it. We’re seeing a lot of people trying to conserve what they have, and get to the food pantry before this happens.”

A majority of those helped by the food pantry and community meal programs also receive federal food assistance. But the monthly stipends — which vary based on income level, the number of children or a disability — aren’t enough for most people to live on, prompting many to turn to community programs.
A continued shutdown, and the lapse of SNAP, will only increase the demand on community food pantries, already struggling to plan amid food and funding shortages and limited physical space. 
“We have a plan in place, but at the same time, you can’t totally plan for something when you don’t know whether it’s going to happen or not,” Strout said. “We can’t have dozens more pallets of food in a building that doesn’t hold more food.”

The Rhode Island Community Food Bank funnels state and federal funding and private donations to food pantries across the state. The 89,000 people served last month at local food pantries is the highest on record, its executive director, Melissa Cherney, said.
“We’re doing the best we can but we’re really strapped, with less food than last year serving more people,” Cherney said. 
None of its member food pantries have had to turn any clients away. At least, not yet.
“That is still a real possibility,” Cherney said. 
New work requirements 
Nov. 1 also marks a change in eligibility for the federal food assistance program, with new work requirements that could cause older adults, homeless people and veterans, to suddenly lose access to benefits. Information on the number of SNAP recipients in Rhode Island affected by the changes was not immediately available.
But Nessa Richman forecasts chaos from the combination of sudden, stringent proof-of-work paperwork and a government shutdown.
“This is an unprecedented crisis,” Richman, executive director for the Rhode Island Food Policy Council, said. “We haven’t seen impacts on the SNAP program like this ever.” 
McKee organized a meeting with municipal leaders Monday to begin local efforts to assist food banks. The governor’s office is also working on its own plan that would “leverage state funding with community partners and philanthropic organizations” to boost food supplies, according to a statement from McKee’s office Monday. The governor’s office did not respond to inquiries for comment on what this plan entailed, or what progress has been reached on Wednesday.
However, McKee made clear that the “astronomical” cost for the program is not one the state can absorb on its own.
Kate Mushipi, executive director at Good Neighbors, was confident that partner agencies and community donations would ensure the East Providence food pantry and kitchen could continue to feed everyone who needed it. But, she acknowledged that smaller pantries, without as many community partners, might not be so fortunate.
Beyond providing food and funding, food pantries have also become a critical source of education and information on the daily, sometimes hourly, changes in what’s coming down from Washington.  
Robin Covington, a board member for Good Neighbors who also works at United Way of Rhode Island, came to Wednesday morning’s food pantry with an array of informational brochures and buttons, ready to answer questions and connect clients to other support systems.

Most food pantry clients knew at least a little about the shutdown and the new work requirements. But some were confused about the details, or just looking for some reassurance. 
“We’re comforting, we’re helping them make a plan, to know what’s available,” Covington explained. “I think it’s just starting to hit that this is real.” 
‘Emergency mindset’
An air of resignation hung heavy in the basement dining room, as clients lingered over cups of coffee and donuts while waiting for a turn in the pantry line. 
“I think people are already in that emergency mindset,” said Abby AlSasah, a volunteer. “This is just another thing they have to deal with.”
Corey Santos, 73, shrugged when asked about the prospect of losing the $280 in monthly federal food assistance that supports him and his adult daughter, Taneka.
“We’ll just have to deal with it,” he said. “It’s terrible. But what can we do?”
But there were signs of joy, too — greetings between regulars, talk of pets and children, and the prospect of a hot meal.
Wednesday’s lunch menu featured ground turkey pasta — acceptable, but not the top choice for Arthur Donnelly, 67. He prefers the sloppy joes.
“On those days, I bring my own barbecue sauce,” Donnelly said.

(Photo courtesy of Gender Justice)The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that USA Powerlifting discriminated against a Minnesota transgender athlete by prohibiting transgender women from participating in weightlifting events.
The court, however, asked a lower court to weigh in on whether USA Powerlifting’s discrimination is “reasonably necessary for it to achieve its central mission,” as the law allows.
The court said JayCee Cooper’s human rights were violated when USA Powerlifting refused to let her compete as a woman in two powerlifting competitions in 2018. When Cooper applied to compete in the competition, USA Powerlifting barred transgender women from competing in the women’s division.
Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Natalie Hudson wrote the court’s unanimous decision, which was narrowly tailored around the Minnesota Human Rights Act and its prohibition against discrimination in business and specifically public accommodations.
“We agree with Cooper that USA Powerlifting’s policy is discriminatory on its face; there is therefore no genuine dispute that USA Powerlifting discriminated against Cooper because of her transgender status,” Hudson wrote.
But the Minnesota Human Rights Act has an exemption for businesses that show that a “discriminatory policy is reasonably necessary for it to achieve its central mission and there are no reasonable alternatives.”
The justices said that USA Powerlifting argued successfully that it could have a legitimate business reason.
USA Powerlifting said its transgender policy is necessary to uphold the fairness of weightlifting competitions, as transgender women powerlifters have “increased body and muscle mass, bone density, bone structure and connective tissues.” Therefore, the policy is necessary for their business, USA Powerlifting argued, because their members must have confidence in the integrity of the competition.
The justices sent the question back to the Ramsey County District Court for further consideration.
Gender Justice, which helped represent Cooper, said that the public accommodations ruling was a major win for their client.
“This ruling sends a clear and powerful message: transgender people have a right to enjoy public spaces in Minnesota like sporting events, restaurants and movie theaters, free from targeted discrimination,” Jess Braverman, legal director at Gender Justice, said in a statement. “This decision is a historic victory for fairness, equity, and the fundamental rights of all Minnesotans.”
Wednesday’s ruling arrived in a fraught political climate for transgender Americans and athletes, as President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports, as well other anti-trans executive orders.
Minnesota is also under scrutiny for its transgender athlete policies in education, as the feds last month found Minnesota in violation of Title IX. Wednesday’s ruling doesn’t apply to school sports, as the Minnesota Supreme Court issued a ruling based on public accommodations, not Title IX.
Republicans in Minnesota quickly denounced the Supreme Court’s ruling.
“This issue is ultimately about safety and fairness, and Minnesotans overwhelmingly agree that their daughters and granddaughters should not be forced to compete against boys,” House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, said in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Copy-of-JAYCEE_5.0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-22 15:01:21.060728

The organization will seek  $135 million from the Legislature in January to meet increased demand for affordable housing and expected cuts to weatherization programs. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)After significant federal housing-related changes, the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority is planning to ask lawmakers to give it $135 million in the January 2026 legislative session, funding that would build on hundreds of millions of dollars the Legislature has spent on housing in recent years. 
The organization, which rebranded last year as Housing New Mexico, operates as a quasi-governmental agency that oversees hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to spur affordable housing development, as well as help New Mexicans afford to buy or rent. 
The funding would benefit Housing NM’s Housing Trust Fund, which issues loans and grants for an array of programs — including down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers—enabling it to serve up to 5,200 New Mexicans, according to a cost breakdown in a recent presentation.
While the Legislature has allocated more than $160 million for the fund in the last several sessions, current federal and economic factors justify the increased ask, said Housing NM’s Policy Director Robyn Powell.
Housing summit speaker: NM home shortage could be as high as 90,000 units

For instance, the federal budget bill enacted by President Donald Trump last summer included a 12% increase in funding for tax credits that incentivize the construction or major rehabilitation of affordable housing projects. As a result, the demand for the supplemental funding Housing NM provides is expected to increase from $40 million to $70 million, according to a presentation Powell gave to the agency’s board last week 
Meanwhile, Powell told Source New Mexico in a recent interview that she is concerned the federal Housing and Urban Development agency will claw back funding that helps low-income households pay for utilities or weatherize their homes. As a result, she is hoping the Legislature will provide the Housing Trust Fund more resources to help cover some of those losses, she said. 
Housing New Mexico’s board approved the request last week. On Thursday, a legislative oversight committee will consider whether to endorse the request ahead of the 30-day session beginning in January.
Housing New Mexico leaders say they can spend money quickly out of the Housing Trust Fund, and also that putting money in the fund is a good investment, given how much of the fund’s offerings are low-interest loans that return to the fund. 
“The more investment that the state can do, the better for everybody,” Powell told Source New Mexico in a recent interview, given the state’s housing shortage estimated to be as many as 90,000 units.

(Florida House photo by Meredith Geddings) The advocacy organization Stand for Health Freedom on Wednesday endorsed former state House Speaker Paul Renner for governor.
“Paul Renner has consistently demonstrated the courage to defend Florida families and uphold the principle that parents, not the government, make decisions for their children. His record shows a clear understanding that medical freedom and parental rights are inseparable from the liberty we all cherish,” said Bailey Kuykendoll, operations director and Florida state director for Stand for Health Freedom.
Renner, 58, served as speaker from 2022 through 2024 and helped Gov. Ron DeSantis steer through the Legislature a ban on gender-affirming care for minors; a six-week abortion ban; elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in state schools and universities; and expansion of school vouchers for all Florida families, regardless of income.
He also helped the governor push through limits on consumers’ ability to sue insurance companies.

“The COVID crisis led to an unprecedented expansion of power with the federal government literally attempting to take control of individual healthcare decisions,” Renner said.
“In Florida, we said ‘no,’ and when I was speaker of the House, we acted courageously to protect the rights of parents, patients, and individual citizens over healthcare decisions for themselves and their families.”
Renner is running in a GOP primary that includes U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, who has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
Renner, who reported earlier this month raising $3.7 million in about a month for his gubernatorial bid, has tried to pitch himself as someone who could appeal to supporters of DeSantis and provide an alternative to Donalds. DeSantis, however, has not endorsed anyone in the governor’s race and was not supportive of Renner’s decision to run, calling it “ill advised.”
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins is considering whether to run in the Republican primary, as well. DeSantis is leaving office in early 2027 due to term limits.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Heading into week four of the federal government shutdown, North Carolina Congresswoman Deborah Ross joined local food bank leaders in Raleigh on Wednesday to discuss food insecurity and SNAP benefits. 
Ross, a Democrat representing the state’s second congressional district since 2021, talked about food banks starting up for federal workers in the area. She said she heard the first one opened this week for airport employees.
While she has statistics on the number of federal employees in her district who are relying on food banks, the figures change every day due to the Trump administration firing people and placing them on furlough, Ross said. 
Kimberly Burrows, chief development officer at Inter-Faith Food Shuttle, described the situation as a “perfect storm.”

In addition to losing federal money, post-pandemic funding dried up as well. This leaves food banks unable to purchase produce from local farmers, leading to a loss of revenue for that group, who in turn come to the food pantries to get help for their families.
“We’re seeing an increase in need,” Burrows said. “While there are food drives, we’re seeing less being donated because people don’t have supplemental income to go and buy that extra box of macaroni when they’re at the grocery store.”
Since the start of the year, Ross has been to multiple food banks in the area. She said she knew the Trump administration would attack food programs because of similar proposals from his first term.
The programs under threat range from Meals on Wheels for seniors and the  Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program for pregnant women and newborns to food pantries for veterans and at North Carolina State University for students. 
“Food banks are a lifeline for so many families, and it crosses all political lines, urban, rural, and all sorts of situations,” Ross said. 
The government shutdown has exacerbated the situation in recent weeks. There was enough money for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which help low-income families, through October, but there may be disruptions in November.
The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services received a letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture warning of possible impacts, but has “not yet been told exactly what that means for North Carolina,” according to the agency’s website. 
In a news release last Friday, Gov. Josh Stein said NCDHHS does not currently have funding to continue WIC benefits past early November. There is no certainty that more funding is coming, he said. 
“It’s time for all elected officials to do their jobs and get government working like it should — for the people,” Stein said in the statement. 
There are 1.4 million people statewide who rely on SNAP to help feed their families, according to NCDHHS. More than 700,000 households receive benefits each month, and 80% of North Carolina families participating in SNAP have either a child, senior, or an adult with a disability.
There are about 582,569 children in the state who rely on SNAP as of Oct. 12, according to NCDHHS.
“This is a complete abdication of responsibility from our Republican Congress and our president,” Ross said. “It’s cruelty. It’s hitting people in the place that makes them feel the least secure, the ability to get the nutrition that they need at the times that they need it.”
“We should be back in session. We should be voting. We should be getting out federal budgets together. We should be taking care of the ACA tax credits,” Ross said. “But instead, here we are.”
Federal programs supply the lion’s share of food aid to the states. Without those federal funds, responsibility falls upon the states to supply money for these food programs. But North Carolina’s legislature hasn’t passed a budget yet this session. That pushes the burden down to counties, local organizations, and nonprofits, Ross said. 
State lawmakers have returned to Raleigh this week. Ross criticized Republican legislative leaders for focusing on redistricting rather than passing a budget with additional funding to help North Carolinians receive aid with food.
“In addition to not caring about our people’s food security and their health care, they don’t care about people’s right to fair representation, and so they’ve decided to redraw the maps in the eastern part of the state to get another Republican seat and erase more than 30 years of representation from northeastern North Carolina and predominantly African American rural areas,” she said.

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) The Iowa Board of Medicine is defending its decision to suspend the license of a physician assistant facing multiple criminal charges alleging he sexually assaulted female patients.
Late last year, the Iowa Board of Physician Assistants issued an emergency order suspending the license of James Haag, who was practicing occupational medicine at MercyOne’s Bluebell Road Family Medicine in Cedar Falls.
In its order, the board cited Haag’s “predatory actions towards his patients (that) constitute a threat to public health.” The board alleged Haag “sexually assaulted multiple patients in his care” and that he posed “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.” In April, the board concluded Haag’s conduct warranted a three-year suspension of his license.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Haag was also criminally charged in connection with the alleged assaults, and is currently facing two counts of third-degree sexual abuse, two counts of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse, and three counts of simple assault. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a trial, which had been scheduled for April and then September of this year, is now set for April 28, 2026.
With the criminal case still pending, Haag is seeking judicial review of the licensing board’s decision to suspend his license. Haag alleges the board “ignored the facts” that were presented at his disciplinary hearing.
“Fabricating testimony is apparently the depths to which the board is willing to sink to discount all evidence supporting Mr. Haag’s innocence,” Haag’s attorney alleges in court filings.
Haag’s petition seeks a court order overruling the board’s decision.
In a recently filed court brief responding to Haag’s claims, the board details the specific patient allegations that led to the license suspension and asserts that there is “ample evidence Haag inappropriately touched four of his patients in sexual manner.” The board also alleges that even if all of the factual discrepancies or contradictions in the case were settled in Haag’s favor, “his misconduct would still have been substantiated, and his license would still be suspended for three years.”
Board records show that as part of his work at Bluebell Road Family Medicine, Haag performed job-related physicals for individuals who worked at a local business.
Board cites testimony in disciplinary case 
The licensing board alleges that in July 2024, Haag examined four patients for purposes of their employment. In each case, the patients were allegedly instructed to disrobe and Haag conducted the initial portion of the exams without the presence of a nurse or other observer.
During the course of each examination, the board alleges, Haag removed each patient’s robe and “made physical contact” with the patients’ genitals. In some instances, the board alleges, he used his hands, while in others he “pressed his fully clothed pelvic area into the patient’s genitals or backside.”
The board alleges Haag also made “inappropriate contact with multiple patients’ breasts” during the course of their examinations. “In multiple instances, where the patients attempted to cover themselves, (Haag) swatted their hands away,” the board alleges.
At the February 2025 hearing on the licensing board charges, Haag testified that he always requests a female chaperone be in the room during a female hernia exam for his own “protection” since the procedure involves touching a woman’s lower pelvic area.
Hearing testimony indicated that while a chaperone entered the room during the four women’s physicals, it was typically after Haag had already performed the portion of the exam that was most concerning to the women.
In its most recent court brief, the board also notes that in some cases, the women reported the chaperone deliberately looked away during their exams, and the chaperone herself testified she looked at the walls or an exam-room cabinet during at least one of the women’s exams.
The brief quotes one of the female patients as expressing concern over the chaperone’s behavior. “This nurse, for whatever reason, when he went to check down there, she looked away … Why are you looking away? Why are you not watching, you know, what he is doing? … (She) stood by the bed and just looked away instantly.”
The board concluded that the four alleged victims were credible and consistent in their allegations.
“Haag used his position of power as a medical professional to inappropriately touch vulnerable female patients, patients that were required to undergo a physical in order to maintain employment,” the board stated in its ruling on Haag’s license suspension.

Jayme Davis, D-Rolette, speaks during a committee meeting on Oct. 15, 2025. At right is Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. (Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A committee of North Dakota lawmakers did not support a proposal this week that sought to guarantee at least 5% of federal rural health care funding go to the state’s tribal communities.
The state is drafting an application for $500 million in federal funding for rural health care in North Dakota that will be distributed over the next five years. North Dakota also is vying for additional funds.
Rep. Jayme Davis, a Democrat from Rollette, advocated during a committee meeting Tuesday for a motion that would have required 5% of that be allocated to tribal nations in the state each year. Davis, a citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, said the money is meant to address areas with the biggest funding disparities.
“It’s my people who have the biggest disparities in North Dakota,” Davis said.
Davis said she made the proposal in response to a formal resolution passed by chairs of the five tribal nations that share geography with the state. The 5% would be distributed in two ways: 60% equally split among the five tribes and 40% made available for targeted grants for tribal governments, tribal colleges and tribal health organizations. 
North Dakota lawmakers build wish list for $500M federal rural health care grant

Davis said she’s worried the funding will be awarded to health care organizations, especially those in larger communities, that already have resources and funding in place. 
“When really our rural communities, our tribal communities, really need this money, really need these funds to make a difference in what this whole thing is for,” Davis said after the meeting. “To address health care in rural America, in rural North Dakota.”
Half a dozen lawmakers voiced concerns about the proposal. Rep. Jon Nelson, a Republican from Rugby, said he hopes the funding distribution will result in more than 5% benefiting tribal members in the state without the need to set aside a certain amount. 
“I would be shocked and disappointed if only 5% of the funding would go towards programs that directly and indirectly affect tribes,” Nelson said. “I would think and I would hope and I would guarantee, as much as I have the ability to, that this process will be favorable to tribal communities without a set-aside.”
Sen. David Clemens said he thinks tribes will get their fair share. 
“I don’t feel it would be the right thing to allocate a certain amount to a certain segment of our society,” said Clemens, a Republican from West Fargo.
Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the Department of Health and Human Services, said allocating a set amount of the federal funding to the tribes would reduce the state’s flexibility in how it is allocated. North Dakota has to submit an application to the federal government by Nov. 5 detailing how the state plans to spend the money received over the next five years. Only limited modifications to the plan can be made once it is approved. 
Davis withdrew the motion asking for 5% to be set aside. In its place, Davis asked for tribal applications for grants to be given a 5% weighted increase in the formula evaluating how grants will be awarded. 
The committee adjourned without a vote on Davis’ second motion. 
The state will receive at least $500 million in federal funds for rural health care over the next five years. Each state is eligible for more funding based on certain state demographics and other criteria. 
The process for distributing that funding to organizations in the state has not been finalized. Aker mentioned there will likely be a combination of mechanisms, such as a formal procurement process and awarding grants based on applications, but the department is focused on minimizing any administrative burden for applicants to ensure smaller entities will feel able to apply for funds. 
Davis is asking for tribal representation on the committee that decides the grant awards. While Aker said her department has spent time connecting with tribal stakeholders and views the tribes as “partners,” Davis said it is important for a tribal representative to have a voice at the table. 
“Nobody knows us better than we know ourselves, and so we’re constantly fighting for that representation,” Davis said. “If I wasn’t in this committee, none of this would have happened…. It might have never even been an afterthought, and our tribes might have missed out on having this opportunity.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-22 18:11:00+00:00,CT Mirror,SNAP benefits poised to stop Nov. 1 despite CT hopes to continue,Keith M. Phaneuf and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/22/snap-benefits-ct/,"If SNAP funding dries up next month as threatened, that will put increasing pressure on Connecticut food pantries to fill the need.","Connecticut officials are bracing for a key federal nutrition assistance program to stop abruptly in 10 days, absent intervention from President Trump’s administration or an end to the federal government shutdown.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture sent states a memo on Oct. 10 warning “there will be insufficient funds to pay full November … benefits” in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.
But rather than directing states to issue partial benefits, the department directed them, effectively, to shut down the Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards that SNAP recipients use to purchase groceries.
That means these cards won’t gain any new purchasing power starting Nov. 1, and any unused benefits also can’t be accessed after Oct. 31 — and state legislators’ hopes that Connecticut could provide funding to continue the program have likely been dashed.
“If the federal shutdown keeps going, SNAP benefits for November will not be sent out,” Connecticut Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves wrote Tuesday in a memo to state legislators and nonprofit community action agencies.
“November federal SNAP benefits cannot be issued until the federal government shutdown ends or new guidance is provided by FNS,” Reeves added, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service.
Connecticut distributes about $75 million per month in federal SNAP benefits, with many households receiving about $190, the commissioner told the legislature’s Appropriations Committee earlier this month.
SNAP serves an estimated 360,000 people in Connecticut per year, according to state officials. But many households come on and drop off food assistance multiple times annually. The number of instances in which Connecticut residents are enrolled each year exceeds 500,000.
CT’s options to respond to SNAP freeze are limited
Reeves and Gov. Ned Lamont identified SNAP when the federal government shutdown began on Oct. 1 as a program that could quickly fall into jeopardy.
“Like many other states across the country, we are working with our federal partners to understand the full impacts of the federal government shutdown to the SNAP program for the 360,000 individuals in our state who rely on this critical federal program to feed themselves and their families,” state Department of Social Services spokesman Christine Stuart said on Wednesday. “We’ve notified our residents and community partners that November SNAP benefits will not be available until the federal government reopens. We will not let anyone go hungry because Congress can’t reach an agreement. Our hope is that Washington recognizes the real consequences this has on families in Connecticut and across the country and ends this shutdown.”
A federal program administered in cooperation with states, SNAP has a complicated funding structure. Washington and the states share administrative expenses, but the cost of benefits traditionally has been borne chiefly by the federal government. Connecticut used to offer complimentary state-funded food assistance benefits, but that ended in the late 2000s.
Shortly after the latest shutdown began, some Connecticut legislators asked if the state — which has enjoyed unprecedented budget surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion since 2017 — could again pump some of its own resources into SNAP benefits.
But with the Trump administration’s latest directive effectively shutting down EBT cards Nov. 1, that is problematic at best, said state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee.
Osten, whose panel met with state social services officials last week, added that creating a new network to distribute state-funded food assistance benefits could take up to six months.
Both Lamont and state legislative leaders have said they are exploring options to expand emergency aid to food pantries and banks and other nonprofit nutrition assistance services.
“That’s the only way we’re going to get food to people,” Osten said, adding she fears this would cover only a modest fraction of the need created by an indefinite halt to SNAP benefits. “It’s bad right now. It’s really, really bad.”

How food pantries could address growing demand
If SNAP funding dries up next month, that will put increasing pressure on local food pantries to fill the need, particularly for low-income individuals and families who rely on aid to purchase groceries.
Connecticut Foodshare has been in daily talks with state officials about how the state might step in with nutrition assistance at risk. 
The group works with more than 600 food pantries across the state as well as 110 mobile sites that are operated by Foodshare. Jason Jakubowski, the president and CEO, said about 85% of pantries in Connecticut are affiliated with them, and they provide the majority of the food to their partners, though they also source from other entities.
“At this point, we’re trying to figure out if the state is able to provide funding for local pantries who are going to see their lines double or even triple over the next couple of weeks,” Jakubowski said. “My sense is let’s see what happens next Saturday with the SNAP benefits.”
Foodshare officials are thinking about their next steps in 30-day increments. For October, the nonprofit worked on food distributions for federal employees in Connecticut who were still working and not getting paid, like TSA agents. They were able to do this with the help of $1 million in emergency funding authorized by its board of directors.
With Nov. 1 approaching, Jakubowski said the focus is on the existing network of pantries and ensuring they have enough food to meet the increased demand. But if the shutdown drags on beyond that, Jakubowski said, they’ll need to seriously consider setting up emergency food distribution sites for the month of December — similar to what they did during the pandemic.
They would need money from the state to make it happen, since a lot goes into running one. He said it would take anywhere from a week to a week and a half to ramp up such operations like food purchasing, the trucks, traffic control and the parking lots for distribution.
He estimated it would cost about $10 million to operate one emergency distribution each weekday for a month. During COVID, Foodshare launched sites in different corners of the state everyday. They were largely running them out of state and municipally owned parking lots, including the University of Connecticut’s stadium in East Hartford.
“It’s a pricey option. We do have the template because we did it five years ago,” Jakubowski said. “We’re not jumping into the deep end with this.”
State officials and local pantries are in a holding pattern as they await more guidance or the possibility of the federal government moving around money to keep SNAP afloat. But Jakubowski feels hopeful that Connecticut is much better positioned than other states if SNAP goes away in November.
“A lot of other … state governments are just shrugging their shoulders and saying, ‘hey, yeah, sorry, there’s nothing we can do.’ The conversation here in Connecticut is not ‘should we be doing anything,’ it’s ‘what can we do,'” he said.
The 600 pantries that work with Foodshare have already seen an uptick in demand, with lines resembling the peak of the pandemic at times. And that has only grown during the first few weeks of the government shutdown, which is so far the second-longest in U.S. history.
The Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, which operates food pantries at the four regional state universities and at most community college campuses, recently reported a 40% increase in demand.
A 2024 survey at Central Connecticut State University found 55% of students could not afford to eat balanced meals, and 27% of students went at least one day a week without eating because of financial challenges.
CSCU officials announced this week that the Stop & Shop grocery store chain had donated $200,000 in goods and services to support the system’s pantries.
Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven-based policy group advocating for use of more state resources to temper federal cutbacks in SNAP and other human service programs, urged state officials to seek more solutions.
“In one of the wealthiest states in the country, we have the resources to ensure that no one goes hungry,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children. “We aren’t going to food-bank our way out of this problem. We cannot logistically send a half a million people to food banks. Doing this is akin to creating bread lines at the state’s own hand. Connecticut is better than this.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_6987-6-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-22 14:16:51.953332

The Hauntings in History tour, featuring Delaware’s haunted house, appeals to both history enthusiasts and those who are curious about the supernatural.
By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Journalist Delaware Live | October 2025
Old New Castle, one of Delaware’s most historically preserved riverfront towns, is attracting visitors not only for its colonial architecture and cobblestone streets, but also for its long-standing reputation as a hub of paranormal activity. The New Castle Historical Society’s Hauntings in History tour offers a uniquely immersive experience that guides guests inside the 18th-century Amstel House. The mansion is widely regarded as one of the most haunted historic homes in the state.
“The Hauntings in History tours are unique because, in addition to ghost stories of New Castle, we also discuss the town’s darker history, like crime and punishment,” said Mike Connolly, Executive Director of the New Castle Historical Society. “Unlike traditional ghost tours, which only walk around the streets of historic cities, our tour takes guests inside the Amstel Hous,e which has been the site of reported hauntings for almost 100 years. The most well-known spirit at the Amstel House is the ‘Lady in Blue’ who has been repeatedly seen in the bedroom windows of the house and reported by passers-by.”
A Tour Rooted in Authentic History
The Amstel House was built in 1738 and stands as a testament to Delaware’s colonial past. Over the centuries, it has witnessed disease outbreaks, changes in national control, and the lives and deaths of prominent early American families. The tour highlights how these historical events lay the foundation for the ghost stories that are still told today.
Participants are guided through rooms where sightings of the mysterious Lady in Blue have been reported for generations. Guides share stories about mourning customs that once took place in the home and explain how families handled death during the 18th and 19th centuries. Outside the mansion, guests walk through the historic district and hear detailed accounts of crime, punishment, and tragedy that shaped the town’s identity.
A Unique Experience in Delaware Tourism
The Hauntings in History tour appeals to both history enthusiasts and those who are curious about the supernatural. It provides visitors with a deeper understanding of how early American life, local folklore, and documented history converge in Old New Castle. Because the tour brings guests inside an authentic historic property that has been associated with unexplained phenomena for nearly a century, it has become one of Delaware’s most distinctive fall attractions.
Visitor Information
Tours begin at the New Castle Visitor Center at The Arsenal, located at 30 Market Street in Old New Castle. Guests are encouraged to arrive early and wear comfortable walking shoes suitable for uneven sidewalks and cobblestone streets. Flashlights are optional. Tours take place rain or shine, unless extreme weather conditions arise, and tickets must be reserved in advance.
For more information or to purchase tickets, contact the New Castle Historical Society at 302-322-2794 or email info@newcastlehistory.org.
A Glimpse Into Delaware’s Haunted Past
Whether you enter as a skeptic or a believer, the Hauntings in History tour offers an opportunity to experience Delaware’s past from inside a historic home where many say history has never truly left. Between its preserved architecture, carefully researched storytelling, and persistent reports of paranormal activity, Old New Castle remains one of the most compelling destinations for anyone seeking to explore the state’s haunted heritage.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-22-134238.jpg,,,2025-10-22 14:16:51.953332

The San Francisco lawmaker’s announcement today made clear that he’s done waiting for former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to step aside, as he previously insisted he would. 
But rather than rely on his many legislative accomplishments – which span from fast-tracking housing development to policing reforms – the five-term state senator spent the majority of his launch video promising to fight back against President Donald Trump’s agenda and defend his city, which the president has threatened to target next for troop deployment.

Vance and billionaire Elon Musk. 
“I’m running for Congress to defend San Francisco – our values, our people, and the constitution of the United States – with everything I have.” 
Wiener joins a race that also includes progressive challenger Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to New York’s Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Chakrabarti has been vocal in urging Pelosi to step aside and make room for a younger generation of leaders. 
Pelosi has said she will announce her plans for 2026 after the statewide special election on Nov. 4. She was first elected to Congress in 1987 and led her party in the House from the George W. Bush administration through former President Joe Biden’s time in office.
Wiener is best known for pushing legislation in Sacramento that speeds up development of new housing by blowing holes in California’s landmark environmental laws, which housing advocates say are too often weaponized to indefinitely delay projects.
He pushed controversial legislation this year that speeds up construction of apartment buildings near public transit stops in the state’s largest metro areas, which would allow for taller buildings in single-family neighborhoods. He also authored a new law this year that bans immigration and customs enforcement agents from wearing ski masks to conceal their identities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/012325_Capitol-Session_FG_CM_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-22 14:02:26.545817

State Ports Authority, Micah Mallace is putting the state agency’s development plans under a microscope.
That includes more than $1 billion worth of expansions, terminal improvements and other initiatives to boost cargo levels at the Port of Charleston.

At stake is whether some projects might be put on the back burner or agreements reworked as the authority looks to balance wants with needs and costs.
“What we’re doing right now is an assessment of all of our capital projects,” said Mallace, who returned to the authority on Oct. 13 as its new president and CEO.
Mallace previously spent more than a decade at the authority, including as its top sales boss, before a three-year stint in the private sector.
He will give his first State of the Port speech, an annual update on port activities, on Oct. 28.
The authority “wants to make sure we’re delivering those projects in the best possible way so they are competitive and useful to our customer base, our constituencies and our stakeholders,” he told the SC Daily Gazette.
Under close scrutiny is a $690 million rail-served cargo transfer yard adjacent to the authority’s Leatherman Terminal in North Charleston, which is both behind schedule and well over budget.
State lawmakers three years ago set aside $400 million in taxpayer funds for the 118-acre rail yard, called the Navy Base Intermodal Facility, but they haven’t always felt they’ve been kept in the loop over its progress.
For example, members of an oversight committee said earlier this year they were surprised by the rail project’s rising costs and slow progress.
A reassessment is long overdue, said Sen. Larry Grooms, a Republican from Berkeley County and chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, which oversees the authority.
“I think that’s the only option the port has right now,” Grooms said, adding that for too long the authority has forged ahead with big construction plans apparently without regard for their financial success.

“They’ve got to take a look at their entire capital outlays — not just the cost of capital but the cost of labor,” Grooms said. “The other option would be to continue building it and open it at a price where no one would use it.”
The authority is forced to use unionized crane operators at both the rail yard and Leatherman Terminal — the result of a court victory by the International Longshoremen’s Association. Grooms said the more expensive labor costs have already put Leatherman at a competitive disadvantage to the port’s other terminals.
He fears the same could happen at the rail yard.
“There has to be a lot of pencil sharpening and other agreements reached in order to make the enterprise of the Leatherman Terminal make financial sense,” Grooms said, adding that the railroads also haven’t finalized agreements to use the rail yard.
“While they’re moving forward, these basic questions should have been vetted and there should have been answers before now,” he said. The rail yard needs to be completed, “but you can’t open this thing until they can get a handle on their costs and how they’re going to distribute those costs to their customers.”
After missing a July 1 completion deadline, the authority’s previous CEO announced plans to open a segment of the rail yard in January 2026. The rest of the project – known as the southern access – wouldn’t open for at least several months later.

Mallace says it makes more sense to open the entire project at one time, although he doesn’t have a specific date in mind.
A partially opened rail yard would have given CSX Corp. a competitive advantage over Norfolk Southern, the other railroad planning to use the facility, because it could use an existing line to access the site. Norfolk Southern needs the southern access, which has not yet started construction.
“The intent is to open it so it is accessible to both railroads,” Mallace said.
The railroads also don’t want to give up their own cargo transfer hubs in North Charleston — key revenue sources for both carriers.
Mallace said the authority will work with CSX and Norfolk Southern to find additional uses for their individual facilities while continuing to focus on growth at the intermodal site, which gives the port the near-dock rail it says it needs to remain competitive.
“This affords the railroads, and us, an opportunity to generate other volume at their current facilities,” he said. “We’re fortunate that there’s still a runway for a lot of growth in some commodity sectors,” adding those could give the railroads “more revenue-generating capacity” at their existing hubs once the rail yard opens.
A planned expansion of Leatherman Terminal, including a second wharf for big container ships carrying up to 16,000 cargo boxes at a time, could also be slowed.
“I don’t see how you can do phase two right now,” Grooms said. “It’s too costly to operate right now, much less doubling it. Right now, they need to get a handle on the costs and get assurances from the steamship lines they’re willing to pay them and continue to send ships to Charleston. Without that, we could end up in a downward spiral.”
The first phase of Leatherman, which opened in February 2021 at a cost of $1 billion, is the East Coast’s newest and most modern terminal but its high operating costs have steered ships to the port’s older facilities. To make it viable, Grooms said, the ILA has to make concessions “with how labor is applied and the cost of that labor.”
Ken Riley, president of the ILA’s local office, could not be reached for comment. The dockworkers’ union has taken a hardline stance on labor negotiations in the past.
Leatherman handled 75,931 cargo containers measured in 20-foot increments in the fiscal year that ended June 30. That’s about one-tenth of the terminal’s capacity. Wando Welch Terminal in Mount Pleasant, on the other hand, handled more than 1.1 million containers.
SC ports director Melvin abruptly resigns, citing ‘personal reasons’

Escalating costs and the seeming lack of a coordinated growth plan are among the reasons Barbara Melvin abruptly resigned as the authority’s president and CEO in August after three years on the job.”
“That was some criticism I’ve had for a while and now it’s all coming to a head and folks are going ‘You know, there is a problem’,” Grooms said. “It’s going to require a lot of work with a lot of the customers over how costs are going to be allocated.”
It’s a key reason why Mallace is re-evaluating the authority’s plans, with an emphasis on not rushing into anything.
“We want to do this right,” he said. “We’re assessing right now what needs to happen first, second, third … and let’s get a timeline that is conservative and realizable. I don’t want to put my name on something that’s overly optimistic. We want to deliver what we say we deliver.”
The Charleston area’s maritime community could get more insight into the port’s future when Mallace delivers his State of the Port speech. These are challenging times for the industry, with rising costs, less cargo and the future impacts of tariffs.
“We’ve got a few tough months ahead,” Mallace said, adding that the port can play an oversized role in how the local industry fares going forward.
“The maritime community, all of the vendors, the logistics companies, they depend on us to go out and make the market irrespective of what the general trade looks like,” he said. “So we’ll be talking about that at the State of the Port, that it’s our primary focus. It has to be.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wando-welch-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-10-22 14:02:26.545817

ICE arrests 105 people in southwest Idaho raid, U.S. Department of Homeland Security says

The comments come a day after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin credited ICE for the operation, where she said ICE arrested 105 people for immigration violations. The FBI previously announced five arrests of people linked to the alleged illegal horserace gambling operation in Wilder at La Catedral Arena.
“Over the weekend, ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation,” she said.
In a joint statement released Wednesday, Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Nampa Police Chief Rex Ingram said DHS’s claim that ICE led the law enforcement action “was completely false and a serious misrepresentation of the facts. It was also deeply misleading to the public.”
“The operation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Metro Violent Crime and Gang Task Force with support from multiple federal, state, and local partners,” Donahue and Ingram said in a written statement. “The Canyon County Sheriff’s Office and Caldwell Police Department, who are both longstanding members of the Metro task force, were on scene assisting with the criminal investigation. ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) were present for the identification and processing of individuals illegally present in the United States.”
The local officials said they “generally limit our comments when it comes to active federal investigations.” But they said they felt it was “important to address the confusion caused by” DHS’s recent statement.
DHS could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday. 
Advocates who were at the scene of the raid have denounced aggressive tactics they say they saw used, including law enforcement detaining everyone at the venue, children being zip-tied, and people being struck with rubber bullets.

(Photo:John Partipilo)In a defeat for Gov. Bill Lee’s administration, a three-judge panel ruled against the state’s effort to end a longstanding lawsuit challenging the vagueness and inadequacy of exceptions to Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban. 
Attorneys for the state asked for a ruling in their favor, without a trial, in a lawsuit brought by a group of Tennessee ob-gyns and women who had suffered serious medical problems during their pregnancies. The American Medical Association subsequently joined the lawsuit.
State attorneys had argued that a 2025 amendment adding “medical necessity exceptions” to Tennessee’s 2022 abortion ban made the lawsuit moot.
But the Chancery Court panel disagreed, signaling skepticism that exceptions to the state’s abortion ban were adequate to protect the lives and health of pregnant women in Tennessee.
The plaintiffs, the judges wrote, “have sufficiently alleged that the defects in the Medical Necessity Exception place their lives at risk in violation of their constitutional right to life.” 
“The changes made by the 2025 Amendment do not significantly alter the status of this case,” the panel wrote, concluding the lawsuit contained sufficiently serious and credible allegations to move forward.
Tennessee abortion ban
Tennessee’s strict abortion ban, which went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, was amended twice to provide limited exceptions for medical conditions. The law, in its original form and as amended, does not contain exceptions for victims of rape or incest, or for pregnancies with fetal abnormalities. 
In 2023, Gov. Bill Lee signed into law an amendment that said a doctor may perform one “using reasonable medical judgement, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time” if the abortion is necessary to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or to “prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”  The legislation also added molar and ectopic pregnancies as exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.  
Judges temporarily block discipline of doctors who perform emergency abortions in Tennessee

It was this 2023 legislation the lawsuit initially challenged as overly vague.
In 2024, the three-judge panel temporarily blocked the state’s medical board from disciplining doctors for providing emergency abortions but declined to block criminal prosecution of physicians, saying it lacked the authority to do so.
Their ruling also outlined four specific pregnancy-related conditions that qualify as “medical necessity” exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, noting the then “confusion and lack of consensus within the Tennessee medical community on the circumstances requiring necessary health- and life-saving abortion care.”
The four conditions include: “previable preterm premature rupture of the membranes; inevitable abortion, defined as dilation of the cervix prior to viability of the pregnancy, either by preterm labor or cervical insufficiency;” :fatal fetal diagnoses that lead to maternal health conditions, such as severe preeclampsia and mirror syndrome associated with fetal hydrops;” and “fatal fetal diagnoses leading to an infection that will result in uterine rupture or potential loss of fertility.”
This year, lawmakers further amended the state’s abortion ban to include the four conditions outlined by the chancery court ruling. The amendment says doctors “may” provide an abortion for these conditions.
The 2025 legislation also explicitly excludes mental health diagnoses as a medical exception to the state’s abortion ban. The panel’s decision, issued last week, allows the plaintiffs to challenge the lack of a mental health- related exception to the abortion ban. 
State must turn over documents
The panel in a separate decision last week allowed the plaintiffs to obtain internal documents from the Tennessee General Assembly, the governor and legislative committees that reveal the” state’s interest in enforcing the amended abortion ban and medical exceptions.” 
The panel likewise allowed for subpoenas to Tennessee Department of Health for data on abortions, maternal mortality and any unofficial guidance the department has issued to health providers since 2022.
Gov. Bill Lee signs law carving out narrow exceptions to Tennessee abortion ban

On Monday, attorneys for the state filed an emergency motion seeking permission to appeal the ruling requiring state officials to comply with the subpoenas.
State attorneys said the decision to force state officials to turn over internal documents “presents a momentous separation-of-powers  question – pitting the state judiciary against the other two branches – that should be decided by the appellate courts.”
The group filing suit is represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based law firm.
Tennessee requires three-judge panels to consider challenges to state law. Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, Judge Sandra Donaghy and Chancellor Kasey Culbreath issued the opinion in this case.

This is a relatively small amount compared to the total spent by state government and local school districts: [[...]","Seventh and eighth grade students work on algebra problems at Pioneer Ridge Middle School in Chaska, Minnesota, Sept. 24, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota school districts received nearly $1.3 billion in federal funding to support students in public K-12 schools during the 2023-2024 school year, according to a new online tracker of federal funding from the Minnesota Department of Education.
This is a relatively small amount compared to the total spent by state government and local school districts: Around 8% of Minnesota’s education funding comes from federal investments, according to an analysis of National Center for Education Statistics data by education organization Education Resource Strategies. But given rising costs and ballooning property taxes, every dollar counts.
The federal spending tracker comes amid uncertainty around federal funding from the government shutdown, fluctuating negotiations over next year’s education budget and the gutting of the U.S. Department of Education. The Trump administration has, in recent months, shrunk the federal agency responsible for sending money to school districts through mass layoffs, including almost the entire office overseeing special education. The latest layoffs will make it hard for the Department of Education to fulfill its role in funding and oversight, former employees have told national news outlets.
“Minnesotans deserve clear information about how federal investments support the students and schools in their neighborhoods,” said Commissioner Willie Jett in a release. “This tool helps families, educators, and community members see where their tax dollars go.”
Federal spending supports the state’s free meal program, special education programs, teacher professional development and services for students experiencing poverty.
The total federal funding for Minnesota is equivalent to the salaries of nearly 14,000 teachers out of the state’s 73,000 teachers.
Federal funding covered $266 million of free breakfast and lunches for students who qualify under federal guidelines, which translates to 133 million meals. The state spent an additional $267 million in the 2023-2024 school year to cover the cost of universal free meals passed in 2023.
Federal money comprises a smaller share of total education spending compared to other states and less than surrounding states — for instance, federal money makes up nearly 19% of North Dakota’s education funding — but still a significant portion of state education revenue.
Federal funding by district varies and accounts for more than 20% of districts’ total budget in 13 school districts. Those districts include small districts serving primarily Native American students, like Red Lake and Pine Point, and the state’s two large urban districts, Minneapolis and St. Paul. Federal funding accounts for less than 3% of district budgets in nine school districts, including affluent suburban districts such as Minnetonka, Edina and Orono.

Henry, The Marshall Project",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/22/no-showers-black-mold-clogged-toilets-americas-jails-disgusting/,"Courts almost universally agree that a lack of basic sanitation in jails violates detainees' constitutional rights, said David Fathi, director of the ACLU’s National Prison Project.","Poor sanitation in jails has been the subject of civil rights lawsuits for decades. Plumbing issues, vermin infestations, feces-covered walls, and limited access to basic hygiene products, such as soap or tampons, are common complaints.
Courts almost universally agree that a lack of basic sanitation violates detainees’ constitutional rights, said David Fathi, director of the ACLU’s National Prison Project. Pre-trial detainees have sued, arguing that filthy conditions violate their due process rights. If a person has already been convicted, foul living conditions could be considered cruel and unusual punishment.
Despite widespread legal challenges, many jails across the country are still filthy. Litigation against substandard conditions often ends in a settlement, Fathi noted, with officials agreeing to a change in policy, or better monitoring and enforcement, in exchange for not taking the case to trial. Settlements are typically the fastest route to clean things up, but they don’t set a legal precedent for other facilities, meaning there’s nothing requiring jails in the same county or state to adopt reforms.
Good hygiene in jail is often about more than detainees’ willingness to keep clean. Understaffing, overcrowding, facility maintenance, and mental health issues can all play a role. For example, the ACLU of Oregon, settled a lawsuit in 2019 against a county jail that had allegedly crowded a dozen women into a single intake cell, where they had to beg for toilet paper and menstrual products, and were denied showers.
“People don’t want to live in filth,” said Dr. Fred Rottnek, director of community medicine at St. Louis University and former medical lead at the St. Louis County Jail. “They are at the mercy of the administration to provide needed services because they can’t do it on their own.”
Reporters from The Marshall Project’s local news teams dug into the state of sanitation at jails in St. Louis; Cleveland, Ohio; and Hinds County, Mississippi, home to Jackson, the state capital. They found that poor jail maintenance and management, as well as understaffing, means many detainees are left to live in unsanitary conditions.

St. Louis City, Missouri
On most days, Marvin Young is desperate for a shower. For over a year, he’s been detained at the St. Louis City Justice Center awaiting trial on an attempted robbery charge.
“I haven’t had a shower in three to four weeks,” he said in June from the jail’s visiting room, pulling at the stains on his jail-issued T-shirt. Even through the glass, the odor was unmistakable.
Detainees are supposed to have shower access at least three times a week, according to jail policy, which was last updated in 2020. (The city did not respond to multiple requests for confirmation that staff still adhere to these policies). In the past, detainees have accused jail staff of withholding water access to punish people for speaking out about their conditions or asking questions. Jail policy says correctional officers can also force people to shower in certain circumstances. According to Young, however, people are desperate for the chance to rinse off.
“We gotta take bird baths in our cell,” he said, describing how he tries to cover the small opening in his cell door for privacy before attempting to clean himself over the sink. “I try to keep my spirits up, my health up… [but] I’ve been so mad, my knuckles are black from punching the walls.”
Current staffing levels mean there aren’t always enough officers to supervise people during recreation time — the hour that detainees get outside their cell for showers, phone calls, and stretching their legs — or to check and see if cells are clean. The jail, which houses roughly 800 detainees, is currently down about 50 correctional officers, according to jail commissioner Nate Hayward.
Hayward, who started at the jail in September after more than three decades at the county jail, said his goal is to hire 40 correctional officers by January, as well as two additional maintenance workers to address clogging in the showers and other facility needs.
The city’s former jail commissioner, Doug Burris, told The Marshall Project in April that roughly half of the pods in the jail were on a 23-hour lockdown. People formerly incarcerated at the jail described being held for days at a time in cells with feces on the walls. Their only reprieve was the hour they could spend in the dayroom — when there was enough staff to supervise it.
To make matters worse, detainees rarely have enough hygiene supplies, said Khanika Harper, a member of the city’s Detention Facilities Oversight Board.
The jail is supposed to give each detainee a personal hygiene kit with a toothbrush, soap, and deodorant when they first enter the jail. Once they run out, they have to purchase replacements through the commissary, or apply for free items through a caseworker if they can’t afford the commissary. Certain items, such as underwear, can only be replaced for free after a caseworker has physically inspected the old ones, according to jail policy.
Harper said she’s heard multiple reports of people not receiving soap, deodorant, or cleaning supplies for their cell and common areas, leading to a buildup of dirt and bacteria on people and surfaces alike. The showers have cockroaches and feeble water pressure, she added. Men wash their clothes in the sink when they can’t get clean laundry. Women on their periods are supposed to receive free pads and tampons from caseworkers, but Harper said detainees told her those supplies don’t always make it to women in time.
“If they have mercy on you, they’ll get it to you when they get it to you,” she said.
Hayward, however, is optimistic that some of the strategies he implemented at the county jail could also work in the city. For example, on days when the county jail was too short-staffed for detainees to get out for recreation hour, he instructed shift captains to let people out for the few minutes they needed to take a shower.
“If they don’t get out all day,” he said, “we gotta at least give them a shower.”
Cuyahoga County, Ohio
The Cuyahoga County Jail doesn’t have enough showers. The jail has been cited by the Ohio Bureau of Adult Detention year after year for not meeting the state’s standard of one shower for every dozen beds.
From June 2024 to June 2025, there were 334 work orders placed for malfunctioning or unusable showers, with complaints ranging from clogged drains and no water, to black mold in the shower with a leaking ceiling, according to records obtained by The Marshall Project.
Even if the jail cleared the backlog, it would still fall short of its requirement because some of its cells are holding two people, which exceeds the state’s ratio, Jennifer Ciaccia, press secretary for the Cuyahoga County Department of Communications, wrote in an email. Aging infrastructure exacerbates the strain on the jail’s plumbing system, Ciaccia added, leading to “frequent malfunctions.”
Detainees — some of whom can spend months awaiting trial — are responsible for cleaning the showers and other parts of the facility. But there is no set cleaning schedule, Ciaccia noted. Corrections officers are tasked with ensuring that the housing units are cleaned daily, and that showers are powerwashed “regularly.” Officers are required to provide residents with cleaning supplies, including solutions, mops, brooms, scrub pads, and toilet brushes.
Despite the mandate, detainees consistently complain of filthy conditions, including scratches and dirt on surfaces, disgusting sinks, and toilets caked in body fluids and grime. Staying clean is hard, they said, because the water pressure is so weak you can’t wash your hands. One detainee said he had to use the same spoon for every meal, cleaning it in the sink attached to his toilet.
In August, Tianetta Carter spent several days in jail after being arrested for a domestic violence charge. She refused to shower, she said, because the stalls were filthy. The toilets were so dirty, she asked for menstrual pads from a corrections officer so she could clean them first. Every time she went to the bathroom, she said she had to ask a corrections officer for toilet paper, and she was held in a cell where the toilet was backed up for hours.
“No matter how much they clean it, it’s still bad,” she said. “It’s so bad.”

Hinds County, Mississippi
When court-appointed monitors walked through Hinds County’s Raymond Detention Center in 2022, they found a myriad of deplorable conditions: broken toilets and showers, empty cells used as dumpsters, mice, and people sleeping on floors in general areas, with no access to toilets. One thing particularly troubled a monitor about the cleanliness of a housing unit: Two men had been found covered in feces.
Three years later — even though the dumpster cells have been cleaned up and the most problematic housing unit is closed — monitors said the jail is getting worse.
“Overall, the Hinds County jail system has regressed over the past two-and-a-half years,” monitor David Parrish said in an August court hearing.
People detained there described vile conditions: smells of sewage, limited access to showers, toilets and laundry facilities.
The jail’s sanitation problem is just one symptom of larger operational failures, said Kathryn Bryan, who was the jail’s administrator in 2021. It is a reflection of the jail’s many other issues: overcrowding, understaffing, gang control and crumbling infrastructure. The jail has a well-documented history of negligence. In October, a court-appointed federal receiver took control to manage the jail’s budget and day-to-day operations.
Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones declined to comment on the conditions, citing pending litigation and the incoming receivership.
“There’s nothing clean about that place,” said Tedrick Francois, who spent two weeks in jail this summer, after being arrested for allegedly attempting to deposit the same checks more than once. He was first held for hours in a dark holding cell with about 20 others. He remembers a broken toilet overflowing and spilling human waste onto the floor. His housing unit had one functioning shower, the monitoring report found.
Reports by court-appointed monitors say the jail is severely understaffed, with 71 corrections officers, about one-third of the number necessary to operate the facility. In the gaps, incarcerated people take control. “Pod bosses” control the distribution of food, hygiene products, and in some cases, who gets a cell, the monitors found.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A “catastrophic” loss of funding is little over a week away for Head Start centers serving 2,500 children across Oklahoma.
If the nationwide government shutdown continues, four Head Start programs in Oklahoma will run out of federal funding on Nov. 1, threatening the closure of dozens of child care centers primarily serving low-income families in rural areas. These four Head Start programs, including centers operated by the Cherokee Nation and Choctaw Nation, reach the end of their fiscal year on Oct. 31.
“It’s a very dire situation right now, and the longer it goes on, the harder it’s going to be on our people that are greatest in need,” said Curtiss Mays, president of the Oklahoma Head Start Directors Association.
The Cherokee Nation has contingency plans in place if the shutdown continues, Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin, Jr. said in a statement. 
The vast majority of the $12.9 million budget for Cherokee early childhood services in 2024-25 came from federal funds, the tribal nation reported. The Cherokee Nation enrolls 680 children ages 3-5 in its Head Start programs and another 200 in Early Head Start, which serves infants and children up to age 3.

Hoskin said federal funds for food assistance and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program also are immediate concerns during the shutdown.
“While we stand ready to do our part, implementing such plans comes at a real cost to the Cherokee Nation, one that should never fall on tribes fulfilling the federal government’s Treaty and Trust responsibilities,” he said. “We do hope both sides of the aisle work on a path forward and reopen the government as soon as possible and call on the administration to honor the government’s Treaty and Trust responsibilities, avoid needless cuts to Tribal programs and personnel, and use its authorities to minimize harm to tribes and tribal citizens.”
The Choctaw Nation did not return a request for comment. Its tribal government operates 14 Head Start centers in rural cities across its reservation in southeast Oklahoma. In 2022-23, Choctaw Head Start centers served 337 children, according to an annual report.
Along with the two tribal nations, two nonprofits that operate several child care centers in rural Oklahoma also face a loss of funding on Nov. 1, Mays said.
Community Action Resource and Development runs 11 Head Start and Early Head Start locations in Washington, Wagoner, Rogers and Mays counties and in Broken Arrow.  
United Community Action Program serves 783 children from birth to age 5. It operates 15 Head Start and two Early Head Start centers in eight counties across northeast and northern Oklahoma.
The program director for United did not return a request for comment. Oklahoma Voice was unable to reach Community Action Resource and Development.
Mays said the closure of a Head Start center would cause cascading harm to its surrounding community. Parents might have to stay home from school or work, costing household income and straining local businesses, and children would lose the opportunity to continue their early education, he said.

The federal Head Start program has served more than 30 million children across the country since its founding in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
In 2024, it provided $196 million to support child care centers, health screenings, meals and family services for 14,846 Oklahoma children. Most families who qualify live in poverty.
Some Oklahoma Head Start providers receive their federal funds earlier in the year and therefore aren’t impacted by the government shutdown. For example, the Community Action Agency of Oklahoma and Canadian Counties, where Mays is the Head Start program director, starts its federal fiscal year on April 1.
Head Start programs must return unused federal dollars at the end of their fiscal year, which limits their cash reserves, Mays said. The centers facing a funding cliff on Nov. 1 might have a small runway to continue operating, he said, “but it wouldn’t be a very long one.”
“We’d be able to make it maybe about a week or two, and then we would have to look at shutting down or closing down sites at least temporarily,” Mays said. “That’s a pretty catastrophic result for any program both in the short and long term.”
The National Head Start Association warned 134 programs serving 58,627 children across 41 states and Puerto Rico would lose federal funding if the shutdown continues to Nov. 1. 
Six programs outside of Oklahoma already have lost funding because their fiscal year began Oct. 1, the first day of the shutdown, according to the association. 
The organization urged Congress and President Donald Trump to end the shutdown immediately and reach an agreement on a fiscal year 2026 appropriations bill to fund the federal government.
“Head Start isn’t just an education program — it’s a promise of stability,” executive director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. “When parents go to work or school, they do so knowing their children are safe, learning, and cared for. That sense of stability is priceless, and it’s exactly what’s now at risk.”

,DC,2025-10-22 17:25:50+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Shutdown likely to halt food benefits for 42 million in just days,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/shutdown-likely-halt-food-benefits-42-million-just-days,,"WASHINGTON — More than 42 million low-income Americans are at risk of losing food assistance Nov. 1 if the government shutdown continues.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has about $6 billion in a multi-year contingency fund. That’s short of the roughly $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means benefits would likely be delayed.The shortfall is caused by the shutdown, which hit its 22nd day Wednesday. The fund is supposed to maintain a balance of about $9 billion, but $3 billion of the funds expired at the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30. Because Congress has not approved the next year’s funding, the fund only has $6 billion.USDA would have to come up with the remaining $3 billion. The department could try something similar to its shuffle of more than $300 million in tariff revenue into its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, through the rest of the month. It’s unclear if USDA plans to use the SNAP contingency fund or any other maneuvers to extend benefits.Nearly 40% of the 42 million SNAP recipients nationwide are children 17 and younger, according to the USDA. About 20% are seniors aged 60 and older and the remaining 40% are adults aged 18 to 59.USDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment from States Newsroom.Parties in Congress remained nowhere near a deal to end the shutdown as of Wednesday.States scramblingA Democratic congressional staffer familiar with the SNAP program said that even if Congress passes a stopgap before Nov. 1, the month’s benefits will still be delayed because it takes time to process the benefits and there are limited vendor processors.The program issues electronic benefits on a card that can be used like cash to purchase food. States will upload either all or part of a month’s benefits on the first day of the month.Even in states that say they have enough funds to extend SNAP through November, such as North Dakota, state officials have said they are unable to load the funds on the cards. Kansas officials said once Congress passes a stopgap, the state can distribute benefits to the state’s 188,000 SNAP recipients within 72 hours, meaning any deal would have to be completed by next week to avoid an interruption of services. Other states, including Minnesota, have halted new enrollments in SNAP. Wisconsin’s Gov. Tony Evers warned that 700,000 residents are at risk of losing their SNAP benefits. Tennessee officials have informed SNAP recipients — nearly 700,000 people — that it received notice from USDA that SNAP funding will cease entirely on Nov. 1 if the government shutdown doesn’t end.Unheeded warningsUSDA on Oct. 10  warned states to hold off on sending SNAP files to electronic benefit transfer vendors due to the government shutdown“Considering the operational issues and constraints that exist in automated systems, and in the interest of preserving maximum flexibility, we are forced to direct States to hold their November issuance files and delay transmission to State EBT vendors until further notice,” SNAP acting Associate Administrator Ronald Ward wrote. “This includes on-going SNAP benefits and daily files,” Ward continued. Last week, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that SNAP will run out of funds by the end of the month if Congress fails to strike a deal and end the government shutdown.",,,,2025-10-22 14:02:26.545817

The NNSA confirmed 152 New Mexico employees charged with overseeing national laboratories’ nuclear weapons work were furloughed on Oct. 20, 2025. (Courtesy of NNSA)The federal government this week sent home more than 150 federal New Mexico employees charged with overseeing national laboratories’ nuclear weapons work, with only 14 employees across two sites remaining at work, the National Nuclear Security Agency confirmed to Source NM.
The furloughs include 71 employees at NNSA’s Los Alamos field office and 81 at the Sandia National Laboratories location, NNSA Deputy Director of Communications Laynee Buckels told Source NM in an email. Seven employees remain at each site, working without pay, she said.
The field offices are responsible for “ensuring compliance with federal contracts to manage and operate the national security assets,” according to the NNSA website.
Buckels did not respond to follow-up inquiries about the job descriptions for the employees who remain working.
The New Mexico furloughs come as a part of a larger hit to the agency, announced earlier this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. During a news conference in Nevada on Monday, Wright confirmed that 1,400 employees across the nation had been furloughed as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1.
“We did everything we could to keep our federal workers here employed as long as possible,” Wright said during the news conference. “But unfortunately, today is the day our ability to deploy funds to pay those workers ended.”
The furloughs are the agency’s first since its creation in 2000, as none occurred during previous shutdowns.
The NNSA, charged with overseeing and maintaining the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile and development, also oversees the transportation of nuclear weapons and materials.
Wright said on Monday that NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation, which trucks nuclear weapons and materials within the U.S., had enough funding to operate until Oct. 27.
Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) called the furloughing of NNSA workers a “manufactured crisis” in a statement to Source NM.
“President Trump did not have to furlough 80% of the workers who maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile — he chose to. Just like he chose to fire workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration earlier this year and cancel billions of dollars in clean energy projects that lower Americans’ energy bills. President Trump is simultaneously risking our national security and actively tanking our economy,” Heinrich said. “Republicans control the White House, the Senate, and the House, but they refuse to come to the table and work with Democrats to lower skyrocketing costs and health care premiums. This is Trump’s manufactured crisis. It’s time Republicans get serious, come to the negotiating table, and work with Democrats to lower costs and protect working families’ livelihoods.”
The NNSA outsources the management of the national laboratories to private contractors, meaning that the labs themselves may not see furloughs for at least another month.
A spokesperson for Los Alamos National Laboratory told Source via an emailed statement last week that LANL “has funds in place to continue operations. We focus on maintaining the safety and security of our employees and facilities.”
Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, told Source NM in an interview Monday that Sandia Labs officials confirmed “they have enough operational funds to get through November,” in a meeting with her staff after the announcement about furloughs.
Unlike federal employees, contractors will not receive back pay for work during furloughs. Earlier this week, Senate Democrats, including New Mexico’s Sens. Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján introduced legislation to allow for contractors to collect lost wages and benefits.
