Jim Pillen for his signature to transform them into state laws. If you’re keeping score at home (Pro tip: You should be.), that’s nearly six times more than the U.S. Congress has sent along to the president to become federal law as of this writing. 
And one of those was a simple continuing resolution, which meant Washington pols couldn’t agree on how to fund the government, so they did some can-kicking down the road towards a place called Do Nothing Congressville. 
Federal lawmakers would do well to emulate the Unicameral’s 2025 output. That said, the measures that landed on Pillen’s desk — despite earning enough votes to arrive there — surely came with a variety of opinions about either their efficacy or their expedience. Some good. Some not so. A couple stinkers.
What they’re doing
Obviously, the governor could veto any of them. Suffice to say, however, that the ideas and principles contained within those 31 were something enough state senators liked.
A drone’s eye view of the proceedings reveal what you might expect: We’re against smut, illicit drugs and thieves, and we’re for interruption-free school days and lowering property taxes.
Some were even legislative slam dunks, passing 49-0. Still others were big vote getters such as LB 383, which requires you to be at least 18 to establish a social media account and prohibits the use of AI to generate pornographic images of minors. We’re also about to codify what many school districts already do: ban cell phones in public schools during the day, and to just say no to sales of lab-grown meat, making sure our cheeseburgers have parents other than petri dishes.
Among the senators’ handiwork was a dead aim at assorted crooks and ne’er do wells who use ATM and gas pump skimmers and their felonious brothers and sisters in the business of shoplifting for profit: stealing and then reselling or fencing the pilfered goods. One bill, LB 230, regulates the sale of tianeptine, known as “gas station heroin,” sold as a dietary supplement but which can be dangerous, even deadly. 
A two-year budget closed a looming deficit for now, and some property tax relief may be on the way, but some other high profile subjects were left in committee or on the legislative chamber floor for lack of votes. Such is a representative form of government.
Devil in details
Senators also found a number of devils in the details of trying to mitigate the will of Nebraska voters by tweaking the minimum wage law, which voters approved at the ballot box. Playing footsie with ways to diminish the wishes of voters never plays well in the Legislature, despite new and creative ways to dress up the idea.
Even LB 89, among the session’s most contentious proposals, the “Stand With Women Act” has — thankfully —moved away from policing bathrooms and locker areas to address only the “fairness” issue through a gender lens in high school and college athletics. That alone is one of modern society’s stickiest wickets, so getting off the toilet and locker snide was a reasonable step for legislators.
Nevertheless, to my knowledge, during the entire discussion and debate of LB 89, little if any evidence was provided that men were regularly using women’s bathrooms in Nebraska … or anyplace else for that matter. While I’ve read of no particularly solid, universal solution to the transgender athletes and competitive sports conundrum, the incessant attention the Legislature has paid to this issue — not uncommon among state legislatures — can work against those in the transgender community as they feel put upon and devalued. 
Finding legislation that addresses these issues without such side effects would be a real legislative triumph. Thinking it can be done is a start.
Finally, if we really want to stand with women, we should do so comprehensively. To their credit, lawmakers did just that when they voted 49-0 for LB 78, which gives housing support to survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking. 
Protecting young women from unfairness on the playing fields or intruders in their private spaces may be one thing, but in a state where, according to the World Population Review, over a third of Nebraska women have experienced domestic abuse, including intimate partner violence, standing with women should include working to reduce that number, too.
The Legislature will still add to the pile on the governor’s desk. To the state’s Congressional delegation and the other 430 elected to do the people’s business: Take note.

State regulators oversee Georgia Power rate cases. John McCosh/Georgia Power (file)Monday is the last day to register to vote in the June 17 primary to fill two Georgia Public Service Commission seats on an embattled board that has faced criticism for a series of Georgia Power rate hikes over the last several years.
Winners of the upcoming primaries will face off in November to determine who will serve on the five-member charged with regulating a number of  telecommunications, electricity and natural gas services across the state. The winners will serve on a board that has approved six utility rate increases since 2023 for Georgia Power customers.
This year’s primary and general elections will mark the first time since 2020 PSC contests have appeared on Georgia ballots following lawsuits challenging redistricting and the fairness of the PSC election process for Black voters. Typically, the terms of the five commission districts are staggered over a six-year period.
The 2025 PSC early voting period for the primary election will be held from May 27 to June 13.
If no candidate receives 50% of the vote in the June 17 election, a runoff election will be held on July 15.
Georgians can find information about registering to vote and more about elections on the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.
Currently, Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are facing challengers seeking to upset their bids to remain on the board. The other three members of the board are also Republicans.
Echols, who is seeking his third term on the PSC, will face challenger Lee Muns in the Republican primary for the commission’s District 2 seat. Whoever wins will go on to face Alicia Johnson of Savannah, the sole candidate for the Democratic Party.
Although the commissioners must reside in the geographical district that they represent, every Georgia voter can determine the winner since the state regulators are elected statewide.
There is a large field of candidates for the metro and suburban Atlanta area represented by Johnson, who is seeking re-election after being appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp to fill a vacancy in 2021.
One of the Democratic candidates is Daniel Blackman, who served as a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden, and went to a run-off against incumbent Lauren “Bubba” McDonald in the 2020 Public Service Commission election.
The District 3 Democratic primary also includes Keisha Waites, a former member of the Atlanta City Council and the Georgia House of Representatives, as well as Peter Hubbard, founder of Center for Energy Solutions who has been an expert witness at PSC hearings, and Robert Jones, who has had a career involved in energy regulation in California.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday that a residency challenge has been filed against Blackman after he moved into the PSC district one day before the deadline for candidates.
Since the start of 2023, the average Georgia Power residential customer is paying about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, recover excess fuel expenses, and cover the cost of completing two nuclear power generators at the Plant Vogtle expansion.
The Southern Company subsidiary serves about 2.7 million customers and is the state’s largest supplier of electricity.
Georgia Power’s 2025 resource plan details the company’s ambitious energy deployment goals for the next decade, including accelerated plans to add both fossil fuel and clean energy sources.
Georgia Power projects that over the next decade the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption. The proliferation of data centers has become a source of consternation for a number of consumer and environmental watchdogs.
There has been some optimism among Republican members of the PSC that the new federal administration under President Donald Trump will curb inflation and stabilize some of the high electricity bills Georgians pay. Additionally, they stated that they supported efforts to increase solar production and usage in the state.
Georgia isn’t the only state with customers frustrated about rising utility costs. Consumer education nonprofit PowerLines and the polling company Ipsos conducted a nationwide survey in March that revealed 73% of 2,000 respondents were concerned about rising energy prices.
“The results held consistent across the political spectrum, with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike expressing similar levels of concern,” the report said.
However, 90% of respondents could not identify the name of the state regulator that oversees gas and electric bills.

Free.,"Conservatives on U.S. House Budget Committee switch votes, advance GOP package",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/conservatives-us-house-budget-committee-switch-votes-advance-gop-package,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on the Budget Committee moved the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill a step closer to the chamber floor in a rare Sunday night vote after a handful of conservatives blocked the bill Friday. The massive deal squeaked through on a 17-16 vote, with four far-right panel members voting “present.” They were Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas. All four voted no on the bill Friday.Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania flipped his Friday vote of “no” to support the massive budget reconciliation deal that cuts safety net programs to pay for extending, and expanding, President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law — at a cost of $3.8 trillion over the next decade.Smucker, the panel’s vice chair, switched his vote Friday because of committee procedural rules that allowed him to propose reconsideration of the measure.Brecheen, Clyde, Norman and Roy voted “no” on Friday after demanding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients begin prior to the bill’s stated date of 2029, and that clean energy tax credits phase out at a faster pace.Roy wrote on social media Sunday night that he changed his vote “out of respect for the Republican Conference and the President to move the bill forward” but that the bill “does not yet meet the moment.”Other details on why the members changed their votes to “present” were unclear. When asked by Democrats on the panel whether anything had changed in the bill, Budget Committee Chair Jody Arrington said negotiations were “fluid.”“Deliberations continue at this very moment. They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House,” said Arrington of Texas.Ranking Member Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said his side of the aisle wanted “transparency.”“If the bill has changed and there's been some side agreement reached, I think it's important that all the members have the full details on that in advance of any vote,” Boyle said.Massive billThe committee’s tense Sunday night meeting began nearly 30 minutes late.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters on Capitol Hill shortly beforehand that talks were going “great” and that “minor modifications” had been made over the weekend.The 1,116-page bill package that includes bills from 11 separate committees will now need to clear the House Committee on Rules to advance to a full House vote. House members are set to leave for Memorial Day recess on Thursday.As written, the bill cuts more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals as well as those with disabilities.Credit downgradeSunday night’s vote came just two days after Moody’s Ratings downgraded the U.S. government’s credit rating, citing a gloomy outlook for U.S. debt and interest burdens.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” a Friday statement from the investment rating service read. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”The reconciliation package could add up to $3.3 trillion to the national debt through 2034, reaching $5.2 trillion if temporary provisions are made permanent, according to analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet released scores for all parts of the megabill.The far-right House Freedom Caucus board released a statement shortly after Sunday night’s vote, saying the bill continues to increase deficits “with possible savings years down the road that may never materialize.”“Thanks to discussions over the weekend, the bill will be closer to the budget resolution framework we agreed upon in the House in April, but it fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget,” according to the statement posted on social media.Members of the caucus who do not serve on the Budget Committee made similar public statements.“America faces the reality of financial insolvency and looming bankruptcy. For 9 years, I have remained faithful to principles that include an end to the continuous growth of FedGov deficit spending. I will not support a federal budget that increases federal deficit spending,” GOP Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana wrote on his X profile Sunday.Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee wrote on the social media site, “The Moody’s downgrade is yet another wake up call. We need to decrease spending immediately!”Thin marginsAs expected, and following Friday’s same result, Democrats on the panel voted unanimously against the package.Republicans hold a slim 220-213 margin in the House, meaning that if more than three Republicans vote with Democrats — who are all expected to vote against the package — the bill would fail on the floor.Republicans swiftly voted down several last-ditch efforts by Democrats on the panel to protect low-income health care and food assistance programs, as well as clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.Johnson must also contend with a parallel — and expensive — fight among his conference on the state and local taxes, or SALT, deduction. Republicans who represent high-income, high-tax blue states like California and New York, are demanding a more generous cap on the amount they can deduct.",,,,2025-05-19 01:01:07.420342

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Pennsylvania voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the 2025 primary election. 
In the first election since Donald Trump won back the White House, Democratic voters across Pennsylvania are selecting who they want to be their mayoral candidates in several of the state’s biggest cities. 
After suffering significant defeats in 2024, which included losing a U.S. Senate seat, all three statewide row offices and two congressional districts, the primary races may indicate which direction the Democratic Party will be taking over the next few years.
Most of the state’s largest cities have contested primary elections, with the exception of York, an outlier in this cycle, with only one candidate being on the ballot for mayor. Since most of these cities are Democratic strongholds, the winner of the primary election will likely have an easy path to victory in November. (In Pennsylvania’s closed primary system, only registered Democrats and Republicans can vote in their party’s primaries.)  
Here are a few cities where voters will select nominees for mayor on Tuesday. 
Pittsburgh’s primary 
Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey made history four years ago by defeating incumbent Bill Peduto – becoming the city’s first Black mayor and the first challenger to defeat a sitting mayor since 1933.
Now, he is trying to avoid becoming the second incumbent mayor in a row to lose a re-election bid. 
Gainey faces a strong challenge from Allegheny County Controller Corey O’Connor in tomorrow’s Democratic primary, which will likely determine the next mayor in the heavily blue city. (Pittsburgh hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1934).

O’Connor, a former city councilman and the son of former Mayor Bob O’Connor, has out-raised Gainey, received big support from developers and has been endorsed by the city’s trade unions. He has drawn some heat for accepting support from mega-donors to Donald Trump. 
In ads, O’Connor has targeted Gainey over blight and crime. He’s also gone after the police chief’s sudden decision to retire after public controversy because he was working part-time on the side as NCAA basketball referee. 
“Our city needs stable, dedicated leadership, not revolving door appointments or part-time commitments,” O’Connor told WESA last month. “I will ensure we have a chief who is focused on rebuilding trust, strengthening Pittsburgh’s public safety and delivering real results for our community.”
O’Connor did not respond to requests for comment. 
Gainey supporters have shot back that homicides and nonfatal shootings have dropped due to Gainey’s use of more community-based violence prevention programs. Several prominent African-American groups have accused O’Connor and his allies of using “racist tactics” by focusing heavily on crime in his attacks against the Black mayor. The city is about 22% Black.
They’ve also sparred over development, with O’Connor saying Gainey has slowed housing growth in the city. O’Connor disagrees with Gainey’s push for citywide “inclusionary zoning,” which creates affordable housing requirements for developments in the city, in favor of a more neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach.

Noting developers have supported O’Connor by a margin of 4-to-1, Gainey said attacks on his zoning initiatives are yet another sign that O’Connor is the candidate of the developers. 
“For decades, the rich and developers have ruled things in this city and now with Corey O’Connor, they want to take back that power because I am trying to help poor people,” Gainey told the Capital-Star. 
The conflict between Israel and Palestine has also played a role in the race. In August, Gainey’s communication director, Maria Montaño, resigned after blowback stemming from her signature on a petition calling on the city to avoid firms with ties to Israel. 
Gainey also apologized for “mistakes” in a statement he signed onto on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas that was criticized as “victim blaming” by the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh. 
“We have asked time and time again for (Gainey) to be our ally and to stand up for us — and unfortunately, we have been met with great disappointment,” Jeremy Kazzaz, executive director of the local Beacon Coalition, a pro-Israel Jewish advocacy group, told Jewish Insider earlier this year. 
Allentown
Voters in the state’s third largest city will also cast their ballots to determine if their incumbent mayor will serve a second term. 
Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk and Allentown City Councilmember Ed Zucal are both vying for the Democratic Party nomination. 
Tuerk, seeking a second term, made history in 2021 when he became the first Latino mayor in the city’s history. He writes on his campaign website that he “will continue to bring a fresh voice to City Hall, maintaining a focus on the power of partnerships and building coalitions, not tearing it down and trying to build it back up.”
“Our government will continue to be run effectively and efficiently, serving all of Allentown’s residents and reflecting the incredible diversity of the city,” the site says. 
Zucal, a two-term city council member, says on his campaign website that he’s “tired of seeing our residents get ignored.” 
“It’s time to get back to basics, put residents first, and deliver results for the people of Allentown,” he said. 
Tuerk has a fundraising advantage over Zucal, according to Armchair Lehigh Valley. The incumbent has raised $50,970 from January through May 5, while Zucal raised $21,279 in that same time period. Tuerk’s campaign had $32,981 on hand at the end of the filing period on April 30, while Zucal’s campaign had $31,022.
In 2021, Tuerk, a longtime economic development official, unseated incumbent Mayor Ray O’Connell in the Democratic Party primary by a narrow margin in the six-candidate race for the nomination. He cruised to victory in the general election over Republican Tim Ramos.
Depending on Tuesday’s outcome, it may not be the only time Tuerk and Zucal face off this year. No Republicans have filed to run for mayor, although Zucal is also actively seeking Republican write-in votes, which may pit the two candidates against each other in the general election.

Erie
Erie Mayor Joe Schember, who is seeking a third and final term, is facing two challengers in the Democratic primary.
“Despite the pandemic, despite the societal issues, and despite the financial challenges facing the city, my administration has made significant progress in positioning Erie for a more prosperous future,” Schember writes on his campaign website. “I remain committed to my mission: build opportunity, restore hope, transform Erie. In my first six-plus years, I have remained open, honest, transparent, and accessible, and that will continue as long as I am mayor.”
Daria Devlin, an Erie School Board member, and Sheila Woeger, a retired teacher, are also both hoping to lead the northwest Pennsylvania city. 
Devlin said in a campaign video that it’s “time for change” in Erie.  
“For too long, we’ve been sleeping on our potential as a city, and the time to act is now,” Devlin said. “Working families can’t wait four more years to find affordable housing. Can’t wait for jobs to come back. Can’t wait for the safe streets our kids deserve.”
Woeger told Erie News-Now that her top priority is to “look at the books and go over the budget line-by-line to see how the money is being spent and that it’s going to the appropriate places,” adding she also wants to meet with city employees one-on-one to see what Erie can do better.
According to Erie News-Now, the race is believed to be the first time two mayoral candidates in Erie have raised more than $200,000. Schember raised $203,841 from Jan. 1 to May 5, while Devlin’s campaign has raised $217,840 since launching her candidacy last year.
The Erie County Democratic Party endorsed Devlin over Schember and Woeger.
During his successful 2021 campaign, Schember cruised to victory over Democratic challengers Tom Spagel and Sydney Zimmerman. In 2017, he was first elected to the office after winning a crowded seven candidate race for the Democratic Party nomination. 
The Erie-Times News notes that the winner of the Democratic Party primary will be a “huge favorite” given the party’s registration advantage and that no Republican has been elected mayor since 1961. 
The winner of the Democratic primary will likely face Republican Matthew Thomas, an attorney and sole GOP candidate, in the general election. 
Scranton
The race to lead the Electric City includes several candidates, although just two are featured in the Democratic Party primary: incumbent Mayor Paige Cognetti and Robert Sheridan, a former Scranton School Board member. 
Cognetti is seeking her second full term in office. She was first elected to the office as an independent in 2019 in a seven-candidate special election to fill the seat previously held by Mayor Bill Courtwright, who was sentenced to prison on public corruption charges.
She ran as a Democrat in 2021 and coasted to victory in the primary election over Scranton City Controller John Murray. Cognetti went on to defeat Republican Darwin Lee Shaw II in the general election. 
Prior to winning a school board seat in 2009, Sheridan ran for multiple offices in the past, including the Republican nomination for mayor in 2001, although he lost in the primary election. Sheridan is also the Scranton Democratic Party chairman.
Former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a lifelong Scranton resident, has backed Cognetti’s campaign.
Patricia Beynon, an accounting executive, and Lynn Labrosky, a business owner, are vying for the Republican Party nomination, while Scranton Councilman Gene Barrett is running as an independent.
Bethlehem
William Reynolds, seeking a second term in office, is going up against city Councilwoman Grace Crampsie Smith in the Democratic Party mayoral primary. 
According to Armchair Lehigh Valley, the incumbent has the fundraising edge. Reynolds had $123,379 in total funds from Feb. 1 to May 5, while Crampsie Smith’s campaign had $73,945. Armchair Lehigh Valley has also reported the two “have often clashed on city issues, especially when it comes to creating more affordable housing.”
In 2021, Reynolds, then a Bethlehem City Councilman, won the Democratic party nomination for mayor over former city administrative employee Dana Grubb and later won the general election. In that same year, Crampsie Smith was the top vote getter for the four open seats on Bethlehem City Council, per Armchair Lehigh Valley.
No Republicans have filed for the race, meaning the winner of the Democratic Party primary will likely be elected to the office for the next four years. 
Lancaster
The race for mayor of Lancaster is one of the contests that is an open race after Mayor Danene Sorace announced in July 2024 that she would not seek a third term. 
City Council Vice President Jaime Arroyo and Councilwoman Janet Diaz are seeking the Democratic Party nod, while no Republican challengers have filed for the race.
Arroyo has been endorsed by the Lancaster City Democratic Committee, the Pennsylvania Working Families Party, and Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania PAC, and several local elected officials, including Sorace. Diaz’s campaign website lists endorsements from two Philadelphia City Council members, plus an attorney and a cardiologist in Lancaster.
Harrisburg
The state’s capital also features an incumbent Democrat running for a second term. Wanda Williams, then Harrisburg City Council president, won the Democratic Party nomination in 2021 over incumbent Mayor Eric Papenfuse.
On Tuesday, Williams is facing Harrisburg’s City Treasurer Dan Miller, Harrisburg City Councilman Lamont Jones and community activists Lewis Butts Jr. and Tone Cook Jr. 
PennLive reports that Miller is significantly outraising and outspending the rest of the field. 
There are no Republican candidates that have filed for the primary election. 
  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (via Krasner campaign)
What about Philly?
Cherelle Parker made history in 2023 when she was elected to become Philadelphia’s 100th mayor and the first woman to hold the position. Although Parker isn’t up for reelection until 2027, the state’s largest city will be voting on a few citywide races on Tuesday, including district attorney.
Democratic primary voters will decide between incumbent Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner and former Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Pat Dugan.
Krasner is seeking a third term and has been endorsed by the Working Families Party, Our Revolution, a progressive political organization, U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-2nd District), and several other Philadelphia lawmakers aligned with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. 
Dugan, who is more moderate, has been largely backed by influential building trades labor unions, as well as multiple elected officials, mostly representing Northeast Philadelphia.

For the second election in a row, the Philadelphia Democratic Party decided to not issue an endorsement in the district attorney race, which the Philadelphia Inquirer described as a “snub” for Krasner. Instead, the party is leaving it up to the individual ward leaders to determine who they want to support in their respective wards. 
Both candidates have raised more than most of the mayoral primary candidates across the state, although Dugan has outpaced Krasner since he declared his candidacy. WHYY reports that between November 2024 and May 2025, Dugan raised about $900,700, while Krasner’s campaign raised more than $499,900 during the same time period.
In 2021, Krasner coasted in the Democratic primary, securing a roughly 30 point victory over challenger Carlos Vega. He won by more than 40 points in the general election over Republican candidate Chuck Peruto, to formally secure a second term. 
Running as the progressive outsider, Krasner was first elected in 2017 after winning a seven candidate primary and later defeating Republican Beth Grossman in the general election.
No Republican candidates have filed to run for district attorney. 
While Tuesday’s primary election will likely be decisive, Republicans have started a write-in campaign to nominate Dugan for the general election despite his commitment to not run as a Republican.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 04:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,What fighting antisemitism means to Donald Trump,Robert Helfand,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/what-fighting-antisemitism-means-to-donald-trump/,Trump found “very fine people” among the marchers at Charlottesville who chanted “Jews will not replace us.”,"The Trump Administration says it’s “combating anti-semitism” when it arrests students and threatens universities.
 That rationale might be a flimsy pretext, as opponents claim, but it also reflects something subtle and more dangerous. Trump is stealthily narrowing the definition of “antisemitism,” aligning it with ideas that undermine the position of Jewish Americans.
Trump’s administration does not, after all, condemn all ideologies that vilify Jews.  The “Great Replacement Theory” inspired the murders at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue and elsewhere, yet Trump found “very fine people” among the marchers at Charlottesville who chanted “Jews will not replace us.” JD Vance also sees plots to “replace” the white electorate, and Robert Kennedy, Jr., claimed COVID was “ethnically targeted to attack Caucasians” but spare Ashkenazim.
Nor does Trump oppose every form of religious discrimination.  The creator of the “Muslim Ban” served dinner to Nick Fuentes, who draws a hard line between Judaism and “Western civilization,” and he’s invited “proud Islamophobe” Laura Loomer to the White House.
Where Trump has been consistent is in supporting Jewish territorial claims in Israel/Palestine. In his first term, he overturned a decades-old policy declaring West Bank settlements illegal, and he proposed the immediate annexation of large portions of Palestinian territory. He now questions why Israel “gave” Gaza to its residents,[18] and he appointed an ambassador who believes “Abraham and his heirs” hold “the title deed” to the West Bank.
Supporting these policies is not the same as accepting Jews.  The American Jewish Committee says Germany’s Alternativ für Deutschland party has “a clear record of antisemitism.”  Yet AfD’s support for Israel is “unmatched by any other German … party.” Among other goals, that position serves to sanitize AfD’s Christian nationalism.  Its deputy chair connects Israel’s “efforts to preserve its unique culture and traditions” with her own opposition to multiculturalism in Europe, arguing, “The same should be possible for Germany and any other nation.”  AfD’s co-founder asserts, “When we stand with Israel, we are also defending our way of life.”
Trump’s team promotes AfD because he, too, believes our essential identities derive from connections to homogeneous “nations.” By “nation,” he means a privileged subset of the inhabitants of a political territory: as Vance explained at the Republican convention, a “nation” is not a country or an idea, but “a group of people with a shared history.” That’s why Trump opposes birthright citizenship, and why he can casually propose expelling two million Gazans from the place they were born. For Trump, people naturally belong only where their “nation” resides.
This form of nationalism finds the meaning of Judaism in the political movement for a homeland in the Middle East—as when Trump’s Congressional allies declare that anti-Zionism simply “is” antisemitism. But it exposes Jewish Americans to the same threats we face from more conventional Jew-hatred. It allows Trump to tell us Israel is “your country,” and Benjamin Netanyahu is “your prime minister,” making our status in the U.S. a matter of tolerance, not true belonging.
Worse still, Trump makes that tolerance contingent on adherence to his beliefs. If we don’t support the actions of Jewish nationalists abroad, he says, we can’t be truly Jewish, either.  After Democratic politicians first expressed concerns about Netanyahu’s tactics in Gaza, Trump fumed: “Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion … and they should be ashamed of themselves.”  More recently, Trump said of Sen. Chuck Schumer, “He’s not Jewish anymore.  He’s a Palestinian.”
Linking Jewishness to real estate makes Trump see Palestinians as the antithesis of Jews.  In his eyes, a Jew who fails to share that outlook becomes the monster of traditional antisemitic lore: something perverted from its essential nature.
In these ways, Trump’s politicized definition tells a story about “antisemitism” in which most Jewish Americans (the large majority who support the Democratic Party) are the villains —alien perpetrators of “hate” against the Jewish faith.  
This same upside-down logic is now being used to portray the suppression of campus speech as a blow against religious persecution.   Nobody should fall for it.

Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, as they discuss a budget amendment with aide Pete Ecklund, right, on Sunday, May 18, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)This year’s Permanent Fund dividend will be $1,000, according to a final draft state budget approved Sunday afternoon by six House and Senate negotiators.
The dividend was among the biggest items in a $5.9 billion document that will fund state services from July 1 this year through June 30 next year. 
The draft approved Sunday is scheduled for a final vote as soon as Tuesday in the House and Senate and will advance after that to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who may reduce or eliminate individual line items. He may not increase a line item.
The Legislature’s regular session reaches its constitutional limit on Wednesday.
The latest forecast from the Alaska Department of Revenue expects significantly lower oil and gas revenue over the next year, and lawmakers significantly cut services and programs during the budget drafting process. 
Unlike in previous years, the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend was not a contentious issue for budget negotiators at the end of the legislative session.
Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said on Sunday that lawmakers had already argued the issue earlier in the session, and even though she unsuccessfully voted for a $1,400 dividend on Sunday, she knew the $1,000 figure would be final.
“From my perspective, I already knew what this number was going to be,” she said.
Compressing the dividend is the state’s precarious budget situation. 
In December, Dunleavy handed lawmakers a budget draft with a $2.1 billion deficit and a $3,900 dividend; the budget will leave the Capitol with a surplus of about $55 million. Legislators expect that surplus will evaporate in the coming months — oil prices are running below the Department of Revenue forecast, and Republican members of Congress are planning to reduce the amount the federal government pays for major programs, including food stamps and disaster relief.
The Senate approved a budget draft with deeper cuts than the final document, but during the compromise process, lawmakers added individual line items preferred by the House, which proposed higher levels of spending and a draw from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s main savings account, to pay for that spending.
The final version of the budget eliminates that draw from savings, except as needed to cover a deficit remaining in the current fiscal year. 
If lawmakers don’t approve the CBR draw, money would be taken from the state investment bank — better known as the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, or AIDEA — and the state’s education trust fund. 
That will put pressure on members of the House’s 19-person Republican minority caucus, who previously voted against drawing from the CBR. Thirty votes are needed in the 40-person House to spend from the CBR.
The final version of the budget includes an additional $13.7 million for child care programs, $5.7 million more for infant early learning programs and 15 new full-time positions to help process public assistance applications. 
The conference committee, in charge of negotiating the compromise budget, also approved a House proposal to increase funding for behavioral health services used by mentally ill homeless people by $13.75 million.
“The Alaska Behavioral Health Association made a strong case that they need that,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and chair of the conference committee.
In future years, the state will try to obtain behavioral health funding through federal Medicaid grants.
A $1 million grant to food banks — proposed by the House — was rejected in the final version of the budget, as was funding for public radio.
There will be no new troopers for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough; the committee voted 4-2 to eliminate a section of the House budget that would have re-established the trooper post in Talkeetna. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, and Johnson voted in favor of the addition.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and a vote against the addition, said that the reopened trooper post was suggested by Gov. Mike Dunleavy who withdrew that proposal — and all of his other proposed budget increases — before the conference committee met.
Johnson said the failure to include the troopers, who could be used to curtail the Railbelt drug trade, was “probably one of the bigger disappointments for me in there.”
The final version of the budget also eliminates a paragraph that sought to restrict gender dysphoria treatment, the kind used by transgender Alaskans. That paragraph was inserted by the House in its budget draft, but the Senate didn’t include it.
Conversely, a paragraph limiting abortion care, adopted by the Senate but rejected by the House, was included in the final budget draft. 
That paragraph has been repeatedly challenged in court, and the effect of including it in the budget is a small cut to Medicaid funding. 
Josephson said the result of the two decisions is a return to the status quo — the Legislature has included the anti-abortion language in its budget for years, and the anti-transgender language was new this year.

Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Public Information Services.The House and Senate were able to pass several non-controversial bills on the second-to-last day of the legislative session, but lawmakers continued negotiating behind closed doors on major budget bills to fund human services, education, transportation and more. Education alone comprises roughly 40% of the general fund budget.
Democratic and Republican legislative leaders hope they can finish their work with a one-day special session before Memorial Day, but that depends on quickly hammering out the most contentious parts of a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that their respective caucuses can support.
That won’t be easy, given the dynamics of a 67-67 House and 34-33 Democratic-Farmer-Labor majority in the Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said on TPT Almanac on Friday that this has been the most difficult session of the 18 she’s been through in the Legislature.
Still unresolved is whether the state will roll back access to subsidized health insurance for undocumented adults and cut funding to private schools, both of which have staunch advocates and opponents.
Lawmakers must pass a budget by June 30, or the government shuts down. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they’re in a special session.
While lawmakers and staff scrambled behind the scenes Sunday afternoon, lobbyists turned the television outside the Senate chambers to the pro golf championship to pass the time until more bills came to the floor.
The House and Senate both passed the judiciary policy and budget bill (HF2432), which in addition to funding law enforcement and the courts, approves closing the Stillwater correctional facility over four years. Walz and legislative leaders announced Thursday that they agreed to close the more than century-old prison, which came as a surprise to other lawmakers, who nevertheless have broadly supported the decision.
Rep. Josiah Hill, DFL-Stillwater, said the prison looks worse than the one in “The Shawshank Redemption.” He said it has to be closed, but in the least disruptive way for the prison’s more than 550 full-time workers and 1,200 inmates.
“We need to make sure we get this process right,” Hill said on the House floor on Sunday.
Union leaders representing correctional officers blasted the decision to close the facility, saying it was made without their input.
The Senate also approved a House bill (HF1143) by a wide margin that cancels $77.2 million in funding for a passenger rail line between Minneapolis and Duluth to help school districts pay for unemployment benefits for bus drivers, paraprofessionals and other hourly school workers.
The Northern Lights Express, a longtime dream of Duluth residents and transit enthusiasts, is dependent on winning federal grants to cover the majority of the cost. That funding seems unlikely to materialize under the Trump administration while it pursues drastic cuts that will further strain the state’s tight budget.
The bill didn’t cancel all the funding for the rail project, and Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, said she’s holding out hope that it will happen one day.
“Although we are making a substantial cancellation because of this austerity that is being imposed upon the people of Minnesota … the Northern Lights Express project is still alive,” McEwen said on the Senate floor.
The bill, which passed the House on Friday and is expected to be signed by the governor, would give school districts $100 million for unemployment insurance for hourly school workers.
Republicans have pushed to end the entitlement, which was passed in 2023 under Democratic control. School districts have complained the benefits make it harder to recruit staff to work part-time summer jobs, and that the mandate will take away critical resources for classrooms.
The state has been funding the cost so far, having appropriated $135 million in 2023. There’s about $33 million left in the account, only about half of what’s expected to be needed this summer.
The Senate also passed a bill (SF2884) with bipartisan support that increases pension benefits for public employees, including school teachers, firefighters and state patrol officers. If it becomes law, teachers would be eligible to retire at 60 years old with lower early retirement penalties if they have 30 years of service. State patrol retirees will receive a permanent 1.25% annual increase in their benefits to help keep up with the cost of inflation. The police and fire plan also gets a one-time 3% boost. The bill must still pass the House.
The House and Senate have also passed a bill funding housing and homelessness prevention (SF2298) as well as agriculture, broadband and rural development (HF2446).",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrE9lzpWQAAKeSW-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-18 21:59:05.381793

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit and its engineers have reached an agreement to end a three-day strike that entirely stopped rail service on the nation’s busiest commuter rail line, officials announced Sunday.
The deal, which must still be ratified by the union’s members and NJ Transit’s board, comes after a seven-year bargaining standoff that included years of mediation, interventions by two presidential emergency boards, and the first strike to hit the agency in more than 40 years. NJ Transit said service will resume Tuesday.
Details of the tenative agreement remain unknown. Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman at NJ Transit, said it would boost hourly pay for train engineers. Gov. Phil Murphy called the deal “fair and fiscally responsible.”
Though negotiators reached a tentative deal in March that offered wage hikes in line with those accepted by NJ Transit’s 14 other unions, rank-and-file members of the NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen overwhelmingly rejected that agreement.
Engineers argued wage differentials with counterparts at other rail agencies and the lengthy training process for their workers — it takes NJ Transit 20 months to train a locomotive engineer — justified larger wage increases.
Officials at NJ Transit resisted, worrying larger increases would trigger provisions to guarantee similar raises in other unions’ contracts, ballooning the cost of the engineers’ proposal into the hundreds of millions of dollars, costs NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri warned would bankrupt the agency.
In the hours ahead of the Friday’s strike deadline, union negotiators offered concessions on work rules and health benefits that would produce savings for the agency and allow larger raises for engineers without triggering increases for other NJ Transit workers, Haas said Friday.
The impact of the strike on New Jersey’s economy was not immediately clear. NJ Transit’s rail service carries roughly 350,000 riders daily, Kolluri has said, and the agency’s contingency plan for a work stoppage could only handle roughly 20% of that volume, and that at a cost of about $4 million per day.
Negotiations spilled into public acrimony with accusations of bad faith negotiation and mental health issues earlier in May, but the two sides appeared to moderate their tone in the final days before the strike.

 The union has been working under an expired contract since 2019.

Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.”“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” President Donald Trump wrote on social media. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who was the party’s vice presidential candidate after Biden dropped out of the race and  Harris took his place at the top of the ticket, said on X that Biden was “a truly decent man and a friend.”“Gwen and I are praying for President Biden and his family,” he wrote.“I am saddened to hear of President Biden’s cancer diagnosis and am wishing him and his family well as he begins treatment,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins wrote on X.Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor who served as Biden’s Transportation secretary after running against Biden, Harris and others in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, said Biden “is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience.”“Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing,” Buttigieg wrote on X.“Joe has been a fighter his whole life. He will prevail. Sending Dr. Jill Biden and their family my absolute support,” Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania posted on X.“This is very sad news. Praying for his recovery,” GOP Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said on X. “We are rooting for President Biden in this fight!” former Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz wrote, reposting Luna’s post.Age a factor in presidential raceBiden’s doctors said he was fit and healthy enough to be president after evaluations in February, 2024.“President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” Dr. Kevin C. O’Connor wrote.But by that summer, Biden’s deteriorating state  — though not connected to the diagnosis disclosed Sunday — would force him out of his reelection bid.Biden dropped out of the race for the presidency on July 21, 2024, creating an unprecedented vacancy atop the Democratic ticket one month before he was scheduled to officially accept his party’s nomination. He endorsed Harris to take his place as the Democratic nominee, and she was nominated by Democrats but lost the election to Trump.Biden’s withdrawal came after a weeks-long pressure campaign from party insiders following a disastrous June 27, 2024, debate performance against GOP candidate Trump and rising criticism that he could not mount a winning campaign against the man he had defeated in 2020. Biden appeared frail and confused at several points during the debate, leading to worries he was no longer up to the task of governing.After leaving the White House on Jan. 20, Biden kept a low profile and did not make public remarks until April 15, when he criticized the current administration for cutting thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration and rebutted those who have questioned the program’s relevance.“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon,” Biden said. “They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees — 7,000 — out the door in that time, including the most seasoned career officials.”Book publicationIn more recent days, the publication of a book by two political reporters, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, sparked controversy by its claims that those in Biden’s inner circle worked to keep his cognitive decline from public view.Titled “Original Sin,” the book — based on interviews with what the authors said were more than 200 people, mostly Democratic insiders —  included new details about the presidency, such as Biden apparently failing to recognize movie star George Clooney at a fundraiser in June 2024 in Los Angeles. Biden’s decline was such in 2023 and 2024 that use of a wheelchair was discussed, if he was reelected, the book reported.Just Friday, the White House released audio of an interview of Biden by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Hur who issued a lengthy report concluding that while President Joe Biden “willfully retained” classified materials following his time as vice president, he would not be charged with a crime.Hur wrote in the 388-page February 2024 report that prosecutors considered “that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-18 19:01:09.912353

The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.



The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

Standing out to JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike is the slow march toward gaining communitywide buy-in to build up the Malcolm X memorial birth site and nonprofit foundation she now heads. Burned into her mind is a moment 15 years ago when she thought: “Where’s the people? Where are the people who are going to move this thing forward?”
But they and other fans said they’ve seen increased recognition and understanding in their state of what Malcolm X stood for. Buoyed by his rising national prominence, local voices have championed Malcolm X’s journey as one of self-determination, personal reformation and quest to unify Black people — and have successfully advocated for ways to enshrine his name in the state where he was born.
Efforts intensified as the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birthday approached — and is being observed Monday, May 19.
“There’s a shift of the tide,” McKinney said, for the Black empowerment advocate he says is often misunderstood. “People are actually honoring his legacy and respecting it. It’s a show of understanding of who he was and what he means to North Omaha, the city and the world.”
Racial antagonism abandoned
Born Malcolm Little, his family left Omaha after suffering harassment from white supremacists, before Malcolm X was two years old. He evolved from a street hustler who, while in prison, became self-educated and converted to the Nation of Islam. He took the new surname “X” to signify the unknown African surname of his ancestors.
After completing a pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm X had a new outlook that abandoned concepts of racial antagonism. He changed his name again and denounced the Nation of Islam, which led to death threats.
At 39 years old, as he was about to give a speech in New York City in 1965, the father of six daughters was shot multiple times at close range by three gunmen identified as members of the Nation of Islam.

McKinney, a lawmaker who represents the North Omaha area where Malcolm X first lived, reflected on the Little family that he said was a target of racism. Malcolm’s father, a minister, was active in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which led to the family’s being harassed. McKinney said the Littles would not have fathomed the recent turn of events in Nebraska.
Shifts
Consider these milestones:
In May 2024, the state inducted Malcolm X as the 27th person and first African American into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame. Some along the way thought he was too controversial for the hall the Legislature created in 1961 to recognize Nebraskans who have made significant contributions to the state and nation.
Indeed, it took three different nominations over nearly two decades, in 2004, 2007 and 2022, before he was selected in 2022 by a governor-appointed commission who considered public testimony. The formal induction came two years later, with a bronze bust in Malcolm X’s image installed in the State Capitol. Due to legislation passed in 1998, no more than one person can be added to the Hall of Fame every five years.


Malcolm X, 100 years celebration

	
Various activities, including a block party and youth poetry contest, helped mark the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birth date.
Bus tour “pilgrimages,” which come with an admission cost, will continue through June 1 to view the slain civil rights leader’s bust in the State Capitol — “the very institution that once ignored him,” says the marketing material. Included are presentations, held in partnership with the Black Studies Department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, to deepen understanding of his legacy and relevance today.
Also part of the celebration is a May 30 free public screening of “Divisible,” a documentary film focusing on the history and current impacts of redlining in Omaha. The show starts at 7 p.m.
A May 31 Legacy Gala at the Durham Museum has an admission cost.

At the induction, former State Sen. Ernie Chambers quipped about what he saw as a near impossibility: “I never thought in my wildest dream that I would live long enough … to see a white conservative Republican governor in a white ultraconservative state like Nebraska participate in the induction of Malcolm X.”
Also in 2024, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law establishing a “recognition” of Malcolm X every year on his birthday. McKinney had pushed for a state holiday, but that measure stalled. He said financial barriers to designating a paid holiday prompted him to change direction. He called the alternative a “good first step.”
The legislation calls for each May 19, starting this year, to be “set apart for holding suitable exercises in the schools of the state in recognition of the sacrifices of the late Nebraska Hall of Fame inductee El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, Malcolm X and his contributions to the betterment of society.” El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name Malcolm adopted after completing the “Hajj” pilgrimage to Mecca and converting to Sunni Islam.
Museum on the horizon
Also in 2024, the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation officially was awarded a $20 million grant from the state to create a museum devoted to its namesake near 35th and Evans Street, a site where Malcolm X first lived with his family. The funds followed through on legislation, approved the previous year, to build the cultural center supporters foresee as a tourist destination.
Originally, the foundation had requested funding through a competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The museum was not among recommendations by a consultant, however. Amended legislation led by State Sens. Justin Wayne and McKinney carved out funds for the project.
As planned, the public dollars are set to build the museum, which is an anchor of a broader vision to transform the 17-acre campus that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home.

Construction has yet to launch, but LeFlore-Ejike says planning is “moving along” with a review ongoing of requests that have been submitted for the master site plan development.
LeFlore-Ejike became executive director of the foundation in 2022, taking over work initiated in 1971 by Rowena Moore.
She said efforts to transform the still largely undeveloped area, which has gardens and a visitors center, has had “ebbs and flows.”
LeFlore-Ejike recalled the moment in 2010. She was a volunteer still in school, and the foundation had a grant for “visioning” work after having just purchased the current visitor’s center, which was the former home of a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation. She recalled disappointment in the lackluster support to continue building momentum.
Now, she said, “We’re finally in a season of harvest.”
Citing LeFlore-Ejike’s work with the foundation, USA Today named her a nominee for its Women of the Year program in 2025. The selection recognizes “heroines” across the country who break barriers, push for change and make communities better.
LeFlore-Ejike hopes Malcolm X supporters are proud that decades of volunteer work “has not been in vain.”
History-making

Malcolm X’s 100th birthday observance comes as Ewing also celebrates a historical win in Nebraska’s largest city. In last Tuesday’s election, he soundly defeated three-term Mayor Jean Stothert.
“It all goes to show how far we’ve come as a community when it comes to being inclusive and accepting of leaders in our community,” he said.
Ewing said leaders “come in all shapes and sizes and backgrounds.”
“It’s important they are accepted and know they belong here in Omaha and in Nebraska.”

Until last month, Nick Panicola was working at two environmental nonprofits in northern Michigan.
His jobs at SEEDS Ecology & Education Centers and Crosshatch Center for Art & Ecology ranged from organizing educational events to community composting. That included developing “a food recycling network in the area, which we just launched a few weeks ago.” He held the positions through AmeriCorps.
Then came a stop work order from the Michigan Community Service Commission at the end of April.
AmeriCorps provides paid community service jobs that span a wide range of fields, from disaster recovery to education, generally through temporary, low-paying positions.
In April, the agency placed most of its staff on leave.
The Trump administration also ended around $400 million dollars in funding for AmeriCorps grants. That was a big chunk of the program’s roughly billion-dollar budget, which effectively ended over 32,000 positions.
And almost instantly, those cuts were felt in communities across the country.
In Michigan, more than $15 million in funding was cancelled. That means nearly 700 people across dozens of organizations won’t receive the rest of their stipends, education awards and other benefits, according to the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, or LEO.
The state was expecting a National Civilian Community Corps team to assist with ice storm recovery. But that program was terminated.
Grants were canceled for MI Healthy Climate Corps, an AmeriCorps program that funded positions — like Panicola’s — at local governments and other organizations to further the state’s climate goals.
In northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, the program provided staff members to several organizations, including the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities, the Marquette County Planning Division, and Northern Michigan University.
At the state’s Office of Rural Prosperity, a Climate Corps member worked with rural communities to take advantage of revenue from renewable energy, among other duties, according to Erica Quealy, LEO’s deputy communications director.
In an email to IPR, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote that “Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch.”
The AmeriCorps Office of Inspector General’s 2024 audit found that independent auditors found multiple issues but that the agency “took appropriate actions” to address some of the recommendations from the previous year. AmeriCorps didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday afternoon.
The agency has also reported that its environmental programs pay for themselves many times over, with high returns on investment.
At the end of April, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined other states in a lawsuit challenging the cuts as unlawful. A group of community organizations and grant recipients from across the country filed a separate lawsuit earlier this month.
The White House did not address IPR’s questions about how AmeriCorps work should be completed moving forward or the legality of the cuts.
Applications for the third cohort of MI Healthy Climate Corps members were still open on the website of the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, as of Thursday afternoon.
In an email, EGLE spokesperson Jeff Johnston wrote that the initiative supports Michigan’s leading clean energy job growth, “which currently accounts for over 127,000 jobs and is expanding rapidly,” along with areas like public transit and waste reduction.
Johnston said the department was “disappointed” in the Trump administration’s cuts, adding that the department hopes there will be an outcome that allows the program to continue.
In the meantime, those who were told to stop work are waiting — with little information about what’s next and bills to pay.
“I think we all have to figure out how we’re going to make that work in this time period,” said Panicola, who was in the midst of his term with SEEDS and Crosshatch. “And I think for a lot of us, that might just be in exiting the program and finding a full time job, hopefully within the same framework of what we cared about and what we were doing before.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-17-064610-1024x755.png,,,2025-05-18 14:03:14.729390

Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of shares of Trump Media the same day that President Donald Trump unveiled bruising new tariffs that caused the stock market to plummet, according to records obtained Wednesday by ProPublica.
Trump Media, which runs the social media platform Truth Social, fell 13% in the following days, before rebounding.
Trump’s “Liberation Day” press conference from the White House Rose Garden unveiling the tariffs came after the market closed on April 2. Bondi’s disclosure forms showing her Trump Media sales say the transactions were made on April 2 but do not disclose whether they occurred before or after the market closed.

Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned through work could violate the law. But cases against government officials are legally challenging, and in recent years judges have largely narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading.
It’s unclear from the public record whether Bondi as attorney general would have known in advance any nonpublic details about the tariffs Trump was announcing that day. Trump, of course, publicly announced his plans to institute dramatic tariffs during the election campaign. But during the first weeks of his term, the market seemed to assume his campaign promises were bluster.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions about the trades.
The disclosure forms do not include the specific amount of stocks sold or their worth but instead provide a rough range. The documents do not say exactly what time she sold the shares or at what price. The company’s stock price closed on April 2 at $18.76 and opened the next morning, after the press conference, at $17.92 before falling more in the days ahead. In addition to selling between $1 million and $5 million worth of Trump Media shares, Bondi’s disclosure form shows she also sold between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of warrants in Trump Media, which typically give a holder the right to purchase the shares.
Bondi’s ownership of Trump Media shares has previously been disclosed. Before she became attorney general, Bondi was a consultant for Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that merged with Trump Media to take the president’s social media company public.
As part of her ethics agreement, Bondi had pledged to sell her stake of Trump Media within 90 days of her confirmation, a deadline that would have allowed her until early May to sell the shares.
On April 1, Trump Media filed a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission with details about holdings of various top shareholders, including Trump and Bondi. The purpose of the filing is unclear, as is whether it relates to Bondi’s sales the next day. It appeared to reregister for sale shares held by several of the company’s top shareholders.

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)Emily Pike’s mother found out that her 14-year-old daughter had been murdered when she saw photos of garbage bags containing human remains posted on social media.
Police didn’t call Stephanie Dosela; she called them after viewing the photos that had been leaked from the Gila County Sheriff’s Department. Emily, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, had been missing for 18 days after running away from a group home in Mesa.
“A mother should not find out on social media about her daughter’s dismembered body,” Dosela said in a written statement to Arizona state legislators on May 14.
The unthinkable way that Dosela said she found out about her daughter’s murder is emblematic of the poor communication and failures of the individual pieces of the tribal, county and state systems — first, to keep Emily safe, and then to find her after she went missing.

During a Joint Legislative Oversight Committee hearing on May 14, Arizona lawmakers heard from law enforcement officials, leaders of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, Emily’s family and the Arizona Department of Child Safety about the failures of the system and ways to prevent what happened to Emily from happening again. Police, legislators and Emily’s family members alike could be seen quietly sobbing at various points during the nearly three-hour-long hearing.
Emily went missing from the Mesa group home on Jan. 27. Her remains were found near Globe, just outside of the reservation where her family lives, on Feb. 14.
But the systemic deficiencies that led her to disable the alarm on her bedroom window and to run away from the Mesa group home date back years.
In 2023, a 911 call was made from a remote area of the San Carlos reservation near Emily’s home, to report that she had been sexually assaulted. But instead of a San Carlos Apache police officer trained in dealing with sexual assaults, the tribe’s fish and game department responded.
San Carlos Apache Police Chief Elliot Sneezy couldn’t tell legislators specifically why fish and game responded instead of one of his officers, but said that fish and game are the experts in finding people in extremely rural areas of the reservation and that police were “busy” that day.
At that time, Sneezy said, there were only 22 police officers on staff to cover the entire 1.8 million acre reservation.
The family member who Emily accused of assaulting her was arrested, but was soon released without being charged. Emily, meanwhile, was taken into the custody of San Carlos Apache social services for her own safety and sent to the Mesa group home.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs previously told the Arizona Republic that it dropped the sexual assault case due to insufficient evidence, but other agencies disputed that claim.
“My niece was a victim, but yet she was punished and removed from her home,” Emily’s uncle, Allred Pike Jr., told legislators. “That’s how justice failed her. The person that she accused of hurting her got to go home. How is that justice? It’s just backwards.”
Terry Ross, director of tribal social services, told the committee that it’s often difficult to prosecute such cases when family members decide to protect the accused.
“What I experience with our tribe is that all the families will support the perpetrator, and we can’t do anything but to remove the child (for their safety),” Ross said.
After tribal social services removed Emily from her home and sent her to Mesa, more than 100 miles away, she attempted suicide and ran away multiple times.
She was placed in a residential mental health treatment facility for more than a year before being released back to the Mesa group home.
In a statement read by family spokesperson Gail Pechuli, Dosela said that Emily experienced culture shock when she was taken from her rural home near the tiny town of Peridot and placed in Mesa, a city of more than 500,000 people in the Phoenix metropolitan area.
“My Emily was far from home, she was alone and homesick,” Dosela said, adding that she told her grandmother that she missed home-cooked traditional foods like acorn soup and tortillas.

Emily lived on the reservation with her mother and other family members. Her father is currently in prison for an arson-related conviction. In her statement, Dosela said that she suffers from addiction issues and lives in poverty, but said she believed Emily was safe in the group home where she was sent.
Sen. Carine Werner, co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on the Department of Child Safety, said that the group home was not given background information on why Emily was there, something that she said was vital to her caregivers’ understanding of her behavior.
While Emily was living in a facility that is licensed by DCS when she went missing, she was not in the department’s custody — she was in the custody of the tribe, which contracts with the group home for placements. The San Carlos tribe has only one tiny group home on the reservation and must place children in other locations when it’s full.
Because Emily was in the custody of the tribe — a sovereign nation — certain reporting requirements outlined in Arizona law when a child in DCS custody goes missing didn’t apply to her.
Kathryn Ptak, director of the Arizona Department of Child Safety, explained that an amended state law signed last year in response to a surge in runaways from DCS group homes didn’t pertain to Emily because she wasn’t in the DCS system.
The law requires family, friends and the school of the missing child to be contacted within 24 hours of their disappearance to obtain any information about where they might be. It also stipulates that the child’s family and tribe must be contacted by phone and in writing to inform them that the child is missing.
Therein lies one of the major issues identified by numerous people who spoke to the committee: Tribal sovereignty means that the state generally doesn’t have the power to pass laws that control tribes.
DCS has memorandums of understanding with four of Arizona’s tribes, but not currently with San Carlos Apache.
“When a child is living on tribal land and either eligible for enrollment or enrolled in a tribe, the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction,” Ptak said. “The state can’t come in and tell them what to do with their children.”
She added that, because Emily was never in DCS custody, the department didn’t have access to information necessary to contact her family and friends.
Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Democrat from Coal Mine Mesa and a member of the Navajo Nation, argued that, no matter their race or tribal affiliation, all missing children should be treated the same.
“Emily Pike was born in the state of Arizona, resided in Arizona all of her life, regardless of what tribe she’s a member of,” Hatathlie said.
The senator added that DCS should not just sit by and refuse to help because of jurisdictional issues.
The group home reported Emily missing to police on Jan. 27, and the tribe was informed the next day. But her tribal case worker did not immediately consider her disappearance an emergency, San Carlos Attorney General Alex Ritchie explained, since she had run away and returned several times before.
San Carlos Apache Social Services didn’t inform Emily’s family that she was missing until she’d been gone for a week.
After Emily’s body was found, the San Carlos Apache tribe called for an investigation into group home licensing, and also agreed to investigate how her sexual assault report was handled.
Several of the speakers on May 14, including Ritchie, recommended that every child who goes missing from a group home be immediately considered missing instead of labeled as a “runaway.”

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)
“Our recommendation is that every child, the moment they’re not accounted for, they are missing,” Ritchie said. “That way the level of scrutiny is heightened. Of course, there will be folks who don’t agree with that, but these are children. They are the most defenseless and the most in need of folks looking out for them.”
But because teens will regularly run away from group homes for the weekend, only to show back up the following Monday, Ptak recommended that reporting requirements be loosened so that group homes wouldn’t be required to report a child missing if they’re told they can’t go somewhere and they leave anyway, especially if caretakers know where they’re headed.
Nearly all of the speakers agreed that better communication between all the entities involved was vital to any attempts to prevent another tragedy like Emily’s death from happening in the future.
Suggestions included better sharing of background information about children in their custody between tribal social services and group homes, that group homes have pertinent information ready to provide to police when they report a child missing and that the tribes enter into agreements with DCS for information sharing about children in the group homes that they license.
Emily’s mother asked that the Gila County Sheriff’s Office look into how it handles the sharing of sensitive information on social media, and that the San Carlos Apache Tribe open a larger group home, with better mental health services, on the reservation.
Sneezy told legislators that group homes that house Native children should be better informed about their cultures, and that law enforcement entities should work on better communication, especially since local law enforcement doesn’t have jurisdiction on tribal land.
“What I’ve heard today is the failure of agencies, our departments, our jurisdictional issues, federal, state, tribal,” Allred Pike said. “We need to stop working in silos. We need to start sharing information. We need to start working together so this won’t happen again.”
The committee plans to host multiple stakeholder meetings in the coming months to figure out workable solutions, with plans to recommend changes in law during the next legislative session in 2026.
“This jurisdictional thing sounds easy but I know it’s not, but I commit, and I’m sure the whole legislature commits to finding solutions to make sure that this never happens again,” said Sen. Hildy Angius, R-Bullhead City.
The Gila County Sheriff’s Office, along with the San Carlos Apache Tribal Police Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI are collaborating in the ongoing investigation into Emily’s murder.
Earlier this week, Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a new law that would create a Turquoise Alert, a new kind of alert that can be issued by the Department of Public Safety when a Native person goes missing. The legislation was introduced before Emily went missing but was renamed “Emily’s Law” after her body was found.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota has about half the number of syphilis cases this year as it did at the same time last year, and about a third as many as the same time in 2022, when the outbreak peaked and the state reported the highest rate in the country.
About 160 cases were reported by the end of last month, according to the state Department of Health. Although that’s an improvement compared to the past few years, the number remains high compared to cases before 2020.
Syphilis is a bacterial infection most often spread through sex that can be cured, but can cause serious health problems without treatment and can be spread from mothers to unborn babies.
How the state, tribes and federal government are working to curb SD’s syphilis epidemic

Syphilis was close to being eradicated in the United States in the 1990s, but cases in South Dakota were increasing in the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Syphilis infections nationwide climbed rapidly in recent years, reaching a 70-year high in 2022, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A majority of cases in South Dakota are among Native Americans. While the highest number of cases so far this year is in Pennington County, where Rapid City is located, the highest rates are in counties that include tribal lands, such as Buffalo, Dewey and Oglala Lakota counties.
There was a time not too many years ago when there were hardly any reported cases, said Meghan Curry O’Connell, chief public health officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board in Rapid City.
“We still have lots of work to do,” she said.
Tribal and state entities have partnered in the last few years to address the situation. Some tribal health care systems send nurses to find and treat patients in the Rapid City area and on reservations. The state Department of Health launched its Wellness on Wheels program last year as well. The program provides a mobile health care unit for rural communities, including STI testing, treatment, education, counseling and referrals to community resources.
Curry O’Connell said the work has had an impact on syphilis cases.
“They’re coming down, but we’re not where they need to be yet,” she said. “We’ll just have to continue working to contain the outbreak, treat people, and get the rates back to where they were.”
The disease can potentially persist for decades if untreated, which can lead to death. During pregnancy, it poses a dangerous risk to the baby; congenital syphilis can cause bone deformities, severe anemia, jaundice, meningitis and even death.
The state had the highest rate of congenital syphilis in the country in 2023 with 54 cases, which was 482.1 cases per 100,000 births. Congenital syphilis cases are below that pace this year but remain higher than 2020, with eight cases reported so far. 
While efforts to address syphilis among adults as a whole have yielded results, efforts to screen pregnant women have been less successful. That’s because some women are not receiving prenatal care, Curry O’Connell said, which means they aren’t getting screened and monitored leading up to birth.
Curry O’Connell said she worries potential cuts to Medicaid by Congress and the Trump administration will worsen access to maternal care in the state, which could affect work to screen and catch syphilis.

The National Institutes of Health’s sweeping cuts of grants that fund scientific research are inflicting pain almost universally across the U.S., including in most states that backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.
The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska and Texas.
The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.
Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”
NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
  Harm to HIV, Vaccine Studies 

The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.
Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.
For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”
Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.
“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.
“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
  A Hit to Rural Health 

Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.
Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”
Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
The NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
  Researchers Can’t ‘Just Do It Again Later’ 

The NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported more than 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.
After pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers.
“We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
Other researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”
  Methodology 

KFF Health News analyzed National Institutes of Health grant data to determine the states and organizations most affected by the Trump administration’s cuts.
We tallied the number of terminated NIH grants using two sources: a Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants published April 4; and a crowdsourced list maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as of April 8. We focused on the first month of terminations: from Feb. 28 to March 28. We found that 780 awards were terminated in total, with 770 of them going to recipients based in U.S. states and two to recipients in Puerto Rico.
The analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements, which we know happened in at least one instance.
Additional information on the recipients, such as location and business type, came from the USAspending.gov Award Data Archive.
There were 222 U.S. recipients in total. At least 94 of them were public higher education institutions. Forty-one percent of organizations that had NIH grants cut in the first month were in states that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election.
Some recipients, including the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are medical facilities associated with higher education institutions. We classified these as hospitals/medical centers.
We also wanted to see whether the grant cuts affected states across the political spectrum. We generally classified states as blue if Democrats control the state government or Democratic candidates won them in the last three presidential elections, and red if they followed this pattern but for Republicans. Purple states are generally presidential battleground states or those where voters regularly split their support between the two parties: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was also blue.
We found that, of affected U.S. institutions, 96 were in red or purple states and 124 were in blue states.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington residents will soon face heftier fines for littering and higher prices for plastic grocery bags.
A new law signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Saturday toughens the punishment for littering and delays requirements for retailers to offer thicker bags for sale from Jan. 1, 2026 until 2028. 
The Legislature will use the two years to review the state’s reusable bag policies, Ferguson said. Retailers who sell thicker bags before the mandate is in effect will be penalized four cents a bag, under the new law.
“We’re called the Evergreen State and is it really evergreen with all the litter?” said Rep. Mark Klicker, R-Walla Walla, sponsor of House Bill 1293. “Our freeways, our interstates, are just packed with litter, it’s horrible.” 
The state’s low fines could be a reason why “people don’t really care” about littering, Klicker said, noting Oregon has a higher penalty for littering. Washington’s new law raises the penalty from a class three to a class two civil infraction. 
The fine will increase from $103 to $256, which includes all state mandated charges, according to legislative staff. The fine would apply to amounts up to one cubic foot, or roughly the size of a backpack. The new law will take effect in late July.
Over the past five years, the number of Washington State Patrol encounters with suspected litterers decreased from 636 in 2019 to 258 in 2024. Most of those resulted in verbal warnings rather than citations, according to state patrol data.
While the state patrol tallied fewer contacts, the amount of litter has not decreased, Klicker said. He originally wanted a task force to study possible ways to better deal with the problem but that part was removed. 
The Senate added language to delay the date when retail establishments would be required to provide thicker, reusable plastic bags to customers.
“Increasing the thickness of the bag isn’t going to help people keep the bags,” Klicker said. “They’ll throw the bags away anyway, so it creates that much more litter into the landfills.”
In 2020, the state passed a law banning single-use plastic bags and required retail establishments to offer paper bags or thicker, reusable plastic bags for sale to consumers.
Reusable plastic bags are currently sold for eight cents and required to be a thickness of 2.25 mils. One mil is a unit of thickness equal to one-thousandth of an inch. The 2020 law increased the price to 12 cents and the thickness to four mils on Jan. 1 2026. But the Senate delayed the change in thickness by two years.
Retailers who sell reusable plastic bags with a thickness of at least four mils before 2028 will be penalized four cents a bag. Customers will see a total charge of 16 cents for each bag on their receipts.
The four cent penalty will be deposited in the Waste Reduction, Recycling, and Litter Control Account to address the negative impacts of litter which will go away in 2028.
The price for paper bags will remain at eight cents per bag.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0166-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-18 09:00:40.872257

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7-1 in Plessy v. Ferguson that racial segregation on railroads or similar public places was constitutional, forging the “separate but equal” doctrine that remained in place until 1954. 
In his dissent that would foreshadow the ruling six decades later in Brown v. Board of Education, Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote that “separate but equal” rail cars were aimed at discriminating against Black Americans. 
“In the view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens,” he wrote. “Our Constitution is color-blind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful.

The work of building and maintaining infrastructure is no longer just brute force labor — it’s technical, creative and increasingly reliant on sophisticated technologies.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov. John Rodgers: Building opportunities for our youth and businesses.","This commentary is by John Rodgers. He is the lieutenant governor of Vermont and continues to operate the family farm, his 35-year-old masonry business, his excavating business and a plowing business.Being a lifelong tradesman — stone mason and excavator, specifically — and now lieutenant governor, I feel obligated to utilize the resources of my office to encourage young (and disillusioned mid-career) Vermonters to embrace the opportunities available to them through the trades so that they may, too, experience success and fulfillment. At the same time, I know the state, as a whole, has an opportunity to collaborate with businesses to expand apprenticeships. A net positive for both working Vermonters and Vermont business. It’s a mission I am embracing with the help of my friends Christine Frost at Courtland Construction and Lisa Durocher at the Northwest Career and Technical Center. I invite you to join us.Vermont’s infrastructure — our roads, bridges, water systems, and stormwater control — is the backbone of our communities and economy. As our state struggles with aging public infrastructure, the need for timely repair, replacement and innovation has never been more urgent — to make no mention of the shortage of housing. Yet behind the shovels and backhoes is a crisis: the shrinking pipeline of skilled workers able to operate heavy equipment. The work of building and maintaining infrastructure is no longer just brute force labor — it’s technical, creative and increasingly reliant on sophisticated technologies. GPS-enabled machines, digital tablets, wireless communication tools and precision controls are now standard on modern heavy equipment. Today’s equipment operators need to be tech-savvy, safety-minded problem-solvers with strong communication skills and spatial awareness. This reality creates a promising opportunity for high school students, especially digital natives who already thrive in technology-rich environments. Careers in heavy civil industries can offer excellent pay, long-term stability and the satisfaction of building lasting public works. Yet, despite these benefits, students are rarely exposed to this pathway early enough to pursue it. Career and Technical Education centers have a crucial role to play. These programs provide hands-on experience, industry-aligned training and a direct pipeline to jobs that are vital to our economy. In Vermont, CTE’s effectiveness is undeniable.As of June 2024, 64.9% of CTE students graduated with an industry-recognized credential, and 46% earned college credit — up from about 20% a few years ago. These gains highlight the system’s adaptability and responsiveness, largely due to support from federal initiatives like the Perkins V grant. However, the limitations are real and growing. The high cost of launching heavy equipment programs, from acquiring machinery to building simulation labs, places a major strain on already limited budgets.Meanwhile, recruiting instructors who bring real-world experience into the classroom is an uphill battle. Industry professionals earn significantly more in the private sector than CTE centers can offer. Without these qualified instructors, we lose the bridge between students and meaningful career opportunities. This workforce shortage isn’t a distant threat, it’s a present-day reality. Without sustained investment in CTE infrastructure, staffing, and programming, we are not only failing our students, we are also jeopardizing our future infrastructure.Communities depend on people who know how to safely and efficiently operate the machines that build our roads, lay our sewer lines, build and renovate our homes, and maintain our bridges. If we don’t act now, we risk an even greater shortage in the years to come. The solution is within reach. Strategic public investment, industry partnerships and creative solutions to recruiting educators and acquiring training equipment can make a powerful difference. With the right support, we can build the workforce we need to meet the current and future infrastructure demands.When you grow up milking cows, banging nails and running — and fixing — equipment, your formative years on a Vermont farm are where you receive your CTE. And while the Vermont of today is different from that of my youth, there will always be a need for the Vermont work ethic and “get-er done” spirit. Our young people deserve the opportunities I had, and our businesses and communities need our young people. Please join us in investing in our state and young people by supporting career and technical education.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov.

Tom Lee, Tampa Bay Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez, and lobbyist Ron Pierce at the Tampa Tiger Bay Club in Ybor City on May 16, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida voters amended the state Constitution subjecting legislators to eight-year term limits more than three decades ago. But as this year’s legislative session continues with no end in sight, the issue of whether term-limits are working for all Floridians was the topic of debate at the Tampa Tiger Bay Club on Friday afternoon.
“I’ve seen a lot happen,” said Tampa Bay area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, the longest-serving member of the Legislature, who was first elected to the House in 2008. “The downside is the experts become the staff, and to some extent, the lobbyists, and to a larger extent, not so much the legislator … so I think it has its drawbacks.”
“Term limits have completely empowered lobbyists,” agreed Ron Pierce, a lobbyist himself who worked for eight years as a legislative staffer and has headed RSA Consulting Group since 2009.
The term-limit law became an issue earlier this year when Brevard County House Republican Debbie Mayfield filed to run for the Senate seat in which she had served from 2016-2024.
After she was term-limited from running again last fall, she instead ran and won a seat in the Florida House. But after the newly elected senator in District 19, Randy Fine, quit to run for and win a seat in Congress, Mayfield filed to run for that Senate seat again in a special election.
The Florida Division of Elections ruled that she couldn’t run again for the seat because of the term limit law. She challenged that ruling, and the Florida Supreme Court ruled for her unanimously in February, stating that her gap in serving in the Senate from November until February allowed her to run again for the Senate seat in a special election (which is slated to take place on June 10).
Concurrent to that drama, Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia filed a resolution during the session (SJR 536) that would have clarified that the law imposes a lifetime limit of 16 years in state legislative office — 8 years max in the House, 8 years max in the Senate — with a caveat for senators who serve reduced two-year terms due to redistricting.
The measure would have gone to the voters as a constitutional amendment in 2026, but stalled after being approved in one committee stop.
“Let’s stop the practice of people continually running for the same office and bouncing back and forth between chambers,” Ingoglia said on X. “Serving the people of Florida should be a privilege, and an honor, not a career.”
Voter-imposed
The “Eight is Enough” constitutional amendment in 1992, which passed with 77% of the vote, did not just include eight-year term limits for the state Legislature, but also for members of Congress, former Hillsborough County Republican state Sen. Tom Lee noted on Friday.
“That was the primary motivation behind it, and term limits for Congress was ultimately ruled to be unconstitutional,” he noted.
Former Tampa Democratic Sen. Janet Cruz, who served in the Legislature for more than a decade before losing a bid for re-election to the Senate in 2022, asked the panelists whether term limits even matter anymore because of “gerrymandered districts.”
Pierce insisted they absolutely do matter, citing the fact that when Rouson does leave the Senate next year because of term limits, his successor will not be nearly as experienced or have the same amount of influence.
“It has been around forever and isn’t going away,” Lee said regarding the issue of gerrymandering.
He added that the way that Republicans gained more seats in the Legislature starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s was because they built a coalition with Black and Hispanic Democrats to carve out seats “to ensure their election in minority-access districts in exchange for the rest of the map looking very Republican. And before you knew it, you had a Republican-dominated Legislature. That’s what happened.”
‘Who’s going to pay for that?’
Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez, a Democrat, served in the Florida House from 1998 until 2006, when he was term-limited from his seat. He said he could make the argument that the state would be better off if term-limits could be extended to 12 or even 16 years, but it would be “controversial” for any lawmaker to push for that proposal.
“There have been efforts to try increase term limits to a different number. I don’t know what that sweet spot is — 12 years, 16 years. None of those have gone very far within the state Legislature,” Henriquez said.
Pierce said he could support getting rid of term limits outright, but added that there’s no way that could possibly happen, since it would require getting them repealed via a constitutional amendment.
“You’ve changed some things in Tallahassee this year, I think, that made it a little more difficult for citizen’s initiatives in the future, that’s number one,” he said, referring to the legislation signed by Gov. DeSantis that will make the process more difficult to get a measure on the ballot.
The second problem, he said, is that it would look “self-serving” for lawmakers to push the measure. But he added that the biggest hurdle would be finding anyone to educate the public about why term-limits should be repealed. “Who in the world is going to try to educate the public on why you’re trying to change term-limits?” he asked. “Who’s going to pay for that?”
The discussion took place just days after Gov. Ron DeSantis travelled to Ohio to give his support for a resolution in that state’s Legislature to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot calling for a constitutional convention to impose congressional term limits. The Florida Legislature passed a resolution last year calling for a U.S. Term Limits convention.

With the latest federal court ruling, this is our state's reality once again.","The slow, steady increase in Black Mississippians being elected to public office is the direct result of actions of the federal government — the executive, legislative and most importantly the judiciary — and not because of actions of the state.
State officials have fought almost every effort of federal officials to expand voting rights for people of color and to increase the number of Black Mississippians holding public office. In the 1800s, the white political leadership crafted a state constitution, rooted in white supremacy and designed to block Black Mississippians from having or obtaining political power. Those Jim Crow efforts, well documented over the years, ranged from poll taxes to literacy tests and more. In the 1960s, laws were passed in Mississippi allowing potential voters to be disqualified based on their “character.”
Those efforts have continued to the modern day with efforts of white leaders to gerrymander political districts to weaken the political influence of Black Mississippians. And sometimes, those efforts have included reluctance and even outright refusal of white power brokers to remove some of those Jim Crow provisions.
The latest response from the federal courts to these continued decisions by the state’s white leaders is a recent ruling that forces the creation of three more Black-majority legislative seats: two in the Senate and one in the House.
As a result of that ruling, later this year candidates in 14 legislative districts (five in the House and nine in the Senate) will have to run in special elections.
Creating the three new Black-majority districts required the redrawing of multiple districts — 14 in this case — around the areas where the new districts were created.
It should not be a surprise that most if not all of those lawmakers are not happy that they are being forced to run for reelection in the middle of their four-year term. But this reality is the result of the Mississippi House and Senate leaders approving a redistricting plan that the federal courts found did not provide adequate representation for Black Mississippians.
The requirement forcing legislators to run in special elections is not unprecedented. In 1991, the Legislature passed a redistricting plan that was supposedly based on population shifts found in the 1990 Census. But the U.S. Department of Justice claimed, and the federal courts agreed, that the redistricting plan did not create enough Black-majority districts based on the population of the state.
After considerable legal maneuvering, the House and Senate created a legislative redistricting plan that the federal courts found did not dilute Black voter strength.
The federal courts ordered that all 174 House and Senate members run in a special election in 1992 under those newly drawn, racially fairer districts only a year after they had won election to a new four-year term. Many legislators were not happy about that.
To make matters worse in the mind of those lawmakers, they were having to run a year after passing over the veto of then-Gov. Kirk Fordice a 1-cent increase in the sales tax on retail items. Fordice promised to campaign in the special election against the lawmakers who approved the sales tax increase.
There is little evidence that Fordice was successful in defeating lawmakers because of the tax increase.
But the special election did result in a significant increase in Black representation in the Mississippi Legislature. As a result of that special election, the number of Black members of the 52-member Mississippi Senate increased from four to 10 and increased from 20 to 31 in the 122-member Mississippi House.
Those numbers have slowly but steadily increased since then because of the nature of population shifts and, yes, because of additional federal court actions.
The Black population of Mississippi is currently about 38%, and the Black voting-age population is a little less than that.
Even with these three new Black-majority districts approved recently by the federal courts, there will be 43 Black-majority districts in the House, making up just 35% of the membership in the 122-member chamber. On the other side of the Capitol, there are 16 Black-majority districts, comprising about 31% of the 52-member Senate.
Thanks to action of the federal government — and certainly not the state — the Mississippi Legislature continues to inch closer to a representation that looks like the demographics of Mississippi. But it’s still not there.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06174816/AP_21239459273852-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-18 07:59:45.564471

71 years after Brown -- and 50 years after the beginning of Boston busing -- Massachusetts schools remain deeply segregated by race and class. 
The post 71 years later, Massachusetts must deliver on the promise of Brown vs. Board of Education  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN MY Complexities of Urban Schooling class at Clark University, I have spent the last five years teaching future educators about the challenges and opportunities of US public schools, past and present.  The course is at the intersection of education, history, geography, political science, and sociology, using a mix of primary source historical documents, research studies, policy briefs, documentaries, and even TED Talks to frame our discussions and the student-led solutions to some of the most pressing challenges. A favorite TED Talk of mine in this class is one by Kandice Sumner, a fellow Massachusetts educator. Sumner grew up in Boston and was enrolled in METCO, a voluntary school integration program that sends Boston and Springfield students to suburban schools. In the TED Talk, Sumner discusses how her own METCO experience informed her approach as a teacher in Boston schools, and how, even with that integration program, many of her students faced the same segregated classrooms that she escaped. “Teaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine, the Civil Rights Movement,” she says in the TED Talk, ”is a real awkward moment in my classroom, when I have to hear the voice of a child ask, ‘If schools were desegregated in 1954, how come there are no white kids here?’’” I can always count on an audible reaction from my students to that moment in her talk. And that jaw dropping line sums up so much about where we stand today—71 years to the week after the Supreme Court famously declared, in Brown vs. Board of Education, that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.”  While talk of school segregation from that period often conjures images of the American South, we know too well from Boston’s ignoble history that the stain of school segregation was present in communities throughout the country.  The bad news is that 71 years after Brown — and 50 years after the beginning of Boston busing — Massachusetts schools remain deeply segregated by race and class. The good news is that together, we can transform our schools and classrooms into the dynamic, diverse, and well-resourced learning spaces that our kids and communities deserve. I began my own teaching career about 20 years ago at the Edwards Middle School in Charlestown, the school that Boston’s former acting mayor, Kim Janey, was bused to in the 1970s.  That chapter of our story is only part of the unique and storied history of the fight in Massachusetts for excellent and equitable schools for all kids. While it has been 71 years since Brown, we actually mark 170 years in Massachusetts this year since the legal abolition of segregated schools, in 1855, the result of lawsuits and public protest led by Black families in Boston. In an 1848 letter from the first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, Horace Mann lays out the most lofty and aspirational goals for our then fledgling school system. “Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin,” he wrote, “is the great equalizer of the conditions of men — the balance-wheel of the social machinery.” Today we continue to strive toward Mann’s vision and Brown’s promise, schools that are the bedrock of community, opportunity, and the future we want for our children. The imperative is not only a matter of economic and racial equity, but of our shared democratic future. As the Supreme Court majority asserted of this integrated and equitable education in the Brown decision, “It is the very foundation of good citizenship.” Indeed, studies suggest that integrated schools prepare students to engage in democratic processes and increase civic participation. Despite that critical need, more than 225,000 students attend racially segregated non-white schools in the state, and Massachusetts public schools are among the most racially and economically segregated in the country.  According to data from The Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University, Massachusetts public schools are the sixth most segregated by income in the country, and only New Jersey has higher levels of economic segregation between school districts.  Students of color are disproportionately hurt by these trends: the average Black or Hispanic student’s school serves almost 30 percentage points more students experiencing poverty than the average white student’s school. The consequences are real, and visible in graduation rates, student disengagement, and college matriculation. We know it doesn’t need to be this way. In fact, we know that most of us here in Massachusetts don’t want it to be this way.  Two years ago, Brown’s Promise, a national nonprofit, was launched to combat school segregation in the US. This week, the first state chapter of Brown’s Promise is opening here in Massachusetts – a place with a rich history, both for better and worse, in the fight to ensure quality education for all. Our mission is to turn the vision of integrated, fully funded schools into a reality for all students, regardless of background.  My colleagues at Brown’s Promise have already been talking to many people in community gatherings across the state, and the results are clear. Families, educators, students, and advocates across Massachusetts agree that every child deserves the same opportunity to thrive regardless of race, income, or zip code.  In recent Springfield, Holyoke, and Lynn community engagement sessions, participants consistently expressed interest in understanding and addressing how segregation, district lines, and funding policies undermine educational quality. We will continue those community conversations and work with partners to analyze policy options to figure out what changes make the most sense in Massachusetts. We know that every community is different and will require different approaches. To help guide this work, Brown’s Promise has outlined five policy solutions already: Fund public schools fully and fairly Rethink school district lines  Ensure integration within districts  Center positive student experiences Cultivate a supportive policy ecosystem I am excited to work with policy leaders, students, and educators to make these things concrete in Massachusetts, and am learning already from the conversations that have already happened in communities across the Commonwealth. For example, families and students in early conversations have been particularly interested in the creation of a series of regional, themed magnet schools that enroll students across district lines without any admissions tests, with free transportation, and with a lottery that ensures socioeconomic diversity.  Massachusetts ranked No. 1 on the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, leading the nation in public education outcomes, but those of us on the ground in our communities know that this does not tell the whole story.  I saw firsthand as a youth worker years ago in Boston, Lowell, Holyoke, and Worcester the ways in which that top-ranked education is out of reach for many of our students of color and/or low-income students. We know that together we can build schools for every child to thrive. Together, we can add our own chapter to the storied history of Massachusetts’ educational leadership for all.  Today, as a parent of a Worcester Public School student and a longtime educator, I am excited to continue these conversations in cities and towns across the Commonwealth to build a shared vision of equitable and excellent schools for all of our kids. Together, we can deliver on Brown’s promise, and ensure that our kids get the integrated and equitable schools that every kid deserves.  Cara Berg Powers is Massachusetts state director for Brown’s Promise, a nonprofit organization advocating for integrated, well-resourced public schools.

The project would have created between 16 and 20 rental units in the community’s century-old town hall while retaining space for town offices.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Let’s get back to work’: Greensboro grapples with vote against affordable housing project.","Two days before Greensboro voted on a contentious proposal to redevelop the town hall into affordable housing, longtime resident and brand-new selectboard member Judy Carpenter wrote a post on Front Porch Forum.“Residents and friends of Greensboro, the big decision is coming,” she said. “No, I don’t mean Tuesday’s vote on the future of the Town Hall. I mean what we all do as community members after that vote.”The housing project saw more than a year of passionate debate, spanning meetings — some organized by the town and others organized by community members themselves — a petition, yard signs, letters, a community website, numerous information sheets and a myriad of internet postings.In the end, residents delivered a clear message, voting 227 to 147 against signing a purchase and sale agreement with non-profit Northeast Kingdom housing agency RuralEdge. However, the small community, which has the highest rate of second home ownership in the state, is left with a dire shortage of housing as well as a divided community.“Greensboro has survived contentious changes in the past—can we do it again?” Carpenter wrote. “No matter what the outcome of this vote is, we have many community projects in need of our efforts. Let’s get back to work.”READ MORE
“You never know until you have an election”The seeds of the town hall redevelopment project were planted around 2019, when both the town plan and a housing needs assessment detailed Greensboro’s “great need” for moderately-priced housing, especially for local employees. According to town documents, the planning commission’s housing committee began a relationship with RuralEdge around that time to develop housing, but had trouble finding a feasible site.In 2022, local non-profit WonderArts decided not to pursue renovating the town hall — a former high school — due to the expense. Town officials turned to the possibility of redeveloping their town hall into rental housing.RuralEdge is proposing to build 20 apartment units at the Greensboro town hall. The units would be spread between the upper floors of the current building and an addition attached to the back of the building. Schematic design courtesy of the Town of Greensboro. RuralEdge Executive Director Patrick Shattuck made an initial presentation of the project at the 2023 Greensboro Town Meeting, and the town signed an option agreement with Rural Edge in May 2023. Somewhere along the way, the project gained opposition, which grew louder and louder.Had the plan been approved, Rural Edge would have bought the building from the town for $500,000 and created between 16 and 20 affordable one- to three-bedroom apartments split between the current town hall and an addition at the back of the structure. The current town offices would have been rented back to the town at operating cost and the Giving Closet, a free community donation space, would have been maintained in perpetuity in approximately half the space.Shattuck said the town hall redevelopment would have been a really impactful project.“One thing that struck me is just the amount of need in Greensboro for housing and people’s willingness to share their personal stories of really being unhoused and the struggles that caused,” he said. “And these are folks who work in the businesses that are so imperative to Greensboro being Greensboro.”Schematic design courtesy of the Town of Greensboro. Shattuck expressed regret that the need won’t be addressed with a project that would have added a significant number of housing units.“It’s sad and frustrating, but you don’t want to force something when it isn’t necessarily the right time and place,” Shattuck said. “Hopefully some of these folks who voiced their concerns, you know, it will mobilize them to continue to work for the change they want to see in their community.”Kent Hansen, current chair of the Greensboro planning commission and a member of the housing subcommittee back when things began in 2019, said last week he was surprised by the outcome of the vote.“I thought that the vote would be closer,” he said. “But you never know until you have an election.”According to Hansen, there were several distinct complaints about the project. One was the scale: A number of people would have felt more comfortable with 8 or 10 units. Another group, he said, thought the town should be holding on to the building and fixing it up for community use.And a third group, he said, was upset with the process, feeling like the selectboard didn’t build up community consensus before signing the initial option agreement with RuralEdge in May 2023.David Kelley, a selectboard member at that time, disagreed with that characterization, stating in an email that there were “plenty of meetings and opportunities to learn” about the project before the option agreement was signed. However, he pointed to another complaint: that the concept of affordable housing “is not fully embraced by significant and influential segments of many communities.”One other struggle the selectboard faced? Rampant misinformation.On Wednesday night, at the first selectboard meeting since the vote, Ellen Celnik — a current selectboard member and an original member of the housing subcommittee — spoke up. She was happy there was a vote and happy the town made a decision, she said.“The one thing that I am truly saddened by is an anonymous mailer that was sent to voters that had an enormous amount of misinformation,” Celnik said. “A part of me, who has worked on this since 2019, really was disappointed with the level of divisiveness that was put out there that was coming from other sources … I hate seeing a small town being hoodwinked by a very small group of people.”At the meeting, the board noted a need to think long-term about the town hall, what it’s used for, and where the money is going to come from to make it useful; the building needs major repairs and the third floor is currently not usable.READ MORE
“It is going to take education, communication and stronger leadership”Looking ahead, Hansen said the planning commission has received a $25,000 municipal planning grant from the state, which they applied for before the vote. The grant aims to help Greensboro build consensus on where they want to grow geographically and what types of housing structures townspeople support.The process is slated to include major public outreach and meetings, an expansion of a survey and several community conversations the commission conducted this past winter. Hansen expects the work to be completed around September.“Hopefully people can pull together,” he said.In the meantime, other smaller housing projects and initiatives are in the works. For one, Shattuck said the very same morning he heard about the results of the vote, he signed a check to fund an accessory dwelling unit in Greensboro. Local businesses have encouraged such units, and a panel discussion about them held last fall in neighboring Craftsbury is thought to have generated at least six such dwellings.The Greensboro Initiative, associated with Central Vermont Habitat for Humanity and whose steering committee is chaired by Hansen, is in the process of constructing a new duplex in Greensboro Bend. The proceeds from the sale of those homes are planned to be reinvested in constructing additional affordable homes.One major local employer, Jasper Hill Farm, continues to take matters into its own hands. Mateo Kehler, co-founder of the artisan cheesemaking business and an outspoken proponent of the town hall redevelopment project, wrote in an email that Japer Hill currently provides housing for employees in eight houses.Kehler said the business recently purchased an additional six housing units (currently occupied by inherited tenants) to support their team, and is in the process of subdividing and selling another house to one of its key employees. Following the vote, he said Jasper Hill is reassessing its ambitions for future growth, particularly in Greensboro.“To make sure our efforts have the most impact, we will be shifting our direct support and investments towards surrounding towns that are more aligned with our mission,” Kehler wrote.Kehler said Jasper Hill also plans to continue its focus on housing by engaging local organizations, including Let’s Build Homes, a pro-housing coalition (Kehler serves on its board), and the Headwaters Community Trust, a community land trust serving Greensboro and three neighboring towns — both of which were launched this year.Kelley, when looking back on the rejected project, noted that Greensboro’s struggle to create affordable housing is not unique. The problem is accelerating across Vermont and the country, he said — and the anger that has fueled recent national and local elections is not going to solve it.“It is going to take education, communication and stronger leadership,” he wrote. “And as a member of our Select Board, I think we failed on those accounts.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Let’s get back to work’: Greensboro grapples with vote against affordable housing project.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Greensboro-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-18 06:59:05.147097

Photo courtesy Lake Champlain Maritime MuseumNoah Diedrich is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Those large yellow buoys floating atop Lake Champlain aren’t for monitoring the weather, nor are they for decoration. Instead, they mark the final resting places of centuries-old ships that wrecked on the lakebed.The floats are part of the Underwater Preservation Program, a 40-year-old initiative run by the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum that aims to uphold the federal Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987. The act looks to prevent historic wrecks from being disturbed by treasure hunters and salvagers. The museum oversees shipwrecks on Vermont’s side of the lake. “This preserve system is one of the very first in the nation,” said Chris Sabick, the museum’s executive director. “It really is a mechanism for the state to achieve its mandated goals of preservation and access to shipwreck sites.”Vermont’s system, implemented in 1982, has been a model that other states have replicated, Sabick said. The old ways of locating shipwrecks were hazardous to the wrecks themselves — a method the museum wants to avoid.“They would drag their anchor along until it snagged on something, and then they would dive down and see what that was,” Sabick said. “If that happened to be a shipwreck, it might take a piece of the shipwreck with it when you recovered the anchor or when the wind started blowing and pulled the shipwreck apart.”The current system provides a much less invasive technique. The yellow buoys mark the wrecks’ locations, and divers can follow buoys’ lines down to submerged signage identifying each wreck and providing pointers on how to observe without impacting the sites. The wrecks range from steamships to schooners, with most dating back to the early 1800s. A popular wreck is the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry, which is exactly what it sounds like — a horse-powered ferry that sank around 1814. The preserve program, now in its 40th year, is looking to expand access to the shipwrecks for non-divers, Sabick said. One such addition is taking visitors to wreck sites by boat and using remote-operated vehicles to transmit a live feed of the wreck to a TV screen on deck. The museum also created composite 3D models of the wrecks from digital images taken of the sites, which can be viewed on its website from anywhere with an internet connection. A still image from a 3D model of the General Butler, a wrecked schooner in the lake. Photo courtesy Lake Champlain Maritime Museum“It’s just broadening the access to these sites, even for people that aren’t local or aren’t divers,” Sabick said. H.494, a capital bonds bill, would allot $46,000 to the Underwater Preserves Program, an annual appropriation that goes toward site inspections and maintenance. The yearly sum increased from $36,000 in the past few years as the program added two new shipwreck sites. The bill has already passed through the Vermont House and now sits in the Senate. A committee of conference reported on Tuesday that it is recommending the upper house withdraw its recommended amendment .The proposed changes do not affect the allotment to the preserves program. Laura Trieschmann, state historic preservation officer, said the museum has been a tremendous partner that brings life to the wrecks. “They’re not just manning the wrecks with buoys and getting the permits,” she said. “They’re researching the stories of these places so that they’re not just a pile of wood on the bottom of the lake.”About 600 divers visit the wrecks each year, which contributes greatly to the continuation of the preservation program, Trieschmann said. “They’re not going to be around forever,” she said, “(considering) the nature of where they are and mussels and things like that could damage them, as well as boats. We definitely want to showcase them while we can.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lake Champlain shipwreck program to expand access to non-divers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/diver-shipwreck-lake-champlain-e-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-18 06:59:05.147097

The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.













Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project





During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
 Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
 Calls for a cultural shift on expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.













Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.





Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

Her tenure encompassed President Donald Trump’s first term, a time when staff still addressed the “full range of complaints”  — from racial and gender discrimination to schools denying services to students with disabilities.

But to Simons, the Justice Department’s recent dismissal of a school desegregation order in Louisiana — at a time when racial and socioeconomic isolation continues — is a sign that the current administration has turned its back on students who don’t receive an equal education. It’s why she left the Educational Opportunities Section at the DOJ after 14 years  in April.
“The administration has been very clear that resources are going to be allocated to certain identified priorities,” she said — primarily keeping trans students out of women’s sports and punishing universities it accuses of tolerating anti-semitism. But that agenda, she said, “is leaving a lot of parents and kids with nowhere to turn.”
Now she aims to be part of a solution. She’s lending her expertise to a new initiative intended to give families another way to resolve their concerns — the Public Education Defense Fund.
The National Center for Youth Law, a 50-year-old nonprofit, launched the project on Friday to help families with complaints that the DOJ or the Office for Civil Rights at the Education Department either won’t acknowledge or no longer has the capacity to investigate. Simons will co-chair the fund’s advisory council.
Announced in advance of Saturday’s 71st anniversary of the Brown v. Board decision ending segregation, the effort will include a fellowship program for former OCR attorneys who lost their positions when the Trump administration gutted the agency and closed seven regional offices in March. The goal is to capitalize on the “brain drain” caused by the elimination of nearly 250 OCR staffers and connect families with pro-bono attorneys who can conduct investigations and bring lawsuits to resolve their concerns.
“I have zero confidence in [the department’s] ability to administer the system effectively,” said Johnathan Smith, chief of staff and general counsel at the center. “I think most parents who are looking at what’s happening probably would reach the same conclusion.”

Thousands of Student Civil Rights Cases Left Adrift After Trump Guts Ed Dept

 




As it shifts attention away from discrimination against LGBTQ students and racial minorities, OCR has left thousands of complaints untouched and dismissed many others. Trump’s 2026 budget proposal calls for an additional 35% cut to the office as the administration pushes to eliminate the department.
The center, along with parents and special education advocates, sued the department over the firings, and asked the District of Columbia federal court to immediately reinstate staff. A hearing is set for May 20.
Andy Artz was a supervising attorney in OCR’s New York City office until March 11, when the department placed him and hundreds of other department staffers on leave and locked them out of their computer systems. He was in the middle of helping a student who had been denied access to a senior trip because of multiple disabilities and close to reaching a resolution for a victim of sexual assault by a classmate.
“I found the work really meaningful,” said Artz, who hopes to work with the fund. “OCR was able to do a great job helping school districts and universities understand their obligations.”
To the new administration, however, OCR perpetuated discrimination by focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion and harmed women by extending Title IX protections to transgender students.
“Let me be clear: it is a new day in America,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said when the department announced an investigation into a gender-neutral bathroom in Denver schools. “Under President Trump, OCR will not tolerate discrimination of any kind.”
Even if the court blocks the job cuts, it’s unclear whether attorneys would be allowed to return to cases that don’t align with the administration’s priorities. Smith still sees a need for the new project.
His team will work with local NAACP chapters, bar associations and other community organizations to get the word out about the OCR alternative, Smith said.
In addition to seeking attorneys who will represent students pro-bono, the fund hopes to attract some of the talent forced to leave the federal government by offering four- to six-month fellowships. Attorneys will receive a $12,500 stipend and non-attorneys will receive $9,000. Depending on funding, Smith expects up to 10 fellows in the first round.

 ‘Top-performing personnel’

When Trump was inaugurated, OCR had over 12,000 open cases, according to its website. But the database hasn’t been updated since before the new administration took over. According to Julie Hartman, a department spokeswoman, OCR continues to “evaluate all legitimate complaints” and has initiated over 200 disability-related investigations and dozens related to Title IX and anti-discrimination laws.
“OCR’s staff is composed of top-performing personnel with years of experience enforcing federal civil rights laws who work vigorously to protect all Americans’ civil rights,” she said.
She declined to comment on the fund specifically, but said the department “welcomes support from — and has often worked with — outside groups who want to advocate for students and families and help those who believe that their civil rights have been violated.”
Factoring in staff reductions and those who left voluntarily, Artz estimates that only about a third of OCR’s staff remains out of the over 560 attorneys, supervisors and other employees who worked there last fall.

As Trump Shakes Up Oversight of Special Ed, Frustrated DC Parents Want Change

 




As a former deputy assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, Smith doesn’t solely blame Trump for OCR being “terribly backlogged.”
“It was a system that often was a black hole for families,” he said. “What does it mean to have an Office for Civil Rights that’s actually responsive to families and to young people?”
For Callie Oettinger, a Fairfax County, Virginia, parent and special education advocate, getting OCR to act has yielded mixed results. She has seen complaints linger for years as well as recent steps by the new administration to act on disability cases.
OCR still hasn’t completed a probe into her 2019 complaint that the Fairfax district denied transportation to students with disabilities who needed extra time to complete the PSAT. At the same time, she’s noticed an uptick in OCR investigations on more recent issues. Since early April, officials have responded to two complaints she’s involved in, one filed in December and another in March.
“It’s not clear why they’re starting where they’re starting,” she said. “Things are definitely moving forward, but they’re not doing themselves a favor by keeping their website so outdated.”

Others are looking elsewhere for relief.
In Delaware’s Cape Henlopen School District, Louise Michaud Ngido, an English language teacher, said she’s heard nothing about her complaint that schools have failed to provide English learners with adequate support. Students new to the country, she said, don’t receive specific English development classes and staff members don’t provide translation services or interpreters for parents. The district denied any discrimination.
Under Cardona, OCR opened an investigation last October, but Ngido has heard nothing since. She said she hopes Delaware will be “more proactive” and investigate complaints that OCR won’t.
 Department of Justice priorities

At least one Republican proposal to eliminate the education department would shift OCR’s workload to the DOJ. But the education staff there has always been a fraction of the size of OCR’s. Simon’s former office once had 40 attorneys. Now, she said, it has six.
The agency’s priorities have also changed.
In an interview with the Epoch Times, a conservative media outlet, Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said her agenda includes doing “some law enforcement” against hospitals conducting gender-affirming surgeries, elevating parental rights and dismissing school district consent decrees over desegregation.
The DOJ said in a press release that it ended its “probing federal oversight” of integration efforts in Louisiana’s Plaquemines Parish schools because the district was spending “precious local resources” to meet past administration’s demands for data on issues such as hiring and discipline.
In the interview, Dhillon said the department wants to “let people off the hook” if they corrected past discrimination. Consent decrees, in which a district pays a court-appointed monitor for ongoing oversight, are “a powerful tool” and appropriate when there’s been severe corruption or racism, she said. “What’s not appropriate is to maintain these rent-seeking financial arrangements …  beyond their normal life cycle.”
But Simons, the former DOJ section chief, said Black students are still disciplined at higher rates than their white peers and are more likely to attend “crumbling” schools. Research shows that racial and socioeconomic isolation has steadily increased since the 1980s.
“Segregation persists; inequality persists,” she said.
Working with universities to collect and preserve existing data is another one of the fund’s goals. The administration, Smith said, might point to a declining number of OCR complaints as evidence of fewer problems in schools, when, in fact, it’s a byproduct of fewer investigations.
“We want to be able to counter that narrative by showing that just because people aren’t going to OCR doesn’t mean that there aren’t real concerns and real issues of discrimination in our schools,” he said.

 ‘The aid of legal counsel’

Jackie Wernz, a civil rights attorney and consultant who worked at the department during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said it’s important for nonprofits like the center to “step up,” but cautioned that outside efforts have limitations.
“Without a robust federal civil rights arm, civil rights in this country are not going to be enforced,” she said.
States don’t have the same expertise and resources, she said, and it’s unclear who would enforce any changes.
But Smith countered that the bulk of what OCR investigators do is negotiate solutions between families and district staff.
“Having parents and children do that with the aid of legal counsel,” he said, “will yield far better results and outcomes than if they try to navigate those systems on their own.”

Reproductive health advocates are sounding the alarm over the case of a pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead months ago but must now stay on life support, according to her family, because of the state’s strict abortion ban law.
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse from the metro Atlanta area, experienced a medical emergency in February that involved blood clots in her brain. Smith, who was about nine weeks pregnant at the time, was declared legally dead, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station 11Alive Action News.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Newkirk said that staff at Emory University’s network of hospitals told her they cannot remove the devices that are helping Smith to breathe because of the state’s six-week abortion ban. The staff said they are legally required to keep Smith breathing until the fetus reaches viability, Newkirk added.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk told the television station of Smith, who also has a 5-year-old son. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.”
The case puts a spotlight on the consequences of restrictive abortion bans following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to an abortion. Georgia’s abortion ban has an exception for a pregnancy that threatens the life of the pregnant person. But Smith’s case doesn’t fall under those exceptions, her family said. Since Smith is brain-dead, the pregnancy no longer poses a risk to her life. And because Smith’s fetus still has a heartbeat, the family said that she must still be kept on life support to comply with Georgia’s abortion ban.
Rep. Nikema Williams, an Atlanta-area Democrat, said in a statement Friday that Smith and her family “deserve better.”
“Everyone deserves the freedom to decide what’s best for their families, futures, and lives. Instead, anti-abortion politicians like Donald Trump and Governor Brian Kemp are forcing people through unimaginable pain,” Williams said. “Adriana’s story is gut-wrenching. It’s also a painful reminder of the consequences when politicians refuse to trust us to make our own medical decisions.”

Smith initially sought medical treatment in February for intense headaches, according to her mother. She went to Northside Hospital, where she was given medication and sent home. The following day, at her home, her boyfriend found her gasping for air. Representatives for Northside Hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Smith was then seen by and sent to different doctors throughout the Emory University hospital system, including Emory University Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. A CT scan showed blood clots in her brain. She was subsequently declared brain-dead, which means she is considered legally dead.
Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Newkirk said the hospital staff told her they plan to keep her daughter breathing until she is at least 32 weeks pregnant.
Representatives for Emory told the Associated Press that the hospital network could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules but said in a statement: “Emory Healthcare uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.”
Despite historic indictment, doctors will keep mailing abortion pills across state lines

Alicia Stallworth, director of Georgia campaigns for the reproductive rights advocacy group Reproductive Freedom for All, called Smith’s condition “a devastating tragedy.”
“But what makes it even more unconscionable is that her family has been denied the space and dignity to grieve,” said Stallworth. “Instead of being allowed to say goodbye, they are being forced to endure an agonizing limbo because of the state’s extreme abortion ban. This is not care. This is not justice. It is a cruelty rooted in a system that refuses to see Black women as fully human, even in death.”
Newkirk told 11Alive Action News, Georgia’s NBC affiliate, that the state’s strict abortion laws have robbed her family of the choice about whether to continue Smith’s pregnancy and the ability to make decisions on their own terms. They’re now left in limbo and facing the prospect of paying for several more weeks of expensive medical care.
“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision,” Newkirk told the station. “And if not, then their partner or their parents.”
Smith’s fetus also has fluid on his brain, Newkirk said, carrying unknown implications for his health and future.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said.
“This decision should’ve been left to us. Now we’re left wondering what kind of life he’ll have — and we’re going to be the ones raising him,” she said.
Members of the House Reproductive Freedom Caucus, co-chaired by Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, said in a Friday statement that “there is no desensitizing to the horror of this moment.”
“Adriana’s mother spent Mother’s Day watching her daughter undergo unconscionable medical torture by orders of the state,” they said. “Her young son spent Mother’s Day thinking his mom was just asleep and will soon wake up to hold him again. There are no words that can provide clarity or comfort. There is only the promise that we will say her name until her family sees peace and justice.”
Black women face higher maternal mortality rates in the United States and in Georgia, a public health crisis that has been underscored by the loss of federal abortion rights.
Smith’s case is the latest instance in which Georgia’s six-week abortion ban and its impacts on Black women have made national news. In 2024, the investigative newsroom ProPublica reported on the cases of two other Black women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died of infections after seeking to end their pregnancies in the state. The state’s maternal mortality review committee determined that both deaths were preventable, the outlet reported.
Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong, an Atlanta-based reproductive justice organization focused on women of color, is also the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the state’s six-week abortion ban. In a statement Wednesday, she noted that Smith, a registered nurse, knew how to advocate for herself and navigate the medical system. Still, she didn’t get the treatment she needed until it was too late. Black women, she said, “must be trusted when it comes to our health care decisions.”
“We’ve sounded the alarm for years,” Simpson said. “Yet, after the devastating and preventable deaths of multiple Black women, the message still rings clear: our lives are on the line, and our human right to bodily autonomy has been violated. Our bodies are not battlegrounds for political power plays.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-18 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"One skirmish over the CT budget is over, but the big battle looms",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/18/ct-budget-battle-looms/,Last week's deal among Gov. Ned Lamont and Democrats solved one problem but sets the stage for budget battles that could continue for years.,"At first glance, last week’s budget brinkmanship between Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly’s Democratic majority was over a mundane issue.
When would Connecticut take $300 million out of its $6.5 billion pile of unused cash to make mandatory Medicaid payments to clinics, social service agencies and other providers that treat the poor?
But beneath this procedural conflict was a much bigger battle over the budget controls that helped generate the state’s $4.1 billion rainy day fund — accumulated largely since Lamont took office in 2019 — and the $2.4 billion surplus projected for this fiscal year.
Lawmakers used loopholes for years to avoid a showdown with the fiscally moderate governor and to spend billions outside of a cap system many complain saves excessively to the detriment of education, health care and other core services.
But the chief loophole, nearly $3 billion in emergency federal COVID grants that could be spent regardless of cap limits, has largely been exhausted. 
And as other workarounds also become problematic, Democrats now refuse to constrain programs — at least not while an eight-year explosion of government reserves continues.
Lamont ended last week’s standoff late Thursday, agreeing to the first exception in 18 years to a spending cap that limits most budget growth to increases in household income or inflation. That will allow lawmakers to authorize $300 million next week for Medicaid payments, even though that action will push this fiscal year’s $26 billion budget marginally over the cap by at least $25 million. 
Had the governor not made this concession, providers were expecting that state payments owed in late May would be pushed back until after July 1, a delay some said would make them unable to cover payroll.
More importantly, the spending cap exception will open the door for Democrats and Lamont to compromise on a new two-year state budget, because roughly $300 million extra also will be appropriated to support the next budget cycle.
But with the governor and minority Republicans still championing these budget controls and many Democrats insisting the extra funding —  though helpful — won’t reverse years of fiscal neglect, last week’s struggle could be the first of several for years to come. The budget controls, which last were set in 2017, are largely fixed by law and contract until July 2028, but still can be adjusted with the governor’s consent.
Ritter: No new budget ‘If you don’t solve this Medicaid puzzle’
“If you don’t solve this Medicaid puzzle,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a mid-morning press conference last Thursday, “I don’t know how it all gets paid for.”
The speaker was referring not just to the latest payments owed providers who treat Connecticut’s poor but to planned investments over the next two years in K-12 education, public colleges and universities, municipal aid, social services, nursing homes and other health care programs.
At first glance, Connecticut has the resources it needs to handle all these challenges.
The state has amassed close to $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017, which represent 8% or more of the General Fund. The $2.4 billion cushion projected for this year represents 10%.
Lawmakers have used these post-2017 windfalls to build what was a tiny $212 million emergency reserve — barely larger than 1% of the budget — to a record-setting $4.1 billion, and to pay down more than $8.5 billion of the massive pension debt Connecticut incurred between 1939 and 2010. The state still owes more than $35 billion. And the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think-tank, last year ranked Connecticut’s per capita pension debt highest in the nation.
Critics, including some Democrats in the legislature, nonetheless say the state has overcompensated for its past poor savings habits, stashing cash too aggressively and weakening services for one generation to fix a debt problem created by three.
A spending cap exception of $300 million cannot offset the billions siphoned out of programs and into reserves and pensions over the last seven years, they add.
“We cannot continue to excuse the sufferings of our communities in order to irresponsibly manage our long-term liabilities,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a progressive coalition of faith, labor and other civic groups. 
Critics of the savings programs cite many shortfalls:

Connecticut hasn’t broadly adjusted Medicaid rates for doctors who treat low-income patients since 2007. A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states.


The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an advertising campaign this spring attacking Lamont for allowing the state’s overreliance on property taxes to worsen even as Connecticut’s coffers swell. Communities lose more than $400 million annually because statutory education grants — general aid, special education and funds for charter and magnet schools — haven’t kept pace with inflation, CCM says.


Nonprofit agencies serving clients with intellectual disabilities or struggling with mental illness say state payments effectively are down 30% since 2007 because they haven’t kept pace with inflation, costing providers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. “The safety net is ripping, whether people want to admit it or not,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.


And the state’s largest health care workers union recently set a May 27 strike deadline for about 6,400 caregivers at dozens of nursing and group homes, saying members can earn more serving fast food than they can assisting elderly residents and clients with disabilities.

“Every day there’s something more,” Ritter said, adding that a more comprehensive debate over budget controls is unavoidable in the coming years.
Lamont, GOP still expect Democrats to make hard choices
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the administration will continue working with legislators, but “the governor’s position has been clear throughout this process: the budget … must adhere to all constitutional and statutory requirements.”
Spending more than the cap permits this fiscal year means legislative leaders must secure not just bare majorities but 60% votes of approval in the House and Senate.
That comes with some political risk to Lamont, who must declare a state budget emergency before the limit can be surpassed — and who has not announced whether he will run for a third term next year.
State officials have legally exceeded the spending cap seven times since it was created in 1991 but not since 2007. That’s when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature, with GOP support, appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But after a severe recession pushed state finances deep into the red and triggered a historic $1.8 billion-plus tax hike in 2011, legally exceeding the cap became politically taboo.
Given the political sensitivity that surrounds the cap, the Lamont administration also has pushed Democrats to be more frugal. But it hasn’t always been successful.
Public colleges and universities’ budgets currently are propped up with roughly $270 million in federal pandemic grants that expire next fiscal year. The Democrat-controlled Appropriations Committee recommended a $55.7 billion two-year budget this spring that replaces much of that vanishing aid with state dollars.
But the Lamont administration notes that public colleges and universities have amassed more than $1 billion in reserves in recent years and should be required to spend some of that massive cushion down before getting more help from the Capitol.
House Republicans note that both the Appropriations Committee and Lamont failed to budget about $230 million requested by the comptroller’s office to cover contractually obligated health benefits for retired state workers over the next two fiscal years combined.
“I think we need to be honest about where we are and where we’re going,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
Connecticut will be hard-pressed to continue prioritizing paying down pension debt if it allows spending to grow quickly as it did for decades prior to 2017, he said.
The House GOP leader added that this past week’s Medicaid billing fight was unnecessary. Democratic legislators and Lamont ignored projections one year ago that showed Medicaid costs were surging, opting not to budget more or trim coverage levels to offset the anticipated demand.
House Republicans also say Connecticut could save tens of millions of dollars annually by ending Medicaid coverage for undocumented adults and children, an idea that Democrats consistently have rejected.
Lamont, GOP also struggle to stay under spending cap
But Democrats counter that Lamont and the GOP have their own struggles when it comes to budget controls.
Lamont, who called the cap “sacrosanct” during a January meeting with state business leaders, needed several gimmicks to keep the two-year spending plan he proposed in February under the limit.
Besides underfunding health care for retired state workers, Lamont also proposed paying for the $60 million-per-year Town Aid Road municipal grant with borrowing, which is spending-cap exempt, rather than including it in the budget. Towns can use TAR funds for capital projects, but many also use them to pay for winter snow plowing — a service not normally financed over many years with interest costs.
And after pledging to bolster Connecticut’s flagging child care industry, the governor recommended creating a $300 million fund outside of the budget and spending cap rules to support new investments in this area for many years to come.
House Republicans recommended a similar shift off-budget to back child care in the biennial plan they proposed earlier this month, while the Senate GOP declined to propose any state budget in this cap-constrained environment.
Democrats add they’ve taken great care to respect Lamont’s top fiscal priorities throughout his tenure, sometimes at the expense of public services.
The governor opposes raising taxes on wealthy households to finance greater state spending or tax relief for the poor or middle class, a position many of his fellow Democrats don’t share. And while the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee has endorsed some wealth-redistribution tax measures during Lamont’s tenure, legislative leaders haven’t included any in the budgets sent to the governor’s desk.
“They want no revenue increases and yet they want us to basically cut all of the things we think are important?” Ritter said. “Good budgets aren’t free. They cost money.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_540-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-18 05:00:52.503172

Usage spikes, not just rates, drive costs up. Eversource encourages energy-saving habits—like adjusting thermostats, using appliances off-peak, and switching to LEDs—to stay cool while managing expenses. Efficiency pro[...]","By Eversource
After a long, cold winter, warmer weather is finally here and many of us have been looking forward to shutting off the heat, packing away the coats, and spending more time outside. We all know how hot Connecticut summers can be, and it’s only a matter of time before the return of those scorching temperatures has us turning on the fans and cranking up the air conditioners again. But even with electric rates dropping this summer, it’s important to remember that when the mercury climbs, energy usage typically does too—and that’s what can cause your bill to spike.
Think of it this way: if you buy more groceries, you’d expect to pay more at checkout. If you drive your car more often than usual, you’d expect to pay more in gasoline. The more you use, the more you pay, and your energy bill is no different, as the most of it is based on usage. In Connecticut, the average residential customer uses about 35% more electricity to keep cool during the summer months. Last year, due to a record-breaking summer with multiple heat waves, that increase was even greater, and customers certainly saw the change reflected in their energy bills.
While the significant increase to the Public Benefits portion of the bill in July 2024 was one of the factors that led to higher bills last summer, usage was the number-one reason for the dramatic surge customers saw. If a homeowner used the exact same amount of energy from June to July last year (approximately 700 kWh on average), their Eversource electric bill would have increased by about $8. Even though Public Benefits increased, and Standard Service (the supply rate Eversource purchased from power generators for customers) decreased substantially at the same time, many of us saw an increase far larger than $8 on our summer bills — because of higher usage.
But those are last year’s numbers. What can you expect this year? There are two rate decreases happening. The first started May 1 with the Public Benefits portion of the bill going down. An average Eversource residential customer saw their total bill decrease by approximately $13.50. Energy supply is also expected to go down starting July 1, but even with those two decreases, you shouldn’t be surprised to see your bill go up this summer because of increased energy usage. 

How much energy you use, and therefore how much your bill total will be, depends on several factors, and weather is a big one. If blistering hot days dominate the summer months, your usage will naturally increase. Even if you keep your thermostat set at the same temperature, on a 90-degree day your system works much harder to keep your home or business cool compared to an 80-degree day, which means your usage has increased. 
This may leave you wondering: is there anything I can do to help keep costs down this summer? The answer is yes. Customers can take advantage of energy efficiency measures and programs because it all adds up and makes a difference for your bottom line. Setting your thermostat one degree higher can mean your air conditioner is using one to three percent less electricity. Turning on your major appliances, like dryers and dishwashers, in the morning or late evening hours means you’re not adding heat to your home during the hottest parts of the day. Switching to LEDs means your lights are running cooler and, as a bonus, last a lot longer than incandescent lights. For the windows that get a lot of sunlight shining in, closing the blinds will also help keep your home cooler. In addition, we offer a variety of energy efficiency programs that can help lower your usage and save money on certain products, as well as financial assistance and payment plans that can help you manage your monthly bills. 
We all want to stay cool during the summer months, but that doesn’t mean you can’t stay on budget too. We hope that by sharing these tips, tools, and information about the many solutions available to our customers, we can help you accomplish both.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)One afternoon not long ago, I walked the south lawn of the state Capitol at Topeka, camera in hand, seeking inspiration. I wasn’t looking for photographic subjects exactly, but something deeper, some sign or cypher that might be a key to hope in the early months of 2025.
Simply put, I was bone tired.
The American carnival of politics had left me numb.
During the five years I’ve written this column, I’ve shared my concern, anxiety, and outrage over state and national politics. I have at times warned of uncharted terrain and at others admitted fear, but now I must convey an existential cultural exhaustion. It is something that reaches down to the personal.
A week or so before driving the 58 miles from my front steps to roam the Capitol lawn, as we got into the Jeep to run some errand, Kim paused and pointed to the roof of our house. A course of shingles, about the size of a door, was missing on the south side, exposing the wood decking beneath. She had found the wind-ripped shingles on the ground on the other side of the house, but we hadn’t known where they had come from until that moment.
The bare patch of wood deck was over the center of the house. Below it was our second-floor bedroom, and below that was the living room where I played acoustic guitar a couple of times a week. The house is more than 100 years old, but the roof was rather new, and as I looked up at where the shingles had been, I imagined rainwater pouring into the heart of the house. I’m handy with tools when I’ve a mind to, but I’m afraid of heights. I muttered something to Kim about not worrying, that I would find somebody to climb up and fix it, but inside me something was shrieking like a stall alarm on a Cessna 172. There had been a series of weather-related challenges at home over the past two years, including a favorite maple tree blowing down on the garage. Due to professional setbacks, money was tight.
The missing shingles felt personal.
Those shingles were still on my mind when I went to Topeka for lunch business. I had placed a call to the contractor who originally put on the roof but had not yet received a response. At least the sky was clear that afternoon.
After lunch, I drove over and parked at the meters on the other side of the street from Capitol Police headquarters. I plugged the meter with four quarters, enough for an hour, and then slung my old Canon DSLR camera over my shoulder. There were a few people on the sidewalk, bags over their shoulders coming to or from work, and a handful of workman at the east entrance to the Capitol. But when I followed the sidewalk to the south lawn I found myself alone, amid green lawns, a few statues, and the immensity of the copper-domed building rising before me.
The solitude was restful.
I passed a sculpture of a seated Abraham Lincoln on my journey, then approached the Capitol and photographed a number of architectural features, steps, columns, pediments. I circled the flower beds. I went over and examined a ground-level replica of the Ad Astra statue atop the statehouse dome, an eight-foot Kansa warrior with drawn bow. Then I wandered back to the Lincoln statue, which I found oddly comforting.
The seated Lincoln faces away from the Capitol. One hand rests on a lanky knee. The face is of the bearded Lincoln, the one familiar to us from the profile on our pennies and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and Alexander Gardner’s 1865 “cracked plate” photograph. But while Gardner’s portrait carries a hint of a smile, the Lincoln on the state Capitol lawn is full of care and sorrow.
This sorrowful Lincoln offered wisdom.
I’m no Lincoln scholar. I cannot tell you anything about the flawed and fated man who led the nation through its greatest trial that you cannot read in a dozen biographies. Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who wrote “Team of Rivals,” has said that Lincoln suffered from depressive episodes so severe that his friends removed all razors and scissors from his room. Jon Meacham, another presidential historian, author of “There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,” has said Lincoln “was a politician — but a politician ultimately driven by conscience.”
Knowing that Lincoln went through dark periods of depression and managed to redeem the soul of America gives me hope. It isn’t an expectation that I am personally destined for greatness, but it is proof that seemingly overwhelming burdens can be endured.
I sometimes declare in my weaker periods that I can’t stand things anymore.
Kim observes: “And yet there you stand.”
Indeed, here we all stand. We may be frightened, anxious, at the end of collective or individual ropes, but as long as we remain standing we are not yet beaten. The primary task before us is to endure. To help others, we must ourselves remain on our feet.
The bronze statue of Lincoln at the Kansas Capitol was the first public commission by Merrell Gage. It was unveiled Feb. 12, 1918.
Gage, a 1911 graduate of Topeka High School, later studied sculpture with Gutzon Borglum, a bigot who carved Mount Rushmore. Gage, who taught for 33 years at the University of Southern California, considered Lincoln an “inexhaustible” subject. In 1955, Gage was the subject of a short documentary in which he sculpted the head of Lincoln from clay while talking about the president’s life. The film won an Oscar. Gage died in 1981.
Gage was an artist of his time, an era when poet Carl Sandburg produced a hagiographic biography of Lincoln that is now recognized as being more literature and less fact. But it is Sandburg’s Lincoln, perhaps more than any other single work, that shaped the perception of the 16th president as a benevolent and martyred father.
Each American generation interprets Lincoln anew. While Gage likely had Sandburg’s Lincoln in mind, my interpretation of Lincoln has been shaped by Goodwin and Meacham and others, including Steven Spielberg. It has also been skewed by Richard Nixon’s manic and impromptu visit with anti-war protestors at the Lincoln Memorial one night in May 1970. Lincoln continues to evolve in my understanding, as the dangers facing democracy have deepened.
These dangers have sharpened so fast that it is worth a moment to recount. It is the most grotesque freak show of any carnival midway.
Eighty years of global leadership has been endangered by the clumsy authoritarian urges of a president drunk with self-importance and enabled by a Congress controlled by a Quisling majority. The hunt for DEI in government is the new McCarthyism with a bigoted twist, due process is trammeled by mass deportations that send some detainees to a notorious foreign prison, and the U.S. turned its back on longtime military and commercial allies. The rolling crises lurch from the catastrophic to the absurd, from a tariff war that few credible economists understand to an apparatchik-worthy declaration that Veterans Day would be known as “Victory Day for World War I.” And then there is DOGE, the revenge-driven wrecking ball dismantling the federal government in the name of cost-saving efficiency.
All of this was predictable. Anybody who had paid attention to Donald Trump’s insane ramblings or was familiar with Project 2025 knew where we were headed. We are in the midst of a radical transformation of America into a bizarro-world of opposite values. The grifting of the presidency, from Trump’s crypto scam worth billions to the Qatari gift of a $400 million luxury jet to replace Air Force One, should dismay all but surprise none.
What has surprised me is the apparent inability of Democrats to mount a coherent political response. Oh, there have been scattered strong voices –Bernie Saunders, Cory Booker, AOC, Elizabeth Warren — but these seem like cries in the wilderness. Mass political protests, including the May Day event in Topeka, seem to have the most momentum. But at some point, to be effective, protest has to coalesce around a leader with a conscience who is able to articulate the case for democracy and a path forward to a better America.
Meanwhile, we must remain standing.
We do not need another Lincoln — our allotment was one — but we do need a human being and not a seated statue. Where will this individual come from? I have no idea. But they are surely already among us, if only we take the care to recognize them, flaws and all.
This is a time not only for resisting, but for knowing why we resist. American greatness, in the Trumpian sense, is antithetical to American goodness. What is best for democracy — that is, what benefits the most fortunate as well as the least fortunate — is not efficiency but empathy. Governments are not businesses because the goal should be to serve all of the people, not the monied few.
Nobody wants waste. But the touting of cost-cutting efficiencies is a canard to distract us from the unchecked kleptocracy of oligarchs and the influence of foreign princes. To repair this rot, we must engage in a vigorous campaign to restore fundamental American values of dignity, equality, and robust democracy.
I finally reached someone who agreed to come take a look at our roof. He was a young man named Brian who took a couple of days to show up, but who was cheerful and talkative when he did. He extended a ladder above our gutter and climbed up on the roof, walking about as easily as I would in my living room.
He inspected the damage with a practiced eye.
“No problem,” he declared.
The repair was made in half an hour. Brian promised to send a bill, but I never got one.
My weariness will likely continue for a while longer. But I am helped by the knowledge that I don’t have to remain standing forever. I will stand today, and after that I will stand tomorrow. For the places in which I am afraid, there are others who will stand for me. In the places in which others are afraid, I will stand for them.
Statues belong to the past and the future.
The present belongs to the living.

HIGHWAYS:

The average distance driven on I-95 in Connecticut is 11 miles.

Some 180,000 vehicles drive all or part of the 112 miles that I-95 runs through our state.  But even factoring in true interstate drivers (think Florida to Maine), the average distance driven in Connecticut is tiny.  Why?  Because we use I-95 like a local road to avoid Route 1, not just for interstate travel.

Trucks are banned from the Merritt Parkway. But in 1943 trucks were allowed on that roadway as part of the war effort.

But trucks in those days were much lower, easily clearing the bridges.
AVIATION:

The supersonic Concorde was a real gas-guzzler. In the 15 minutes from leaving the gate until takeoff, the jet burned two metric tons of Jet A gas… enough to fly a conventional jet for an hour — from Heathrow in London to Charles DeGaulle Airport in Paris.

Carrying just 100 passengers, The Concorde would burn about a ton of fuel per passenger crossing the Atlantic.

The busiest airport in the world is Atlanta’s Hartsfield International (ATL), handling 108 million passengers last year… almost 296,000 a day.

And most of them fly Delta, which hosts 165 of the airport’s 192 gates, a 86% share of the capacity. 

This is a January 21, 1976 photo of a British Airways Concorde as it makes its inaugural flight from Heathrow Airport in London.   Credit: AP Photo/Dave Caulkin
METRO-NORTH:

Did you know that a fully loaded eight-car train on Metro-North can carry over 1,000 passengers… more than double the capacity of a fully loaded 747.
The 24-mile-long Danbury branch line used to be electrified. But the wires were ripped out in 1961 to save money by running diesels. The copper was sold as scrap.
Grand Central Terminal has 67 tracks and 44 platforms, more than any station in the world.

And never call it “Grand Central Station.”  That’s the name of the post office and subway station nearby.
HIGH SPEED RAIL:

America’s only “high speed train” (Acela) can go up to 160 mph. But the average speed it runs traveling 456 miles from Washington, D.C. to Boston is just 70 mph.
China has the largest high speed network in the world covering more than 29,000 miles and carrying 4 billion passenger trips. Its trains run as fast as 260 mph.

TRANSIT FARES:

In Portland Oregon the trains don’t have “Senior” fares. Instead, Seniors, Veterans, active-duty military personnel, handicapped and low-income residents are called “Honored Citizens” and get 50 – 75% off regular fares.

SHIPPING:

The biggest container ships sailing today can carry over 24,000 containers.

But those mega-ships are too big for the Panama Canal… but not for the Suez Canal, which has no locks.

New York’s Staten Island Ferry can carry over 6,000 passengers per trip. That added up to 25 million passengers in 2019… more than double the population of Greece.

And yes, the Staten Island Ferry is free.  The old 50 cent fare was dropped in 1997 in a nod to the city’s efforts to make access to the tiny borough more affordable.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ap-chinese-rail.jpg,,,2025-05-18 05:00:52.503172

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A major elections reform bill, a priority of House and Senate leaders, is dead in the Alaska Legislature.
Wednesday is the last day of the regular legislative session, and members of the House’s multipartisan majority said on Saturday that they lack the support needed to overcome the opposition of the House’s Republican minority in the time they have left.
Bills don’t expire at the end of the first year of the two-year legislative session, but Senate Bill 64 needed to become law this year in order to be implemented in time for the 2026 election.
Among the changes in the bill: Speedier ballot counting, better tracking of absentee ballots, ballot dropboxes across the state, free return postage for absentee ballots, a liaison to help fix voting issues in rural Alaska, permanent absentee ballot registration, a method to fix paperwork problems after an absentee ballot is cast, the elimination of the requirement that a “witness” sign a voter’s absentee ballot, and additional security audits.
Many of the House’s Republicans objected to the bill, saying that they believe it did not do enough to address their concerns about election security.
The Senate passed SB 64 on Monday, but Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome and co-chair of the House Finance Committee said that House Republicans were prepared to offer so many amendments to the bill that it would have required members of the House to abandon all other work in order to push the bill across the finish line. Even then, it could have been vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican. 
With those possibilities in play, the House majority’s 14 Democrats, five independents and two Republicans met behind closed doors and decided to abandon the effort. 
“The caucus just said, ‘We’re either gonna have to set everything else aside and focus on that, and probably still won’t get it through, or we just say we’re going to have to set it aside,’” Foster said.
“We all decided as a group that … to try to do it in four days, it was not good public process. If we had two weeks, that would have been fast tracking it, and maybe we could have gotten it through,” he said.
A disproportionately large number of absentee ballots are rejected from rural Alaska in each election cycle, and Foster — in charge of scheduling bills for the House Finance Committee — said he really wanted to see SB 64 advance, but it was clear that it wasn’t possible, barring an unlikely special session.
Late Friday, as the bill’s fate became clear, the Republican minority issued a triumphant news release.
“This bill greases the skids for all mail-in elections like Anchorage has. SB 64 is the biggest hoax that the Democrats have promulgated so far this year — and that is saying a lot since there are some other bills that are contenders,” said Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, in the message. “Alaskans should be appalled. Talk about a bill that will bring out more fraud! SB 64 is the Election Fraud bill!”
Other Republican opponents were more measured.
“Rushing a nonpartisan bill through at the last minute isn’t how the legislative process is meant to work. I’m glad we’ll have the chance to take a closer look at SB 64 next year,” said Rep. Frank Tomaszewski, R-Fairbanks, in the news release.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the lead person pushing SB 64, noted that this is the third time in the past three legislative sessions that the Legislature has failed to pass a significant elections bill.
“I know there’s groups out there that are looking at ballot initiatives. Very frankly, at this point, they’re just so frustrated with the Legislature because it’s been a decade working on this bill,” he said. “So I think if we don’t get something done this year, you’re going to start seeing some people talk about just doing an initiative for the sections that they want.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)There will be no extra money for the University of Alaska’s sports teams, its effort to become a top-tier research university or its attempts to hire and keep staff.
On Friday, the legislative committee assigned to write the final version of Alaska’s state operating budget axed all of those items — and many more — from its in-progress draft.
Alaska is facing a severe budget crunch, thanks to low oil prices and reduced federal spending, and lawmakers are eliminating almost every previously considered addition, even before Gov. Mike Dunleavy gets a chance to use his veto pen.
Flat funding, combined with inflation, means cuts for most state services. The Permanent Fund dividend isn’t immune, either. It’s expected to be about $1,000 this year, the lowest figure in state history, once adjusted for inflation.
“It’s just a really challenging time, and there’s a lot of volatility, and Alaska’s heavily dependent upon federal funds,” said Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks. “We don’t have that huge buffer of oil and gas funds that we once did.”
Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, appeared resigned to the decisions when asked for comment.
“It is what it is,” he said.
Among the university’s budget cuts is $150,000 for a staff member to help the university’s efforts on diversity, equity and inclusion. The University’s Board of Regents voted earlier this year to cancel DEI efforts, including those intended to help Alaska Native students.
“We obviously are cut down to the bone if we’re talking about individual, singular positions in the budget, and the board of regents has taken a position that’s alternative to what I think the UA community broadly wants to see happen, so it puts our Legislature as an appropriating body in a really difficult position making those kinds of decisions,” said Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks.
The budget maneuvering isn’t restricted to the University of Alaska. At the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, legislators have cut road maintenance spending and have requested a report on the feasibility of turning the Dalton Highway — Alaska’s overland link to the North Slope — into a toll road.
A plan to put more Alaska state troopers in Kotzebue to fight child abuse crimes was only partially funded, and $2.3 million for additional trooper overtime was trimmed to $1 million. 
The conference committee, in charge of combining different budget drafts approved by the state House and Senate, may also cancel plans for additional state and wildlife troopers in Talkeetna.
Legislators are asking DPS to begin meeting with the Kenai, Fairbanks and Matanuska-Susitna boroughs about setting up local police in those areas in order to replace troopers.
“It is the intent of the legislature to direct public safety funds to areas of the state that do not have the tax base to provide needed policing services to their communities,” the latest budget draft states.
A few budget increases remain — $250,000 more for maintenance at the state’s trial courts, $292,000 more for security screening of legislative mail, and additional state funding for Alaska’s forestry program as part of an effort to increase logging.
For the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, the conference committee approved backstop funding for public schools in case Dunleavy vetoes House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the state’s per-student funding formula.
The backstop language includes a one-time bonus that’s slightly smaller than the increase included within HB 57. That increase is itself lower than the rate of inflation.
The committee declined to increase funding for special education, child nutrition, early education, and state libraries, archives and museums. But lawmakers did approve an increase for career and technical education initiatives.
They temporarily postponed a decision on items related to foreign teacher recruitment and training, at the request of Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage.
Those may be taken up as soon as Sunday.
The committee approved $5.5 million for child advocacy centers, which support child victims of physical and sexual abuse. That money was added after the federal government cut funding for the centers.
For the state prison system, the budget directs the closure of part of Spring Creek Correctional Center and directs the Alaska Department of Corrections to prepare a report for the Legislature evaluating which prisons would provide the most cost savings if closed. Budget negotiators also rejected increased funding for vocational training programs intended to aid Alaskans who leave the prison system. 
Several items are still being debated, and the conference committee was scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. Sunday to finalize the compromise budget draft.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)The Utah GOP’s state delegates have charted the next chapter for the state’s dominant political party — sticking with an incumbent who characterized himself as a “bridge builder” rather than a burner.
With nearly 67% turnout during their organizing convention at Utah Valley University in Orem on Saturday, 2,645 Utah Republican Party state delegates voted to reelect Rob Axson as their party chair, handing another loss to his challenger and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Phil Lyman.
Axson won with about 54% (1,430 votes), to Lyman’s nearly 46% (1,215 votes), according to the party’s election results. 
The vote settled what many delegates considered a toss-up contest — but Axson won with a healthy majority. Though Lyman and his “Make Utah Great Again” campaign was given a warm reception with loud cheers from passionate supporters, Axson was a formidable incumbent, buoyed by an endorsement from President Donald Trump about a week before the convention. 
To Axson, his victory showed delegates “want to see more” of what he’s started in the Utah Republican Party. 
“They want to see additional momentum. They want to see growth,” Axson told reporters after his win. “They’ve seen what I’ve delivered over the last two years … and that is now the new foundation. Let’s build from there.”

Axson vs. Lyman
Axson — who championed his fundraising record as chair of the party since 2023 and framed himself as a “bridge builder” rather than a burner — was also endorsed by other Utah Republican Party heavyweights, including Sen. Mike Lee and other Utahns in Congress, as well as high-ranking state leaders including House Speaker Mike Schultz, and former party chair Carson Jorgensen.
Axson or Lyman? Utah Republican delegates to elect their next leader

Lyman, on the other hand, campaigned against the “establishment,” continuing a barrage of unsubstantiated claims that he peddled during his unsuccessful bid last year against Gov. Spencer Cox that there’s “corruption” and election fraud in Utah government. 
In the end, though, delegates signaled they liked the track Axson has put the party on over the last two years, while they rejected Lyman’s pitch for a more combative — perhaps even unlawful — future GOP. 
While challenging Axson for party chair, Lyman painted himself as a leader who would position the Utah GOP to more aggressively assert its capability to select Republican nominees rather than follow SB54, a 2014 state law that allows a dual path to the primary through both the caucus and convention process and through signature gathering. 
Though Axson also agreed Utah Republicans should continue fighting SB54, he disagreed with taking Lyman’s approach, which Axson argued would amount to breaking the law. Instead, Axson said the party should focus on working with the Utah Legislature to change the law. 
During his speech, Axson told delegates that SB54 “still undermines the principles of our party.” However, he also said “the law is the law, and claiming otherwise is not a strategy for success, no matter how loudly you do so.”

“We must repeal SB54, but we cannot unless we are united,” he said. “We can’t beat SB54 if we spend all our time beating one another.”
Without naming Lyman during his speech, Axson said there’s a “clear difference between me and others: I am not willing to break the law, especially to break the law in a way that will jeopardize our Republican candidates and force them to get signatures instead of leaning into the delegate process that we all believe in.” 
Axson also touted the endorsement from Trump, along with support from members of Utah’s congressional delegation and others.
“Ultimately if we want to be successful beyond the next 20 years, if we hope to bring the next generation into the Republican Party, we must build,” he said. 
Lyman, during his speech, didn’t specifically address SB54 or specifics about his vision as party leader, but he focused on his philosophical stance for a government that “belongs to the people.”

“I wish that I lived in 1765 back in Boston,” Lyman said, adding that if he did, “I would have been a member of the Sons of Liberty,” referring to a secretive and sometimes violent political organization in the 13 American Colonies that worked to fight taxation by the British government. 
“I would have been there in 1770 when the Boston Massacre occurred, I would have been there in 1773 when the (Boston) Tea Party took place,” Lyman said. “Because those people were pushing back against the government that did not have their interests at heart. That’s what we’re about.”
Lyman said the Sons of Liberty were “called all kinds of horrible names too, including bridge burners, but they actually burned bridges to impede the direction of their enemy.” 
Lyman also issued a call to action to unite Utah Republicans, regardless of the outcome of the race for GOP chair. 
“From this point, we will be united,” he said. “I will stand behind Rob Axson. He’s a friend of mine. I love Donald Trump, he’s my president. I’ve supported him. I appreciate Sen. Lee. … I recognize their efforts, I support them.”
But Lyman concluded his speech by telling delegates “this is a time for you.” 
“This is your party. The Republican Party is yours. And today you will decide what direction this party takes,” he said, to loud cheers.

Continued angst with SB54
On full display throughout the convention was Republican delegates’ continued hatred of SB54.  Utah lawmakers passed the law more than 10 years ago as a compromise to ward off a looming ballot initiative to do away with the caucus and convention system altogether in favor of signature gathering. 
But ever since, Utah Republican Party caucus system loyalists have despised the law, even though it’s survived multiple court challenges that almost drove the Utah GOP to bankruptcy. It’s become one of the largest wedges dividing Utah Republicans, and Republicans’ strategy to continue fighting it was at the heart of the contest between Axson and Lyman. 
But if there was an early indication that most delegates weren’t in favor of taking a scorched earth approach to challenge SB54 further, one of the first votes they took Saturday morning was to strip from the agenda a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution that would temporarily revoke a Republican candidate’s party membership if they gain access to the ballot through signature gathering rather than through the caucus and convention system.

State law specifies two types of political parties: registered parties and qualified political parties. Candidates of registered parties must use signature gathering to access the ballot, while candidates of qualified parties (a designation the Utah GOP currently functions under), can either gather signatures or be nominated at convention. Utah law does not have a designation that lets parties only allow ballot access through nomination. 
If the state GOP’s proposed amendment to strip a candidate’s party membership for using a legal pathway to the ballot had passed, it would have violated state law and possibly could have led to yet another court challenge. 
The amendment’s sponsor, Arnold Gaunt, motioned to remove it from the agenda, saying “there’s a better path for responding to the problem.” 
Axson told reporters that he’s “not a fan” of SB54 and the signature gathering path, but he  focused his message on “not lawsuits, not division, not purity tests. It’s building something that can’t be ignored.” 
“If we build an apparatus that every Utahn and every community feels that there’s a value in that, well they’re going to come along with us,” Axson said. “They’re going to be supportive of what we’re trying to do, and the Legislature is going to listen to that.”

Axson said his preference would be for the Legislature to repeal SB54. Pressed on whether that’s a real possibility, he told reporters “the votes are there in the House” while they’re “not there yet in the Senate.” 
“But it can’t be a vitriolic conversation. It’s not threats. It has to be a conversation that’s transparent and up front and collaborative,” Axson said. “If we can show the value of what the Republican Party is doing … and trying to grow and build additional capacity, we make it a lot easier on these elected officials to take the hard votes of repealing SB54.” 
However, Axson acknowledged “it’s going to take some time.” 
“How long or how short that is, I don’t know,” Axson said. “But I do know we have in our ability the opportunity to build a strong party, and that will be a benefit in repealing SB54 or solving other complex issues.” 
Axson’s influential supporters 
The morning of the convention, Axson’s predecessor, former Utah GOP Chair Carson Jorgensen, was chatting up delegates wearing an Axson button on his shirt. He said Axson is the right leader for the party, lauding him as a proven organizer and fundraiser who helped bring the party out of bankruptcy after multiple failed legal challenges of SB54. 
Jorgensen said Axson will take the right approach by focusing on working with lawmakers to strengthen the caucus-convention system rather than more lawsuits. 
Are delegates in touch with Utah voters? Survey reveals where they ‘align and diverge’

“I like Phil personally as a friend, I think he’s a nice guy,” Jorgensen said. “But here’s the thing. There are three ways we’re going to navigate SB54, and only three. One is the lawsuit route. We’ve tried it. It doesn’t work. Phil is 0 for 5 on lawsuits. The party can’t afford another lawsuit.”
Jorgensen said the next option is a “legislative fix,” which requires a “relationship with the Legislature.” 
“Sorry, but Phil has burned every — every — bridge he had with any legislator,” Jorgensen said. 
The last option, he said, is the party opts to hold its own primary. 
“What does that take? Money,” Jorgensen said. “If the party’s going to hold their own primary, they’ve got to fund it. We figure between $1.5 and $3 million to run it. Rob has shown he can raise that kind of money.” 
So Axson has “two of the three that need to happen, and Phil doesn’t have any,” Jorgensen concluded. “That’s why I support Rob.” 
Jorgensen also issued a call to Utah Republicans to set their differences aside and coalesce behind the new chair. 
 “Everybody needs to get back on the same page. This has been a pretty toxic election,” he said, adding that someone recently called him an “establishment RHINO hack.” To that, he said, “you obviously don’t know me and you’re on the wrong side of things, because you don’t find anybody more conservative than I am.” 
Utah’s SB54 still stands despite 10 years of angst. Will lawmakers change it?

Another Axson supporter seen mingling with delegates was House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, who was also acting as a delegate Saturday. He told Utah News Dispatch that he’d be voting for Axson for party chair “because we need somebody to bring all sides together.” 
“That’s what we do in the Legislature,” Schultz said. “We have to work to find common ground.”
Why not Lyman? Schultz declined to comment, focusing his remarks instead on his support of Axson. Trump’s endorsement of Axson, Schultz said, indicates Trump “has noticed something different about Utah.” 
“He has embraced Utah and sees Utah as being able to help push the agenda that he’s pushing on a nationwide level,” Schultz said. “I think that’s why you saw President Trump chime in and say, what you’re doing in Utah is working, stick with it.” 
Schultz added that Utah Republicans need to realize “if we split up our party, we lose.” 
“If the party gets split, it’s the best thing that can happen for Democrats in the state of Utah,” he said. “So finding ways to keep the party together keeps Utah Republican, it keeps Utah conservative. That’s what President Trump sees and that’s why I’m supporting Rob Axson.” 
How will Utah lawmakers tackle SB54? 
Pressed on efforts to repeal SB54, Schultz told Utah News Dispatch he and lawmakers are open to working with the Utah Republican Party to find a path forward that’s focused on strengthening the caucus and convention system — but he also warned that completely undoing SB54 could have negative consequences. 
“Count My Vote has been very open and saying that they will run a ballot initiative that does away with the caucus convention altogether,” he said. “I think that would be very harmful to the grassroots of our party.” 
Schultz added: “I love the caucus convention system because it does keep money out of politics. So I would like to look for ways to make the caucus and convention system stronger and get their people involved in the caucus and convention system.” 
“That is a good pathway forward,” he said, but he didn’t offer any specifics of what that could look like in legislative action. 
“I truly don’t know,” he said, “but I think we need to understand the consequences of (undoing SB54). We look at the polling, and it’s not even close. If it goes to ballot initiative, we lose the caucus and convention system. And I think that would be horrible. I would rather find ways to make the caucus and convention system stronger.”

The ‘MUGA’ message that resonated with many, but failed
Wearing a maroon MUGA hat in support of Lyman, Tiffany Mendenhall, of Ivins, said she was all in favor of Lyman for chair. 
Signature audit finds ‘some errors’ — but Cox still ultimately qualified for primary

“Lyman has our best interest at heart,” she said, adding that she didn’t like the outcome of the governor’s race last year and the direction the Utah GOP has been heading. “Phil is very well aware of what’s going on with all the crookedness and all of that stuff. He intends to get us back to more traditional voting methods so that there’s no fraud.” 
Though Utah’s election was certified and Cox legally qualified as a Republican candidate before he went on to win the election, Mendenhall said she believed the governor’s race was “absolutely stolen,” arguing he “didn’t have the signatures.” 
While signature gathering audits did find “some errors” and that based on statistical error rates Cox could have initially fallen short of the 28,000-signature requirement, auditors also reported that had clerks told him he hadn’t qualified (which they didn’t), he would have had 28 days more days to submit enough signatures. Ultimately, the audits concluded Cox followed the law and qualified for the primary.
Mendenhall, however, stood firm on the false claim that Lyman has repeatedly pushed throughout both his gubernatorial and Utah GOP chair campaigns — that Cox was an illegitimate candidate and “stole” the election.
“You can’t tell us that it wasn’t. And so how can we feel that we have a fair election when our governor in charge is a cheat?” Mendenhall said. She argued Axson hasn’t done enough to challenge what happened during the governor’s race. “He hasn’t stood up to take care of this. This shouldn’t have happened.”

Photo by Andrew VonBank/House Public Information Services.With just over 48 hours prior to the Legislature’s mandatory adjournment midnight Monday, lawmakers are still struggling to resolve a few key issues as they aim for a two-year budget to fund everything from roads to schools, parks, health and social services.
Several large budget bills have yet to be negotiated between the 67-67 divided House and the Democratic-controlled Senate — health and human services, education, a potential infrastructure package and a tax bill — i.e., the most complex and contentious.
The lack of movement on these bills makes a special session all the more likely. Legislative leaders say they anticipate a one-day special session prior to Memorial Day, though it could be longer.
Lawmakers have to pass a budget by June 30 or the government will shut down.
Among the major sticking points: cutting MinnesotaCare for undocumented immigrant adults. Some rank-and-file, progressive Democrats broke with their leaders and Gov. Tim Walz and protested the budget agreement over the proposal and harshly criticized Democratic leadership for acquiescing to one of the Republicans’ top priorities.
House DFL Caucus leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, appearing Friday on TPT Almanac, said Democrats will need to compromise given the divided government.
“People need to bend. They need to understand they won’t get everything they want,” Hortman said.
Rep. Cedric Frazier, DFL-New Hope, who is also co-chair of the progressive People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, told reporters Saturday that the POCI Caucus doesn’t plan to shut down the government over cutting MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults.
“We care about all the Minnesotans, and we’re not willing to shut the government down, but we’re willing to make sure we work very hard to ensure the Minnesotans get what they need,” Frazier said.
Other contentious debates include potential changes to the state’s new paid leave and earned sick and safe time programs and cuts to taxpayer aid for private schools.
Walz has proposed cutting $109 million in aid that helps private schools with transportation, counseling and textbooks. The state has allocated this funding to private schools for decades, but Walz and Democrats are proposing the cuts amid a projected multi-billion dollar budget deficit beginning in 2027.
On Thursday, House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, gave reporters the impression that private school aid would not be touched and presented this as a win for Republicans.
“We also know that we have made great strides in protecting the funding for non-public education. We are protecting our schools,” Demuth said. “We are protecting our students so they can learn in the best way forward.”
But cuts to private school aid are still in play, as far as a key DFL senator is concerned.
Sen. Mary Kunesh, DFL-New Brighton, said that funding for private school aid wasn’t part of the global budget agreement, and protecting public education is a priority for Senate Democrats.
“I understand the uniqueness and the value of non-public schools, but as the chair of the Education Finance Committee in the state of Minnesota, my priority is to fund public schools at the best rate and in the best way possible,” Kunesh said in an interview with the Reformer.
A source with the House Republican caucus told the Reformer that there’s “no scenario where we will agree to” any cuts.
Kunesh, who also serves as an assistant majority leader, said that the cuts to private schools are part of her education budget, and she anticipates this issue to be a sticking point in budget negotiations between members of the House and Senate — also known as a conference committee.
“We just have to remind those members also that we have that obligation to public schools first,” Kunesh said. 
In between the Senate and House floor sessions, Rep. Dave Baker, R-Wilmar, and Sen. Judy Seeberger, DFL-Afton, held a small press gaggle near the Capitol rotunda to tell reporters that significant changes to the state’s paid leave and earned sick and safe time programs are still on the table, despite their absence from the legislative leaders’ budget agreement.
Legislative leaders agreed to reduce the paid leave payroll tax cap that the Department of Employment and Economic Development could implement each year from 1.2% to 1.1%. But since paid leave will launch in January with a 0.88% payroll tax split between employers and workers, the reduction does nothing to change the program as currently constituted.
Baker said Demuth has given him her blessing to keep trying to implement paid leave changes in conference committee, though he didn’t say what he would specifically look to change. Throughout the session, Baker has attempted to exempt small employers from the paid leave requirement.
“We’re just trying to get (paid leave) right-sized a little bit,” Baker told reporters.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrLrAVuXkAAtEyn-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-17 19:03:33.120583

(Jackie Fortíer/KFF Health News)In the dim basement of a Salt Lake City pharmacy, hundreds of amber-colored plastic pill bottles sit stacked in rows, one man’s defensive wall in a tariff war.
Independent pharmacist Benjamin Jolley and his colleagues worry that the tariffs, aimed at bringing drug production to the United States, could instead drive companies out of business while raising prices and creating more of the drug shortages that have plagued American patients for several years.
Jolley bought six months’ worth of the most expensive large bottles, hoping to shield his business from the 10% across-the-board tariffs on imported goods that President Donald Trump announced April 2. Now with threats of additional tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals, Jolley worries that costs will soar for the medications that will fill those bottles.
In principle, Jolley said, using tariffs to push manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. makes sense. In the event of war, China could quickly stop all exports to the United States.
“I understand the rationale for tariffs. I’m not sure that we’re gonna do it the right way,” Jolley said. “And I am definitely sure that it’s going to raise the price that I pay my suppliers.”

Squeezed by insurers and middlemen, independent pharmacists such as Jolley find themselves on the front lines of a tariff storm. Nearly everyone down the line — drugmakers, pharmacies, wholesalers, and middlemen — opposes most tariffs.
Slashing drug imports could trigger widespread shortages, experts said, because of America’s dependence on Chinese- and Indian-made chemical ingredients, which form the critical building blocks of many medicines. Industry officials caution that steep tariffs on raw materials and finished pharmaceuticals could make drugs more expensive.
“Big ships don’t change course overnight,” said Robin Feldman, a UC Law San Francisco professor who writes about prescription drug issues. “Even if companies pledge to bring manufacturing home, it will take time to get them up and running. The key will be to avoid damage to industry and pain to consumers in the process.”
Trump on April 8 said he would soon announce “a major tariff on pharmaceuticals,” which have been largely tariff-free in the U.S. for 30 years.
“When they hear that, they will leave China,” he said. The U.S. imported $213 billion worth of medicines in 2024 — from China but also India, Europe, and other areas.
Trump’s statement sent drugmakers scrambling to figure out whether he was serious, and whether some tariffs would be levied more narrowly, since many parts of the U.S. drug supply chain are fragile, drug shortages are common, and upheaval at the FDA leaves questions about whether its staffing is adequate to inspect factories, where quality problems can lead to supply chain crises.
Private equity snaps up disability services, challenging state regulators

On May 12, Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to bring down the prices Americans pay for prescriptions, to put them in line with prices in other countries.
Meanwhile, pharmacists predict even the 10% tariffs Trump has demanded will hurt: Jolley said a potential increase of up to 30 cents a vial is not a king’s ransom, but it adds up when you’re a small pharmacy that fills 50,000 prescriptions a year.
“The one word that I would say right now to describe tariffs is ‘uncertainty,’” said Scott Pace, a pharmacist and owner of Kavanaugh Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas.
To weather price fluctuations, Pace stocked up on the drugs his pharmacy dispenses most.
“I’ve identified the top 200 generics in my store, and I have basically put 90 days’ worth of those on the shelf just as a starting point,” he said. “Those are the diabetes drugs, the blood pressure medicines, the antibiotics — those things that I know folks will be sicker without.”
Pace said tariffs could be the death knell for the many independent pharmacies that exist on “razor-thin margins” — unless reimbursements rise to keep up with higher costs.
Unlike other retailers, pharmacies can’t pass along such costs to patients. Their payments are set by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers largely owned by insurance conglomerates, who act as middlemen between drug manufacturers and purchasers.
Neal Smoller, who employs 15 people at his Village Apothecary in Woodstock, New York, is not optimistic.
“It’s not like they’re gonna go back and say, well, here’s your 10% bump because of the 10% tariff,” he said. “Costs are gonna go up and then the sluggish responses from the PBMs — they’re going to lead us to lose more money at a faster rate than we already are.”
Smoller, who said he has built a niche selling vitamins and supplements, fears that FDA firings will mean fewer federal inspections and safety checks.
“I worry that our pharmaceutical industry becomes like our supplement industry, where it’s the wild West,” he said.
Narrowly focused tariffs might work in some cases, said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy. For example, while drug manufacturing plants can cost $1 billion and take three to five years to set up, it would be relatively cheap to build a syringe factory — a business American manufacturers abandoned during the covid-19 pandemic because China was dumping its products here, Wosińska said.
It’s not surprising that giants such as Novartis and Eli Lilly have promised Trump they’ll invest billions in U.S. plants, she said, since much of their final drug product is made here or in Europe, where governments negotiate drug prices. The industry is using Trump’s tariff saber-rattling as leverage; in an April 11 letter, 32 drug companies demanded European governments pay them more or face an exodus to the United States.
Brandon Daniels, CEO of supply chain company Exiger, is bullish on tariffs. He thinks they could help bring some chemical manufacturing back to the U.S., which, when coupled with increased use of automation, would reduce the labor advantages of China and India.
“You’ve got real estate in North Texas that’s cheaper than real estate in Shenzhen,” he said at an economic conference April 25 in Washington, referring to a major Chinese chemical manufacturing center.

But Wosińska said no amount of tariffs will compel makers of generic drugs, responsible for 90% of U.S. prescriptions, to build new factories in the U.S. Payment structures and competition would make it economic suicide, she said.
Several U.S. generics firms have declared bankruptcy or closed U.S. factories over the past decade, said John Murphy, CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, the generics trade group. Reversing that trend won’t be easy and tariffs won’t do it, he said.
“There’s not a magic level of tariffs that magically incentivizes them to come into the U.S.,” he said. “There is no room to make a billion-dollar investment in a domestic facility if you’re going to lose money on every dose you sell in the U.S. market.”
His group has tried to explain these complexities to Trump officials, and hopes word is getting through. “We’re not PhRMA,” Murphy said, referring to the powerful trade group primarily representing makers of brand-name drugs. “I don’t have the resources to go to Mar-a-Lago to talk to the president myself.”
Many of the active ingredients in American drugs are imported. Fresenius Kabi, a German company with facilities in eight U.S. states to produce or distribute sterile injectables — vital hospital drugs for cancer and other conditions — complained in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that tariffs on these raw materials could paradoxically lead some companies to move finished product manufacturing overseas.
Fresenius Kabi also makes biosimilars, the generic forms of expensive biologic drugs such as Humira and Stelara. The United States is typically the last developed country where biosimilars appear on the market because of patent laws.
Louisiana considers ‘homelessness courts’ as housing advocates stress lack of resources

Tariffs on biosimilars coming from overseas — where Fresenius makes such drugs — would further incentivize U.S. use of more expensive brand-name biologics, the March 11 letter said. Biosimilars, which can cost a tenth of the original drug’s price, launch on average 3-4 years later in the U.S. than in Canada or Europe.
In addition to getting cheaper knockoff drugs faster, European countries also pay far less than the United States for brand-name products. Paradoxically, Murphy said, those same countries pay more for generics.
European governments tend to establish more stable contracts with makers of generics, while in the United States, “rabid competition” drives down prices to the point at which a manufacturer “maybe scrimps on product quality,” said John Barkett, a White House Domestic Policy Council member in the Biden administration.
As a result, Wosińska said, “without exemptions or other measures put in place, I really worry about tariffs causing drug shortages.”
Smoller, the New York pharmacist, doesn’t see any upside to tariffs.
“How do I solve the problem of caring for my community,” he said, “but not being subject to the emotional roller coaster that is dispensing hundreds of prescriptions a day and watching every single one of them be a loss or 12 cents profit?”

Andy Beshear says at least 14 people are dead after tornadoes, wind and hail tore across Kentucky Friday evening into Saturday morning. Beshear said he expects the death toll from the storms to rise.
The Southeastern Kentucky cities of London and Somerset appear to be especially hard hit by tornadic damage. Somerset Mayor Alan Keck declared a local state of emergency Saturday morning, and London Mayor Randall Weddle told Lexington TV station WKYT that “lives have been changed forever here tonight.” 
Beshear had declared a statewide state of emergency on Friday ahead of the “dangerous” storm system. Beshear wrote on X that five counties had declared a local state of emergency as well. 
“This is another tough morning for Kentucky after a night of deadly weather,” Beshear said in posts on X, mentioning he has spoken with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials. “The devastation from last night’s deadly weather is heartbreaking, but we are going to make sure we get the support needed to recover and rebuild together.”
Social media users on Facebook and X posted pictures of what appears to have been a significant overnight tornado in Southeastern Kentucky. South Kentucky RECC, a local electricity cooperative, stated on Facebook that its building in Somerset took a “major hit.” The London-Corbin airport in Laurel County posted on Facebook drone footage of demolished airport buildings, along with nearby homes sustaining damage as well.

Over 90,000 Kentuckians across Kentucky, from west to southeast, had lost power as of Saturday morning, according to the website PowerOutages.us that compiles power outage data. 
Beshear said in an X post the Red Cross had available space at First Baptist Church of London and that more information on other shelter space would be shared when available. 
State lawmakers from the area issued this joint statement tatement from Sen. Brandon Storm, who represents Laurel County, Sen. Rick Girdler, who represents Pulaski County, and Senate President Robert Stivers, who represents multiple southeastern Kentucky counties:
“This is one of the hardest days our communities and region have faced. Lives have been lost. Families have been shattered. Homes and businesses have been destroyed. Sadly, we expect the loss to grow as search and rescue efforts continue.
“The destruction in Laurel and Pulaski counties is overwhelming, but so is the strength of the people who call this place home. Neighbors are already showing up to help one another, and first responders continue working around the clock.
“Local and state officials are working to get immediate help to those in need. If you’re looking for a way to help, please do. Every act of kindness makes a difference.“Our hearts are heavy today, but our commitment to helping these communities rebuild is even stronger.”

Jeff Landry’s directive to link state law enforcement agencies with federal immigration enforcement is a move toward more illegal policing, a civil rights group leader says. 
Landry issued an executive order this week, which he tabbed “Operation Geaux,” that calls for state agencies to join the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 287(g) program. It’s part of a federal law approved in 1996 that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement to delegate its power to enforce federal laws to state and local police agencies.
Louisiana is one of 40 states with active 287(g) agreements with ICE. Hawaii, Delaware, Rhode Island and Vermont have no such agreements in place. California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut have banned them in their respective state laws.

Landry joined ICE officials Thursday to sign the order authorizing the agreement, which he has dubbed Operation Geaux. According to a news release from the governor’s office, it will include “enhanced screening, aggressive identification, and a massive public awareness campaign that is going to wake people up. This isn’t just talk—it’s action. And it’s happening now.”
“If you’re here illegally and you engage in criminal activity, you are going to be deported or sent to jail,” Landry said in the statement.. “Operation Geaux is the kind of historic, one-of-a-kind partnership that the Trump Administration is looking for to fulfill the President’s promises of restoring law and order! Making America Safe Again.”
Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, said in a statement Friday her group opposes Operation Geaux. 
“This blatant targeting of the immigrant population continues to exacerbate racial profiling, instill fear in communities, and put disproportionate numbers of Black and Brown people into the deportation pipeline,” Odoms said. “Moreover, the majority of agencies participating in this program have documented records of civil rights abuses, including beatings and killings.”

As of Friday, ICE had signed 571 memorandums of agreement for 287(g) programs in the 40 participating states. They include 91 Jail Enforcement Model (JEM) agreements, which indicate local detention centers will identify, process and help ICE remove non-citizens with criminal or pending criminal charges. There are 12 more JEM agreements pending, according to ICE.
Another 205 law enforcement agencies in 32 states have agreed to take part in ICE’s Warrant Service Office (WSO) program, which allows the federal agencies to train, certify and authorize state and local police to serve and execute warrants on unauthorized immigrants. There are 29 pending WSO agreements as well.
ICE has also reached Task Force Model agreements with 275 police agencies in 28 states. TFMs are described as “as a force multiplier for law enforcement agencies to enforce limited immigration authority with ICE oversight during their routine police duties,” according to the ICE website. Another 51 TFM agreements were pending as of Friday.  
The only Louisiana law enforcement agencies ICE listed as 287(g) program participants are the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Kenner Police Department. Both had reached Jail Enforcement Model agreements with the federal government. The Beauregard Parish Sheriff’s Office is listed as having a pending Task Force Model agreement.
No state law enforcement agencies in Louisiana are listed in the ICE 287(g) participant or pending records, though the Landry administration has said Louisiana State Police and the state Department of Public Safety and Corrections it falls under will join the program. The Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is also expected to sign an 287(g) agreement as well.
State Police assisted ICE with a raid at the Port of Lake Charles in March, when 11 employees of a port contractor were arrested for allegedly not having legal status to work in the U.S.
Former LDWF Secretary Madison Sheahan joined Landry when he signed his executive order. She’s now ICE deputy director, having previously worked as an aide for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the latter was governor of South Dakota.

While last year's pink salmon runs and harvests were weak, big increases are expected this year. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)After a poor showing last year, Alaska’s statewide commercial salmon harvest appears poised for a rebound, according to projections by state biologists.
This year’s total salmon harvest is expected to be more than twice as big as last year’s total, thanks primarily to stronger returns of pink salmon, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s annual statewide run forecast and commercial harvest projection. The report was released this week.
The department’s projected 2025 total harvest is 214.6 million fish, above the 2000-2023 average of 175 million fish, though well below the record 280 million salmon harvested commercially in 2013. This year’s projected total is much higher than the 103.5 million salmon harvested commercially last year.
If the harvest occurs as projected, it would be the 10th-largest on record, said Forrest Bowers, director of the department’s Division of Commercial Fisheries.
Key to the projection for this year is a much-improved outlook for pink salmon. This year’s harvest of pink salmon, also known as humpback salmon, is expected to exceed last year’s harvest by 98.2 million fish, according to the department.
Pink salmon are the most abundant and low-priced of all five Alaska salmon species. But last year’s harvest of about 40 million pink salmon was considered abysmal, even taking into account the normal pattern of weaker runs in even-numbered years.
The species has a two-year life cycle, the shortest of all Alaska salmon species, and odd-numbered years generally have bigger returns, a pattern that has become especially pronounced in about the last decade, Bowers said.
 

  The year-to-year fluctuations in statewide pink salmon trends since 1970 are shown in this graph from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s 2025 run forecast and harvest projection report. The odd-even-year contrast has become more pronounced in recent years. (Graph provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game)
 

	The department is also forecasting increases in other species: 10.8 million more sockeye, also known as red salmon; 544,000 more coho salmon, also known as silver salmon; and 876,000 more chum salmon.
But for Chinook salmon, also known as king salmon, recent returns and harvests that have been anemic are expected to be even lower this year, according to the department’s forecast.
Last year, Alaska fishermen harvested 244,000 Chinook, according to the department. This year’s harvest is expected to be only 144,000 fish.
Because of poor returns, the state has had to “severely restrict” Chinook harvests in recent years, Bowers said. This year’s projected Chinook totals also reflect obligations under the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty, he said.
The treaty aims to ensure that enough salmon return to spawning grounds to provide adequate fish for harvesters in both countries, a goal that has proved elusive.
For now, there are limited opportunities in Alaska to fish for Chinook, outside of one “directed” fishery where it is intended harvested species.
“Southeast Alaska is the only place that we have a directed Chinook salmon fishery that’s open this year,” Bowers said. Any other Chinook harvesting is done incidentally, with those fish accidentally netted by harvesters targeting other species, he said.
Chinook notwithstanding, there is another way that this year’s commercial harvest is expected to be better than last year’s harvest: The fish will not be as small, biologists believe.
Pacific salmon have been shrinking in size for decades, a trend attributed to climate change, competition for food in the ocean and other conditions. Results of that trend were apparent last year. The average size of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, the dominant source of Alaska sockeye, was only 4.53 pounds, the smallest on record.
Measured by pounds, the total commercial harvest of Alaska salmon across all species was the third lowest on record, at about 450 million.

	Last year’s slimmed-down average size of Alaska salmon was influenced by the mix of age classes in the Bristol Bay harvest, the state’s dominant source of sockeye salmon. Last year, about 80% of the returning fish were younger, having spent only two years in the ocean, according to the department.
But this year’s returning Bristol Bay salmon are expected to be older, with 63% of them coming back after three years in the ocean, Bowers said.
“As you can imagine, a 3-year ocean fish is going to be larger than a 2-year ocean fish because most of their growth occurs in the ocean,” he said “So if they have an additional year of growth in the ocean, you know, they’re going to be larger than fish that that have spent less time in the ocean.”
Beyond the well-studied Bristol Bay runs, most other salmon runs have either single age classes returning or much less detailed information about age-class distributions, Bowers said. That makes it difficult to predict fish sizes beyond those in the Bristol Bay runs, he said.
The department’s harvest projections are based on forecasts of run sizes compared to the needed levels of “escapement,” the term for fish that reach spawning grounds where they reproduce.  
Once escapement needs are subtracted from projected run sizes, the remaining sum is considered the “harvestable surplus,” which is what the department uses as projected harvest totals, Bowers said.
Whether fishers will do with the harvestable surplus is unknown, he said.
Market conditions influence fishing efforts, the department’s annual statewide forecast notes. Therefore, the numbers calculated “may not be indicative of actual harvests,” it said.

(South Dakota Searchlight photos)It may seem a little early to start wondering about who’s likely to be elected governor of South Dakota in November of 2026. However, November is not the date that’s important. Just more than a year from now, in June 2026, the Republican Party will have its primary election to decide on a gubernatorial candidate. Since Democrats are close to a nonentity in this state, it’s the GOP primary that will likely decide the next governor of South Dakota. 
It was with that timing in mind that South Dakota News Watch, in cooperation with the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota, conducted a poll of 500 registered Republican voters and asked them who they supported for governor. 
A News Watch story accompanying the poll listed some important factors for the success of the candidates: the money they can raise, their name recognition and their standing in the state’s geographic regions. What it didn’t mention was perhaps the most important factor of all: who’s the most likely to get the endorsement of President Donald Trump. 
Hold on, you might say. Why does Donald Trump care who fills the governor’s office in South Dakota? Maybe he doesn’t, but history tells us he loves to make endorsements. Already for 2026 he has offered endorsements in races elsewhere for the U.S. Senate and House, state legislative races and governorships.

The News Watch poll found Trump with a 68% favorability rating among Republicans in South Dakota, a far better rating than any of the candidates likely to run in the GOP primary. Consequently, his endorsement would carry some weight. Just as it may not be too soon to poll Republicans on their choice for the next governor, it’s not too soon to handicap which candidate might have the best shot at getting a thumbs-up from Trump. 
The highest finisher in the poll was U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson with 28% followed by Gov. Larry Rhoden with 27%, Attorney General Marty Jackley with 18%, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden with 4% and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen with 2%. Hansen is the only one so far to announce that he’s running for the nomination, though there is plenty of speculation about the intentions of the others. 
Johnson, the marginal leader in the poll, also finds himself in the closest proximity to the White House. During Trump’s second term he has embraced the president’s policies, going so far as to introduce legislation that would allow Trump to purchase the Panama Canal. He’s even praised the government-cutting efforts of Elon Musk’s DOGE, while admitting that the whole thing could be handled better. 
Rhoden, like Johnson, has been full of praise for the president’s policies. Rhoden’s connection to Kristi Noem, his predecessor and Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security, may be valuable if the president chooses to endorse. However, you never know when the mercurial Trump may wake up angry. He went through three Homeland Security secretaries in his first term. While he has been supportive of the president, Rhoden has a long history in South Dakota politics that may be tainted by the current GOP philosophy that scorns bipartisanship. 
Jackley has to wonder what a life in public service has been worth politically, garnering just 18% support in the poll. Serving as attorney general twice and running for governor once before has to be worth more than that. Jackley, too, has ingratiated himself to Trump, going so far as to visit Mar-a-Lago to consult with the president-elect on the politicization of the Justice Department. Known for his law and order stance in South Dakota, it must be galling for Jackley to consider the blanket pardons Trump handed out to the Jan. 6 insurrectionists.

At the bottom of the poll is the only official candidate, state Rep. Jon Hansen of Dell Rapids. His low finish in the poll is an indication that hard work in the Legislature doesn’t necessarily result in name recognition within the party. Fortunately for Hansen, he has another legislative session as speaker of the House in which to make his mark. A leader in the state’s anti-abortion and property rights efforts, he’ll need to drum up a Trumpian issue to keep his name in the news and enhance his chances of getting an endorsement.
Finishing ahead of Hansen in the poll was Doeden. He’s never held elective office but his influence can be felt in the Legislature. His Dakota First Action PAC helped elect a number of populist Republican candidates who had to notch primary wins against incumbents to get to Pierre. Doeden is known for his prolific videos that often point out what’s wrong with the members of his own party. He has something brewing, announcing an event for May 28. 
Of all these candidates, Doeden is the most Trump-like with his wealth and his disdain for the status quo. He now has a cadre of lawmakers beholden to his generosity who can carry his message to far-right members of the party. That wing of the party is known for getting out the vote during primaries.

(Tony Leys/KFF Health News)SPENCER, Iowa — This town’s hospital is a holdout on behalf of people going through mental health crises. The facility’s leaders have pledged not to shutter their inpatient psychiatric unit, as dozens of other U.S. hospitals have.
Keeping that promise could soon get tougher if Congress slashes Medicaid funding. The joint federal-state health program covers an unusually large share of mental health patients, and hospital industry leaders say spending cuts could accelerate a decades-long wave of psychiatric unit closures.
At least eight other Iowa hospitals have stopped offering inpatient mental health care since 2007, forcing people in crisis to seek help in distant facilities. Spencer Hospital is one of the smallest in Iowa still offering the service.
CEO Brenda Tiefenthaler said 40% of her hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are covered by Medicaid, compared with about 12% of all inpatients. An additional 10% of the hospital’s psychiatric inpatients are uninsured. National experts say such disparities are common.
Tiefenthaler vows to keep her nonprofit hospital’s 14-bed psychiatric unit open, even though it loses $2 million per year. That’s a significant loss for an organization with an overall annual budget of about $120 million. But the people who use the psychiatric unit need medical care, “just like people who have chest pains,” Tiefenthaler said.
Medicaid covers health care for about 72 million Americans with low incomes or disabilities. Tiefenthaler predicts that if some of them are kicked off the program and left without insurance coverage, more people would delay treatment for mental health problems until their lives spin out of control.
“Then they’re going to enter through the emergency room when they’re in a crisis,” she said. “That’s not really a solution to what we have going on in our country.”
Republican congressional leaders have vowed to protect Medicaid for people who need it, but they also have called for billions of dollars in cuts to areas of the federal budget that include the program.
The U.S. already faces a deep shortage of inpatient mental health services, many of which were reduced or eliminated by private hospitals and public institutions, said Jennifer Snow, director of government relations and policy for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At the same time, the number of people experiencing mental problems has climbed.
“I don’t even want to think about how much worse it could get,” she said.
The American Hospital Association estimates nearly 100 U.S. hospitals have shuttered their inpatient mental health services in the past decade.
Such closures are often attributed to mental health services being more likely to lose money than many other types of health care.
“I’m not blaming the hospitals,” Snow said. “They need to keep their doors open.”
Medicaid generally pays hospitals lower rates for services than they receive from private insurance or from Medicare, the federal program that mostly covers people 65 or older. And Medicaid recipients are particularly likely to need mental health care. More than a third of nonelderly Medicaid enrollees have some sort of mental illness, according to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization that includes KFF Health News. Iowa has the highest rate of mental illness among nonelderly Medicaid recipients, at 51%.
As of February, just 20 of Iowa’s 116 community hospitals had inpatient psychiatric units, according to a state registry. Iowa also has four freestanding mental hospitals, including two run by the state.
Iowa, with 3.2 million residents, has a total of about 760 inpatient mental health beds that are staffed to care for patients, the state reports. The Treatment Advocacy Center, a national group seeking improved mental health care, says the “absolute minimum” of such beds would translate to about 960 for Iowa’s population, and the optimal number would be about 1,920.
Most of Iowa’s psychiatric beds are in metro areas, and it can take several days for a slot to come open. In the meantime, patients routinely wait in emergency departments.
Sheriff’s deputies often are assigned to transport patients to available facilities when treatment is court-ordered.
“It’s not uncommon for us to drive five or six hours,” said Clay County Sheriff Chris Raveling, whose northwestern Iowa county includes Spencer, a city of 11,000 people.
He said Spencer Hospital’s mental health unit often is too full to accept new patients and, like many such facilities, it declines to take patients who are violent or charged with crimes.
The result is that people are held in jail on minor charges stemming from their mental illnesses or addictions, the sheriff said.
“They really shouldn’t be in jail,” he said. “Did they commit a crime? Yes. But I don’t think they did it on purpose.”
Raveling said authorities in many cases decide to hold people in jail so they don’t hurt themselves or others while awaiting treatment. He has seen the problems worsen in his 25 years in law enforcement.
Most people with mental health issues can be treated as outpatients, but many of those services also depend heavily on Medicaid and could be vulnerable to budget cuts.
Jon Ulven, a psychologist who practices in Moorhead, Minnesota, and neighboring Fargo, North Dakota, said he’s particularly worried about patients who develop psychosis, which often begins in the teenage years or early adulthood. If they’re started right away on medication and therapy, “we can have a dramatic influence on that person for the rest of their life,” he said. But if treatment is delayed, their symptoms often become harder to reverse.
Ulven, who helps oversee mental health services in his region for the multistate Sanford Health system, said he’s also concerned about people with other mental health challenges, including depression. He noted a study published in 2022 that showed suicide rates rose faster in states that declined to expand their Medicaid programs than in states that agreed to expand their programs to cover more low-income adults. If Medicaid rolls are reduced again, he said, more people would be uninsured and fewer services would be available. That could lead to more suicides.
Nationally, Medicaid covered nearly 41% of psychiatric inpatients cared for in 2024 by a sample of 680 hospitals, according to an analysis done for KFF Health News by the financial consulting company Strata. In contrast, just 13% of inpatients in those hospitals’ cancer programs and 9% of inpatients in their cardiac programs were covered by Medicaid.
If Medicaid participants have mental crises after losing their coverage, hospitals or clinics would have to treat many of them for little or no payment.
“These are not wealthy people. They don’t have a lot of assets,” said Steve Wasson, Strata’s chief data and intelligence officer. Even though Medicaid pays hospitals relatively low rates, he said, “it’s better than nothing.”
Birthing units, which also have been plagued by closures, face similar challenges. In the Strata sample, 37% of those units’ patients were on Medicaid in 2024.
Spencer Hospital, which has a total of 63 inpatient beds, has maintained both its birthing unit and its psychiatric unit, and its leaders plan to keep them open. Amid a critical shortage of mental health professionals, it employs two psychiatric nurse practitioners and two psychiatrists, including one providing care via video from North Carolina.
Local resident David Jacobsen appreciates the hospital’s efforts to preserve services. His son Alex was assisted by the facility’s mental health professionals during years of struggles before he died by suicide in 2020.
David Jacobsen knows how reliant such services are on Medicaid, and he worries that more hospitals will curtail mental health offerings if national leaders cut the program.
“They’re hurting the people who need help the most,” he said.
People on Medicaid aren’t the only ones affected when hospitals reduce services or close treatment units. Everyone in the community loses access to care.

(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”

For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.

Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”

David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.











States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

(U.S. Department of Agriculture)Kirk Pearson, a former longtime Washington state lawmaker, was appointed this month as a top Washington official in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Pearson, a Republican, resigned from the Legislature in 2017 to take the same role as Washington’s rural development director in the first Trump administration.
He couldn’t be reached for an interview. A spokesperson for the USDA said via email that the “Office of Communications is not approving individual media interviews while they coordinate messaging during this transition period.”
“I look forward to working closely with local leaders, Native American Tribes, farmers, small businesses, and families to expand opportunity and deliver the resources they need to thrive,” Pearson said in a press release. “Our mission is clear: to support rural America with solutions that are locally driven and nationally backed.”
Pearson, of Monroe, represented the 39th Legislative District in Snohomish, Skagit and King counties. He was in the House for a dozen years before serving from 2013 to 2017 in the state Senate. At the time, his departure briefly left a 24-24 balance of power in the chamber.
Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, later replaced Pearson in the Legislature.
Before his resignation, Pearson chaired the Senate Natural Resources and Parks Committee and also served on the Agriculture, Water, Trade and Economic Development Committee.
Between his stints at USDA, he was the vice president of external affairs for the Volunteers of America Western Washington.
Pearson was one of many new state rural development directors that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins appointed this month.
“When America’s farming communities prosper, the entire nation thrives,” Rollins said in the release. “This new group of USDA appointees will ensure President Trump’s America First agenda is a reality in rural areas across the country. I am grateful for the leadership of these new state directors and look forward to their work reorienting the agency to put Farmers First again.”
Rollins also reappointed Jon Wyss as the Washington state executive director of the Farm Service Agency. President Donald Trump first tapped Wyss for the role in 2019. Then-President Joe Biden also picked him in 2022.
In a statement, U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, said “Washington farmers are lucky to have him charting the course at FSA.”
Wyss ran unsuccessfully for state Senate in 2016 in central Washington’s 12th Legislative District, losing to a fellow Republican. Over a decade earlier, he served in the Senate for a few days while the sitting senator had to briefly leave his duties.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WA_Kirk_Pearson_Oath_002_050525-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-17 09:02:00.449643

She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.

With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.
The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
Legislation and pilot programs
A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
Potential savings
In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

Court hearing is scheduled to open Tuesday in a case over a trail infraction that captured international attention.  
The post Grand Teton ultra-runner to fight switchback-cutting charges in Jackson trial appeared first on WyoFile .","The trail runner ticketed by Grand Teton National Park rangers for cutting a switchback during his fastest-ever out-and-back climb of the Grand Teton heads to court Tuesday to challenge the charges in a bench trial. 
It is the latest fallout over Michelino Sunseri’s decision to follow what he said is an oft-used and recognized route during his descent of the iconic peak. 
The ultra-runner and Jackson bartender rose to infamy in the outdoor world last fall in a dizzying sequence of events. On Sept. 2, Sunseri ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles from the Lupine Meadows parking lot to the summit of the 13,775-foot Grand Teton and back with a time of 2:50:50 — a stunning feat that broke a 12-year-old record. 
But on his way down the mountain, he cut a switchback while following the route of other previous record holders. Fastest Known Time — the organization that arbitrates and tracks official speed attempts — rejected his submission due to the offense. Not long after, national park rangers issued him a citation.

Pictures of Michelino Sunseri posted on a change.org petition pleading for authorities to drop the charges against the athlete. (Screengrab) 
Rangers gave Sunseri a ticket for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation comes with a penalty of $5,000 and/or up to six months in jail. 
When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor guilty plea, five-year ban from the national park and fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges.
The bench trial is scheduled to take place in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson. The high-elevation incident has stirred a lot of debate about appropriate behavior for trail users and appropriate penalties for infractions, and the trial is expected to be closely watched. 
Made an example?
Sunseri, an elite athlete with several record-breaking backcountry feats to his name, trained intensely through the summer with the goal of breaking the speed record that ultra-runner Andy Anderson set in 2012. North Face-sponsored Sunseri had done much preparation, including assembling a small team of photographers to film the attempt. 
Late-August snow complicated his weather window, and Sunseri set out on Labor Day, a federal holiday that can see crowded trails conditions not ideal for a speed attempt. After racing up the peak, he was behind Anderson’s pace and cut a switchback on the way down to avoid a line of hikers. Anderson, an off-duty climbing ranger at the time of his 2012 record, did not use the shortcut. 
Sunseri was open about his decision to cut the switchback in a post he wrote on the personal speed-tracking website Strava, adding that “if I had to make this choice again, I would 100% make the exact same choice.” 
The choice drew disapproval from some fellow runners and outdoor recreation figures, however, and was the reason FKT cited when it declined to recognize Sunseri’s record. 
FKT didn’t add Sunseri’s name to the top of its Grand Teton page, but it did update the page after his climb with a new bold-faced note: “The National Park Service has emphasized that cutting switchbacks on this route is a violation of the park service regulation 36 CFR 2.1(b) … Any future attempts to cut switchbacks will result in complete rejection, and the NPS intends to pursue criminal charges against athletes who engage in this behavior.”
Not long after that, in October, park rangers cited Sunseri with a federal misdemeanor. 
“Shortcutting a switchback along a trail is prohibited in the park because it causes resource impacts, like trampling vegetation, creating erosion and worsening trail conditions,” Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis told WyoFile.

Sunseri and his defenders were quick to point to the routes of previous record holders Kílian Jornet and Jen Day Denton, both recognized by FKT. “My route retraced their exact steps for what I knew to be an accepted course to achieve a new speed record,” Sunseri said in a September statement emailed to WyoFile. There are also more blatant examples of off-trail travel for which the park doesn’t have such a heavy hand, supporters say. 
Those supporters have created stickers, t-shirts and music videos under the label #freemichelino as well as a change.org petition with more than 2,000 signatures. The plea bargain offered to Sunseri is unreasonable, according to the petition’s web page. 
As a professional mountain runner, a five-year ban would force Sunseri to move away from a place where he makes his living, they argue. “To him, the six months in jail threatened by the GTNP Spokesperson is more palatable, though entirely unacceptable,” the page reads, adding that “a misdemeanor on his record carries a variety of collateral consequences, impacting employment, housing and international travel.”
Sunseri’s team cited insufficient evidence of a valid closure, selective enforcement, inadequate notice and unconstitutional delegation of legislative power when it asked for charges to be dismissed, according to court documents, 
Sunseri’s lawyers also asked for a jury trial, in which a panel of his peers would have determined the outcome. However, that request was not granted and instead, Judge Stephanie Hambrick will preside over a bench trial in which she will make the determination. 
A message to users 
While Sunseri supporters have framed the situation as a high-profile opportunity to make an example of someone, others consider it a high-profile opportunity to positively influence the public. 
David Gonzales, a writer, filmmaker and creator of the Jackson-based triathlon known as the Picnic, made a video analysis of the situation he posted on Instagram.

Sunseri took the shortcut knowing the park service had closed off the route, Gonzales said. Before the speed attempt, Sunseri “did a lap on the ground with Andy Anderson, and they didn’t use the shortcut, so it seems like he was aware of the park’s rules.”
Instead, Gonzales said, evidence seems to show Sunseri’s route decision was premeditated with full knowledge of the closure. 
“It does seem insane that Michelino could go to jail for taking a shortcut that hundreds, if not thousands of people have taken before him, but the park could very well make an example of him,” Gonzales said, adding that future users should heed a simple message. 
“So this summer in Grand Teton National Park, don’t take the shortcut,” Gonzales said.

Mayor Mike Duggan is preparing to leave office after 11 years at the end of 2025. The city’s next leader will inherit not only a revitalizing downtown but also neighborhoods like Belmont, Petosky-Otsego and Van Steuban that are grappling with housing instability and decades of neglect and disinvestment.
My research on housing insecurity, homelessness and urban governance, along with broader scholarship on equitable development, suggests that Detroit’s future depends on more than marquee developments like the Michigan Central Station Development. It depends on strengthening neighborhoods from the ground up. 
Here are three strategies that could help Detroit’s next mayor build a just and resilient city by focusing on transitional neighborhoods:
 Stabilize housing and prevent displacement

Stable housing is the foundation of thriving communities.
Yet, housing instability in Detroit is both widespread and deeply entrenched. Before the pandemic, roughly 13% of Detroiters, or about 88,000 people, had been evicted or forced to move within the previous year. Families with children faced the highest risk.
Many Detroiters had little choice but to remain in deteriorating housing, crowd into shared living arrangements or relocate elsewhere because of an estimated shortfall of 24,000 habitable housing units.
While building more housing is essential, preventing displacement requires more than new construction. It also demands policies that preserve affordability and protect tenants. Researchers have found that household stabilization policies, such as legal representation in eviction court, rent control and property tax relief, have the most immediate impact.
In Detroit, addressing the wave of expiring Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, units remains an urgent priority. When units reach the end of their compliance period in this federal program, typically 15 years, owners are no longer required to maintain affordable rents and can raise prices. This “conversion to market rate” often results in the loss of affordable housing for low-income residents.
In response to a projected loss of 10,000 units by 2023, Detroit launched the Preservation Partnership that secured affordability commitments for about 4,000 units. However, it remains difficult to determine exactly how many of the at-risk units were ultimately lost, and when, due to reporting lags, inconsistencies and overlapping affordability programs.
Despite the city’s efforts, a 2023 analysis found that a substantial affordability gap persists, with many households unable to comfortably afford market-rate housing without spending more than 30% of their income, which is the standard set by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for affordability.
The Michigan State Housing Development Authority continues to support affordable housing through tax credit allocations. However, a growing number of LIHTC properties in areas experiencing redevelopment are reaching the end of their affordability periods, putting them at risk of converting to market rate. National estimates suggest that nearly 350,000 units could lose affordability by 2030 and over 1 million by 2040 without sustained local and regional preservation efforts.
Stabilizing Detroit’s housing market means ensuring that those who stayed during the hardest times are not pushed out as reinvestment takes hold. To achieve this, the next mayor could expand rental assistance and support tenant organizing efforts. This is particularly needed in transitional neighborhoods where renters come together to fight unfair evictions, improve housing conditions and push for more stable rents.
 Reclaim and reimagine vacant land for community benefit

Many view Detroit’s vast tracks of vacant land, estimated in the hundreds of thousands of parcels, as blight. But they could also be seen as a public asset and a generational opportunity if brought together with the right public strategies.
Land trusts can turn empty lots into valuable neighborhood spaces. A land trust is a nonprofit that holds land for the community and keeps housing affordable over the long term, a key to preventing displacement.
Research also shows that greening strategies can improve community health, cohesion and equity. Cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland have launched urban greening initiatives that transform vacant lots into community gardens, small parks and tree-filled spaces. Research shows that these projects can help stabilize property values and strengthen neighborhoods by reducing blight, encouraging investment and creating safer, more attractive environments.
Detroit has a land bank, a public agency that manages vacant and foreclosed properties. The city has also invested in some green infrastructure. But experts say that these efforts require stronger city leadership, teamwork across departments and real input from residents. These are areas where Detroit still has room to grow.
By collaborating with residents to cocreate a land use vision, the next mayor could prioritize community ownership and ecological restoration instead of speculative redevelopment.
 Invest in social infrastructure

Neighborhood strength is about more than buildings — it’s about people.
As the Brookings Institution notes, economic opportunity is key to long-term safety, and investing in youth is a proven violence reduction strategy.
Detroit’s neighborhoods have long faced a lack of investment in schools, recreation centers and social services. This leaves families vulnerable and fuels cycles of poverty and criminalization. Under these conditions, young people, especially Black and brown youth, are more likely to be policed, punished and pushed into the criminal justice system.
A 2021 study found that the Detroit Public Schools Community District reported 2% of its students experienced homelessness, despite 16% of households with children reporting recent eviction or forced moves. This gap reveals major service and awareness gaps. And when families fall through those gaps, it’s often children who suffer the most.
Addressing these gaps requires investing in mental health services, youth development programs and violence prevention, rather than relying solely on policing or incarceration. These approaches recognize that true public safety comes from access to stable jobs, quality education and supportive services that meet people’s health, housing and social needs. Some of the most effective strategies include restorative justice in schools and outreach to older adults and residents experiencing homelessness.
These are not luxuries. They are essential infrastructure for neighborhood vitality.
 The work ahead

Detroit is often held up as a cautionary tale of urban decline, or more recently, as a comeback story driven by downtown revitalization. But in my opinion, its true test lies in what comes next: whether the city can translate momentum into equity for the communities that have long been left behind.
The next mayor has the chance to shift the narrative by centering housing justice, reclaiming land for public good and investing in the people who make Detroit a city worth fighting for.

People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.

Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, National Disability Rights Network attorney


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)Maine’s reproductive health providers are raising alarm about the thousands of patients that would be left without care if a proposal to cut off Medicaid funding from family planning providers comes to pass.
The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, which oversees health care, approved a massive tax cut and spending bill this week, which proposes the largest cuts to Medicaid in the history of the program, and would leave more than 8 million Americans without coverage. But a part of the bill also proposes cutting off funding to any  nonprofit health care providers that offer abortions and receive more than $1 million in Medicaid funding. 
That means two of Maine’s largest family planning service providers, both of whom serve a large number of patients on MaineCare — the state’s Medicaid program — may no longer be reimbursed by the federal government for services. 
Both Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning have policies to serve patients regardless of their ability to pay, meaning they would still commit to providing services for patients, they said. 
Medicaid reimbursements are already lower than what providers receive from private insurance, which means many Maine centers, particularly those in rural areas, are already facing significant deficits. With the likely loss of a major funding stream, these providers are now confronting a fiscal cliff, according to Olivia Pennington, director of advocacy and community engagement for Maine Family Planning, the largest network providing a wide range of services including abortions across 18 centers in Maine.

“This is a clear attack on rural Mainers, on working class Mainers. Folks who otherwise may not be able to access the health centers if their local family planning clinic has to close its doors,” Pennington said.
Already, some rural health centers in Rumford, Damariscotta and Dexter can only stay open once or twice a week because of the persistent deficits these centers have been facing, she said. The targeted exclusion from Medicaid funding, which 47% of all Maine Family Planning patients used last year, further jeopardizes the services they can provide, she said.
The bill “segregates abortion providers, and cuts folks off from making us their provider of choice,” said Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for the Maine Planned Parenthood centers.
“There’s an intention to destabilize our funding streams, such that we aren’t able to fulfill our core mission, and really put us out of business,” she said.
The centers’ ability to use Medicaid or Title X, a federal grant that supports family planning services for low-income individuals, is already restricted by the Hyde Amendment, a provision prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortions that President Donald Trump reinstated at the start of his second term. 
Maine Family Planning has been subject to regular audits to make sure Medicaid funding is not used for abortion, Pennington said.
It is not clear how Maine’s congressional delegation is going to vote on the proposed health care cuts, but during a press conference Friday Planned Parenthood of Northern New England CEO Nicole Clegg said the organization expects them to reject the proposal.
“Based on their long-standing records of opposing defunding efforts of Planned Parenthood and restrictions to reproductive health providers, our expectation is that they would not support any of these proposals moving forward,” she said. 
In light of the proposed cuts, the providers are hoping the Maine Legislature can help fill the funding gap. They highlighted LD 143, a bill that would provide $6 million a year for family planning services, including routine gynecological exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, cancer screenings, and gender-affirming and behavioral health care. 
“We really see LD 143 as essential for weathering the national storm, sort of weatherproofing our family planning care network in the midst of these potential federal defunds,” Marguiles said. “It’s really critical that the state partners with us in providing care to anyone who needs it.”
Both the Maine House and Senate cast initial votes to pass the legislation, but it was placed on the appropriations table where it will compete with many other funding needs for whatever is available as the state faces a substantial budget deficit.

(Catherine McQueen/Moment via Getty Images)In today’s digital world, people routinely turn to the internet for health or medical information. In addition to actively searching online, they often come across health-related information on social media or receive it through emails or messages from family or friends.
It can be tempting to share such messages with loved ones — often with the best of intentions.
As a global health communication scholar studying the effects of media on health and development, I explore artistic and creative ways to make health information more engaging and accessible, empowering people to make informed decisions.
Although there is a fire hose of health-related content online, not all of it is factual. In fact, much of it is inaccurate or misleading, raising a serious health communication problem: Fake health information — whether shared unknowingly and innocently, or deliberately to mislead or cause harm — can be far more captivating than accurate information.
This makes it difficult for people to know which sources to trust and which content is worthy of sharing.
 
The allure of fakery
Fake health information can take many forms. For example, it may be misleading content that distorts facts to frame an issue or individual in a certain context. Or it may be based on false connections, where headlines, visuals or captions don’t align with the content. Despite this variation, such content often shares a few common characteristics that make it seem believable and more shareable than facts.
For one thing, fake health information often appears to be true because it mixes a grain of truth with misleading claims.
For example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, false rumors suggested that drinking ethanol or bleach could protect people from the virus. While ethanol or bleach can indeed kill viruses on surfaces such as countertops, it is extremely dangerous when it comes into contact with skin or gets inside the body.
Another marker of fake health information is that it presents ideas that are simply too good to be true. There is something appealingly counterintuitive in certain types of fake health information that can make people feel they have access to valuable or exclusive knowledge that others may not know. For example, a claim such as “chocolate helps you lose weight” can be especially appealing because it offers a sense of permission to indulge and taps into a simple, feel-good solution to a complex problem. Such information often spreads faster because it sounds both surprising and hopeful, validating what some people want to believe.
Sensationalism also drives the spread of fake health information. For instance, when critics falsely claimed that Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the chief medical adviser to the president at the time, was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, it generated a lot of public attention.
In a study on vaccine hesitancy published in 2020, my colleagues and I found that controversial headlines in news reports that go viral before national vaccination campaigns can discourage parents from getting their children vaccinated. These headlines seem to reveal sensational and secret information that can falsely boost the message’s credibility.
 
The pull to share
The internet has created fertile ground for spreading fake health information. Professional-looking websites and social media posts with misleading headlines can lure people into clicking or quickly sharing, which drives more and more readers to the falsehood. People tend to share information they believe is relevant to them or their social circles.
In 2019, an article with the false headline “Ginger is 10,000x more effective at killing cancer than chemo” was shared more than 800,000 times on Facebook. The article contained several factors that make people feel an urgency to react and share without checking the facts: compelling visuals, emotional stories, misleading graphs, quotes from experts with omitted context and outdated content that is recirculated.
Visual cues like the logos of reputable organizations or photos of people wearing white medical coats add credibility to these posts. This kind of content is highly shareable, often reaching far more people than scientifically accurate studies that may lack eye-catching headlines or visuals, easy-to-understand words or dramatic storylines.
But sharing content without verifying it first has real-world consequences. For example, studies have found that COVID-19-related fake information reduces people’s trust in the government and in health care systems, making people less likely to use or seek out health services.
Unfounded claims about vaccine side effects have led to reduced vaccination rates globally, fueling the return of dangerous diseases, including measles.

Social media misinformation, such as false claims about cinnamon being a treatment for cancer, has caused hospitalizations and even deaths. The spread of health misinformation has reduced cooperation with important prevention and treatment recommendations, prompting a growing need for medical professionals to receive proper training and develop skills to effectively debunk fake health information.
 
How to combat the spread
In today’s era of information overload, when anyone can create and share content, being able to distinguish between credible and misleading health information before sharing is more important than ever. Researchers and public health organizations have outlined several strategies to help people make better-informed decisions.
Whether health care consumers come across health information on social media, in an email or through a messaging app, here are three reliable ways to verify its accuracy and credibility before sharing:

Use a search engine to cross-check health claims. Never rely on a single source. Instead, enter the health claim into a reputable search engine like Google and see what trusted sources have to say. Prioritize information from established organizations like the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United Nations Children’s Fund or peer-reviewed journals like The Lancet or Journal of the American Medical Association. If multiple reputable sources agree, the information is more likely to be reliable. Reliable fact-checking websites such as FactCheck.org and Snopes can also help root out fake information.
Evaluate the source’s credibility. A quick way to assess a website’s trustworthiness is to check its “About Us” page. This section usually explains who is behind the content, their mission and their credentials. Also, search the name of the author. Do they have recognized expertise or affiliations with credible institutions? Reliable websites often have domains ending in .gov or .edu, indicating government or educational institutions. Finally, check the publication date. Information on the internet keeps circulating for years and may not be the most accurate or relevant in the present context.
If you’re still unsure, don’t share. If you’re still uncertain about the accuracy of a claim, it’s better to keep it to yourself. Forwarding unverified information can unintentionally contribute to the spread of misinformation and potentially cause harm, especially when it comes to health.

Questioning dubious claims and sharing only verified information not only protects against unsafe behaviors and panic, but it also helps curb the spread of fake health information. At a time when misinformation can spread faster than a virus, taking a moment to pause and fact-check can make a big difference.

Wes Moore (D) inspects damage at a library in Westernport on Thursday in the wake of flooding in Western Maryland in the previous week. (Photo by Patrick Siebert/Governor's office)The Allegany County Department of Emergency Services announced that a multiagency resource center would open Saturday in Westernport to help residents of the flood-damaged area find the help they need to recover from the week’s storms.
The resource center will alternate daily between Westernport and Lonaconing for the next week, offering walk-in help with food stamps and other benefits, senior services, health care, disaster relief, community referrals and other services.
The center opening comes two days after Gov. Wes Moore (D) declared a state of emergency Thursday for Allegany and Garrett counties in the wake of the sudden heavy rains earlier this week that flooded roads, inundated homes and schools, and damaged utilities.
More than 5 inches of rain fell Tuesday, causing flooding in the state’s two westernmost counties and pushing Georges Creek to its second-highest levels on record. Georges Creek rose more than 6 feet in 5.5 hours Tuesday, to 12 feet, while the North Branch of the Potomac River near Cumberland surged almost 15 feet from Tuesday afternoon to early Wednesday, reaching flood stage of 23 feet around midnight, according to the Allegany County Department of Emergency Services.
Some roads were washed out or buried and water service the town of Lonaconing was briefly suspended after a roadway washout caused pipe damage.
More than 200 students and faculty were trapped by rising waters and had to be rescued from the Westernport and George’s Creek elementary schools by area swiftwater rescue teams Tuesday afternoon and evening.

Kati Kenney, communications director for Allegany County, told WTOP radio that the focus on Tuesday, after rescues, was on damage assessment and assuring the safety of residents in the community. She said the town of Westernport was hit hardest.
“The majority, if not all of those structures, have severe water damage and the crews there are now doing some structural assessments to figure out if they’re even safe to go back in,” Kenney said, referring to damage along the town’s Main Street.
Kenney said severe flooding is not frequent, but has happened in the past, with the most recent damaging floods occurring in 1996. “So this isn’t a first for them, but it’s been quite a few years since we’ve experienced anything quite like this,” she said.
Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th), who toured the region Thursday with Moore and other state and local officials, said that “seeing the aftermath of the flooding firsthand is overwhelming.”
“You don’t fully grasp the scale of it until you’re standing here, witnessing it for yourself,” Delaney said. “We’ve met families who had to evacuate their homes and small business owners now facing tough choices.”
Moore and Delaney were joined by Maryland secretaries of Emergency Management, Transportation and Environment, the deputy secretary of Natural Resources Police, Maryland State Police officials, Allegany County Commission President Dave Caporale and Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton.
After a briefing, the delegation toured the Westernport Main Street corridor and surveyed flood damage at Westernport fire hall, library, local businesses and Westernport Elementary School. Moore issued the emergency declaration during his tour.
“This was a serious test for public safety and health, and we responded with urgency,” Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain said after the tour. “Drinking water systems were damaged, homes were flooded, and families were impacted. We acted quickly to confirm that our dams were operating correctly, offer emergency help for contaminated home heating oil tanks, and support safe debris removal.”
McIlwain said the focus now is on “long-term recovery, guiding infrastructure repairs, fast-tracking permits, and staying close to communities as they rebuild.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)They share a Metro line, they share a ZIP code and they share a dream of revitalized older communities. And, come Saturday, the Prince George’s County towns of Capitol Heights and Fairmount Heights and the city of Seat Pleasant will have something else in common.
They will all be members of the new 20743 Coalition.
The mayors of those three inside-the-Beltway municipalities will meet Saturday to launch the coalition, named for the ZIP code they have in common. Their goal is to ensure that their often-overlooked communities share in the Blue Line corridor redevelopment projects that are scheduled in coming years as part of an effort to redevelop central Prince George’s County.
Saturday’s signing ceremony is meant as a show of unity for the communities clustered along Metro’s Blue Line and the county’s Central Avenue. All three mayors already signed a memorandum of understanding in March for each municipality to share resources “that promote economic development, enhance public services, and improve residents’ quality of life.”
The Maryland Stadium Authority is slated tom invest $400 million toward five projects planned for areas near Largo Town Center, Morgan Boulevard, Addison/Seat Pleasant and Capitol Heights Metro stations. The first will be a civic plaza by the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo, scheduled for completion in December.
One official who plans to be in attendance at the Fairmount Heights Municipal Building for Saturday’s event will be At-Large County Councilmember Jolene Ivey (D).
“I think it’s really important that we’re all on one accord when it comes to using this as an opportunity for economic development and to really push getting good things happening in that part of the county,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “We all have to kind of agree on what that looks like.”

Officials and residents from the three municipalities located inside the Beltway have said for years there has been a lack of economic development, especially when it comes to healthy food choices.
A food desert was created in July 2016, when a Safeway closed at Addison Plaza in Seat Pleasant on Central Avenue, less than a mile from the Washington, D.C., border.
Since that time, there’s been no major food retailer on that road for the almost four miles between the D.C. border and the Capital Beltway in Capitol Heights.
A small full-service grocer called Good Food Markets and Café opened in Addison Plaza in September 202. Because of financial challenges, however, only the café remained open. a year later. The business has since closed.
To help fill some of the void, The Capital Market has hosted farmers markets and various workshops in all three municipalities. Because of the nonprofit organization’s relationship with officials and residents, it will serve as a facilitator to the coalition.
According to the agreement, Capital Market will also “provide quarterly financial reports to all Parties (municipalities) detailing the use of funds and progress on initiative to each municipality.”
“These are three majority African American municipalities … [with] a lot of shared history and culture,” said Kyle Reeder, interim administrative director with Capital Market and a sixth-generation Prince Georgian, who lives in Capitol Heights. “I’m excited to see what the municipalities are able to do together.”
So is Belinda Queen, a community activist who also lives in Capitol Heights.
But at a community meeting Wednesday night, Queen urged state lawmakers from legislative District 25, which includes the neighborhood of Walker Mill in an unincorporated part of Capitol Heights, to make sure economic development does happen.
“The Blue Line corridor is supposed to be for all of us going through Capitol Heights,” she said. “So I need you guys to stay on this.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Addison-Road-Seat-Pleasant-station-5-15-2025-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-05-16 23:58:16.473608

(Image from MassAGO livestream)Attorneys general from around New England struck a defiant posture at a town hall gathering on Friday evening. Together they pledged that nothing is off the table when it comes to holding immigration officials accountable, lauded the courts for standing firm so far, and pointed at an ever-growing pile of litigation targeting the Trump administration’s actions on everything from energy policy to anti-discrimination law.
“All of us probably have a target on our back,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said, speaking from the IBEW Local 103 union hall in Dorchester. “But we say bring it on.”
The town hall included the region’s Democratic AGs – Campbell, William Tong of Connecticut, Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, Charity Clark of Vermont, and Aaron Frey of Maine. Billed as “United in Justice,” the gathering was distinctly aimed at Trump administration policies that the group has declared will damage the region and its residents.
Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are “unlawful” and “damaging.”
“After last November’s election and the anxiety that goes with it, we all felt our fight was gonna get a little tougher, a little steeper, and our work a lot harder,” said introductory speaker Lou Antonellis, business manager of the Dorchester union and executive vice president of the building and construction trades with the Greater Boston Labor Council. “And those words ring truer and truer every day for Americans because of this administration. Unless, of course, you’re rich.”
A union member at the town hall noted the administration’s antagonism toward renewable energy options, when unions are training their members on offshore wind work. Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month to block Trump’s pause on all federal wind-energy approvals.
Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad. Gov. Maura Healey made a national name for herself as attorney general by, like her successor Campbell, taking an aggressive stance toward the first Trump presidency. Her office sued the administration nearly 100 times, while Campbell has filed more than a dozen suits against the administration in the first 100 days of the new Trump term.
State law enforcement officials are in a tricky spot when it comes to defending against some federal policies, the attorneys general noted, especially around immigration. Multiple attendees asked what the state can do to push back on what one described as an “autocratic police state.”
There is significant federal authority to enforce and create immigration policies, placing the attorneys general in “uncharted territory” in figuring out how to wield state power against federal actors.
The offices are putting out guidance for individuals and organizations, fighting against policy changes that would claw back immigration protections like Temporary Protected Status, connecting people with lawyers, and reminding law enforcement that it does not need to enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Campbell spoke complimentarily of the decision by Worcester’s police chief to request that charges be dropped against the distraught 16-year-old daughter of a woman arrested in an ICE incident that has drawn intense backlash.
But “nothing is off the table” when it comes to pushing back on ICE oversteps, she said.
“If the US attorney can threaten us about us getting in the way of these policies and immigration enforcement, well guess what? We can bring it back,” Campbell said, adding slyly, “in a collaborative and loving way.”
Neronha, of Rhode Island, said withholding cooperation to federal agents looking to “commandeer” state law enforcement could be a serious impediment to ICE efforts.
He also laid out how he sees the administration’s playbook in general: bypass congressional power of the purse, strip allocated taxpayer dollars from essential programs or make sweeping declarations on constitutional matters, and challenge the legitimacy of district courts when they issue nationwide injunctions blocking the president’s actions.
“What we’re dealing with here, in my view, is a creeping authoritarianism,” he said. “And it’s not really creeping, is it?” To constituents who are looking for hope, he asked that they remember “every day there are lawyers who get up in the morning, like my colleagues here and all across the country in Democratic states, and fight for you. We are your lawyers. We are fighting for you, and we are winning.”
The latest legal volley from a collective of Democratic attorneys general – including the five New England AGs participating in the town hall – challenges a federal threat to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement actions.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an emailed statement to Axios that no funding has been withheld.
New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who was elected president of The National Association of Attorneys General in December and has not joined attorney general coalitions suing the Trump administration during this second term, is the only Republican attorney general in New England and was the only regional AG not present. A spokesperson said Formella had a full schedule for New Hampshire law enforcement memorial day, but the spokesman was not aware of Friday night’s town hall.
As attorney general of the most conservative New England state – though it narrowly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election – Formella’s office does not always split along partisan lines. He joined other Republican attorneys general in suits against former President Joe Biden, such as a volley against a vaccination-testing mandate, but also brought a civil rights lawsuit in 2024 against members of the neo-Nazi group Nationalist Social Club-131 who allegedly harassed a Concord cafe hosting drag story hours.
The day before the town hall, Campbell and Tong joined Democratic attorneys general from New Jersey, Washington, and California after U.S. Supreme Court arguments on Trump’s executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who enter the U.S. illegally or on a temporary visa.
Tong noted on Friday that so far the “courts are holding,” but some of the voices in the current administration are still talking about potentially “de-naturalizing” American citizens like his parents, Tong said.
The case currently before the nation’s high court is ostensibly about whether lower court judges can issue injunctions halting presidential executive orders nationwide – rather than only applying to a specific set of plaintiffs who bring suits inside specific jurisdictions – but justices toyed with whether they should consider the underlying merits of the birthright citizenship suit as well.
“I think what’s most important is not just the limited argument today,” Campbell said. “It’s that everyone should care about this birthright citizenship issue. It is not just about the access to citizenship and the privileges afforded by citizenship. If they can dismantle the 14th Amendment in our Constitution, they can also dismantle the other rights and privileges afforded our residents.”
The president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, after the arguments before the Supreme Court.
“The Radical Left SleazeBags, which has no cards remaining in its illegal bag of tricks, is, in a very coordinated manner, PLAYING THE REF with regard to the United States Supreme Court,” he posted. “They lost the Election in a landslide, and with it, have totally lost their confidence and reason. They are stone cold CRAZY! I hope the Supreme Court doesn’t fall for the games they play. The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”
Trump continued lashing out throughout Friday after the U.S. Supreme Court maintained a block on his deportations under wartime law.
The U.S. government is ultimately “an honor system,” Tong said, constructed of people bound together by belief and commitment to democratic principles. No higher power is going to force Trump to comply with the rule of law, but the country is too diverse and decentralized to be “swallowed whole” by any one administration, he added
“Be as noisy and chaotic and boisterous as we can be,” he said, “in every state and every jurisdiction, and make it hard for them every step of the way.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House voted to advance a bill that would establish a statewide tracking system for sexual assault examination kits, expedite processing times, and ensure that survivors can privately monitor the status of their own kit. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed the legislation, House Bill 62, and the House passed the bill on Friday with a vote of 39 to 0. One member, Rep. Rebecca Schwanke, R-Glennallen, was absent.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage and chair of the House Judiciary Committee spoke in support of the bill on the House floor on Friday. 
“House Bill 62 is a vital step toward strengthening Alaska’s response to sexual assault,” he said. “Currently, there’s no legally required timeline for when health care providers must notify law enforcement after completing a kit. House Bill 62 corrects this.”
If passed, the legislation would set more expedient timelines for processing sexual assault examination kits, which is a collection of physical evidence that can be used in criminal prosecution. Health care providers would have to notify law enforcement that a kit is ready for forensic testing within 14 days. The law enforcement agency would then have to submit the kit for forensic testing also within 14 days, down from 30 days. The lab would have to test the kit within 120 days, down from 180 days or six months.
Alaska law enforcement has made major progress on a statewide backlog in testing sexual assault examination kits in recent years, and Gray urged support for the bill to continue that positive trend. “Supported by advocacy groups, medical professionals and public safety officials, this bill is the result of a statewide collaboration,” he said. “With the backlog of untested kits now behind us, House Bill 62 ensures that we never have a backlog again.”
The legislation would also create a tracking system for survivors to privately monitor their own forensic kit through the testing process. David Kanaris, chief of the scientific crime detection laboratory in the Department of Public Safety testified before lawmakers in February that this was a major priority for the department.  
“Doing this previously had to be done through them contacting a law enforcement agency,” he said of kit tracking. “Which can be a traumatic experience in itself for the victim-survivor, and so allowing them to do it at their own pace through the kit tracking system was huge for us.”
The state already has a tracking system in place, supported by grant funding, according to the department, and the bill would provide that the state maintain the system, at an estimated cost of $200,000 per year.
With just five days left in the legislative session, the Alaska Senate is likely to take up the bill next year.

(Photo by Russ Taylor/National Park Service)As a fourth-generation sockeye salmon fisherman, I have my own reasons for disliking farmed fish. I started fishing with my family in Bristol Bay in 1979 on my great-grandfather’s site. That was the first year independent fishermen were paid $1 per pound for their salmon. The price increased for several years and then declined drastically when the farming of Atlantic salmon grew to an industrial scale in Norway and Chile, flooding the salmon market. Small-boat salmon fishermen found themselves bargaining for pennies per pound. Forty years later, it is not uncommon for us to be paid a base price less than a dollar per pound, with no adjustment for inflation. 
Despite how harmful industrial-scale finfish aquaculture has been for fishing families like mine, we are seeing efforts to expand it, at federal and state levels. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s bill to introduce inland finfish farming to Alaska threatens our wild seafood’s reputation. To keep finfish aquaculture at bay outside of state waters, the federal Keep Finfish Free Act of 2025, S.1529, provides a ray of hope. KFFA would block federal agencies from authorizing industrial fish farms in federally managed U.S. waters without congressional approval. This bill, first championed by the late Rep. Don Young, was just reintroduced by our own Sen. Dan Sullivan, along with Sen. Cory Booker. Note that KFFA would not deter beneficial forms of aquaculture, such as oyster and kelp farming; oysters filter water and kelp sequesters carbon.
Beyond finfish farming impacting the livelihoods of small-boat fishermen who feed the world, there are many reasons to be concerned. Ocean health is a big consideration: Large-scale finfish farms create oxygen-starved dead zones from fish waste that piles up. Net pens create conditions for disease that spread to wild fish. Antibiotics and antiparasitics, required to keep stocks from dying in crowded pens, flow freely into open water, contaminating ecosystems. They also end up in the farmed fish brought to market, ingested by consumers who think it’s as nutritious as wild fish. Dyes are added to feed to give the flesh of farmed salmon the color and appearance of wild salmon. And farmed fish consume vast amounts of feed made of wild fish, a practice that is depleting fish stocks and fueling global food insecurity.
The Keep Finfish Free Act helps preserve the proud legacy of Alaska’s wild seafood. It is an encouraging reflection of Sen. Sullivan’s appraisal and support of our state’s seafood sector. Perhaps a House companion bill will be taken up by our freshman legacy lawmaker Congressman Nick Begich, whose grandfather preceded Rep. Young in the same office. At the same time, Gov. Dunleavy’s bill to introduce finfish farming to Alaska concerns me as an Alaskan and fisherman alike. The touting of onshore recirculating aquaculture systems does not allay my fears of what could happen to our seafood industry. Lifting our 1990 finfish farm ban would open the door for fish farms to be built anywhere in our state — onshore or offshore, and harm our cherished salmon populations.
The words “wild,” “natural” and “sustainable” will hold no meaning to the Alaska seafood brand if finfish aquaculture is developed here. There is endless room for innovation with fish that are already available in our waters — and these fish grow themselves. Building local processing infrastructure, improving distribution routes, innovating products, and creating new markets could answer food security needs in our state and feed our own people. That includes full utilization of each fish — rather than wastefully discarding parts that aren’t neatly cut into fillets.
As a delegate to the World Forum of Fisher Peoples, I’ve spoken to enough small-scale and Indigenous fishermen from other parts of the world to learn that small-boat fleets are being pushed out of fishing grounds by industrial fish farms globally. And, this is not just about farmed versus wild seafood, the problem is one of scale across both aquaculture and wild capture fisheries. Around the world, large-scale commercial fishing operations catch enormous amounts of nontarget species, causing ecosystems and people to suffer. We cannot industrialize ourselves out of these problems.
The Alaska Senate and House versions of the finfish farming bills, Senate Bill 108 and House Bill 111, are alive in committees. The newly reintroduced Keep Finfish Free Act in the U.S. Senate, along with a potential companion bill sponsored by Congressman Begich, could create a positive balance and continue to protect our wild fish populations and the communities that depend on them from the harms of industrial aquaculture. Take the time to think about where you want your food to come from: a net pen of fish laden with antibiotics, pesticides, and dyes, or a small boat run by a family-owned fishing business.

Supplementing my teacher pay is helpful but my main reason for tutoring is to help struggling students to success.  This starts with being able to read.

I am troubled by the governor’s intention to cut the tutoring program for literacy and numeracy tutoring in favor of providing private school vouchers.

Whilst there may be some benefits to providing some students with vouchers to attend private schools, teaching a child to read– and therefore to be able to engage with the curriculum – should remain a top priority.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Rep. David Eastman lost his bid for reelection last November, but the Wasilla Republican’s legacy is still affecting the Alaska Legislature.
On Friday, the Legislature passed four bills that are attempts to redo legislation that passed the Capitol last year. The redo was encouraged by a lawsuit filed by Eastman against the Legislature in November. 
At the end of last year’s legislative session, lawmakers combined multiple bills — dealing with child care, state boards and hunting guide changes — in an effort to get them passed before the session’s constitutional deadline.
Legislative attorneys and even some legislators said at the time that the combination would be a violation of Article II, Section 13, of the Alaska Constitution, which says that “every bill shall be confined to one subject unless it is an appropriation bill or one codifying, revising, or rearranging existing laws.”
Eastman cites that section of the constitution in his lawsuit. With the suit moving forward, thus raising questions about the legality of the policies within the contested bill, legislators reintroduced each of the contested bills separately when the Legislature reconvened in January.
One of the bills creates a concession program for hunting guides, allowing the state to more tightly regulate the big-game hunting industry in Alaska. Two others are intended to help Alaska’s child care shortage, one by offering additional tax credits to companies that offer child care for their employees.
Each of the bills started in the Senate, and each passed the House on Friday, all by wide margins.
Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, called the redo “part of doing business” in the Capitol.
Last year’s state House was led by a predominantly Republican coalition majority. This year’s House is led by a predominantly Democratic coalition. Lawmakers traditionally feel pressure to finish their work before the end of the second year of the session and adjournment “sine die,” or without a fixed date to return.
“Being able to roll bills together on the sine die session can be a valuable tool, but I know at times it’s misused, which on occasion it is, (and) it can be a real sort of nuisance,” Edgmon said. “So I think more legislators support having that tool available if it’s used sparingly and sort of judiciously. But there are some who think that it’s not a necessary tool. So it’s been interesting to see that sort of juxtaposition.”
House Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said he feels good that all of the needed bills passed “unscathed.”
By phone, Eastman said that he doesn’t disagree with the policies in last year’s bill, but he does worry about the process and is concerned that lawmakers could be doing things in a way that the constitution’s framers didn’t intend.
Even though replacement bills have passed, the lawsuit should continue, he said, in order to prevent future legislatures from trying to repeat what happened last year.
“It’s not about whether I liked (the policies in the bill) or didn’t like them politically. It’s about whether or not we’re going to create a new normal where you can put any kind of things into a bill you want from whatever source, topic or subject matter, and you can just call it good,” he said.
Eastman said the Legislature’s actions last year raised a question that still isn’t resolved: “Are we going to build on that in the future and start a new direction, or are we going to go back to more the way that we’ve done things in the past? I hope that we go back to the way we’ve done things in the past.”
Attorney Joe Geldhof is representing Eastman in court.
“I’m glad it appears the Legislature enacted things according to the Constitution. This doesn’t end the case. David Eastman wants, David Eastman deserves, and I’ll try to get a declaration that what the Alaska Legislature did last year was unconstitutional,” Geldhof said by phone.
While the multi-subject legislation was aimed at wrapping up work before the end of the last day of the 2024 session, the House still passed five bills after midnight on that day. Gov. Mike Dunleavy later vetoed them, saying that they missed the deadline.
All five have been either re-introduced or introduced as part of a broader bill, and each of the five has either passed the Legislature or is on track to do so.
Eastman’s lawsuit and the resulting legislative process are likely to change the Capitol, Kopp said. “I think that there is going to be more of a concerted effort, not only with the single-subject rule, but also with the timing of passage of bills, not letting things get stacked up against midnight.”

Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are ""unlawful"" and “damaging.” 
The post New England AGs to Trump: ‘Bring i[...]","ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM around New England struck a defiant posture at a town hall gathering on Friday evening. Together they pledged that nothing is off the table when it comes to holding immigration officials accountable, lauded the courts for standing firm so far, and pointed at an ever-growing pile of litigation targeting the Trump administration’s actions on everything from energy policy to anti-discrimination law. “All of us probably have a target on our back,” Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said, speaking from the IBEW Local 103 union hall in Dorchester. “But we say bring it on.” The town hall included the region’s Democratic AGs – Campbell, William Tong of Connecticut, Peter Neronha of Rhode Island, Charity Clark of Vermont, and Aaron Frey of Maine. Billed as “United in Justice,” the gathering was distinctly aimed at Trump administration policies that the group has declared will damage the region and its residents.  Attorneys general, advocacy organizations, and individuals have leveled dozens of lawsuits at the Trump administration. They say that executive actions targeting immigration, the global economy, public health and scientific research funding, higher education, and marginalized groups are “unlawful” and “damaging.” “After last November’s election and the anxiety that goes with it, we all felt our fight was gonna get a little tougher, a little steeper, and our work a lot harder,” said introductory speaker Lou Antonellis, business manager of the Dorchester union and executive vice president of the building and construction trades with the Greater Boston Labor Council. “And those words ring truer and truer every day for Americans because of this administration. Unless, of course, you’re rich.” A union member at the town hall noted the administration’s antagonism toward renewable energy options, when unions are training their members on offshore wind work. Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in Boston federal court this month to block Trump’s pause on all federal wind-energy approvals. Being attorney general of a blue state during a Trump administration has proved to be a high-stakes launching pad. Gov. Maura Healey made a national name for herself as attorney general by, like her successor Campbell, taking an aggressive stance toward the first Trump presidency. Her office sued the administration nearly 100 times, while Campbell has filed more than a dozen suits against the administration in the first 100 days of the new Trump term. State law enforcement officials are in a tricky spot when it comes to defending against some federal policies, the attorneys general noted, especially around immigration. Multiple attendees asked what the state can do to push back on what one described as an “autocratic police state.”  There is significant federal authority to enforce and create immigration policies, placing the attorneys general in “uncharted territory” in figuring out how to wield state power against federal actors.  The offices are putting out guidance for individuals and organizations, fighting against policy changes that would claw back immigration protections like Temporary Protected Status, connecting people with lawyers, and reminding law enforcement that it does not need to enable Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Campbell spoke complimentarily of the decision by Worcester’s police chief to request that charges be dropped against the distraught 16-year-old daughter of a woman arrested in an ICE incident that has drawn intense backlash. But “nothing is off the table” when it comes to pushing back on ICE oversteps, she said. “If the US attorney can threaten us about us getting in the way of these policies and immigration enforcement, well guess what? We can bring it back,” Campbell said, adding slyly, “in a collaborative and loving way.” Neronha, of Rhode Island, said withholding cooperation to federal agents looking to “commandeer” state law enforcement could be a serious impediment to ICE efforts.  He also laid out how he sees the administration’s playbook in general: bypass congressional power of the purse, strip allocated taxpayer dollars from essential programs or make sweeping declarations on constitutional matters, and challenge the legitimacy of district courts when they issue nationwide injunctions blocking the president’s actions. “What we’re dealing with here, in my view, is a creeping authoritarianism,” he said. “And it’s not really creeping, is it?” To constituents who are looking for hope, he asked that they remember “every day there are lawyers who get up in the morning, like my colleagues here and all across the country in Democratic states, and fight for you. We are your lawyers. We are fighting for you, and we are winning.” The latest legal volley from a collective of Democratic attorneys general – including the five New England AGs participating in the town hall – challenges a federal threat to withhold billions of dollars in transportation and disaster-relief funds unless states agree to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement actions. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in an emailed statement to Axios that no funding has been withheld. New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who was elected president of The National Association of Attorneys General in December and has not joined attorney general coalitions suing the Trump administration during this second term, is the only Republican attorney general in New England and was the only regional AG not present. A spokesperson said Formella had a full schedule for New Hampshire law enforcement memorial day, but the spokesman was not aware of Friday night’s town hall.  As attorney general of the most conservative New England state – though it narrowly voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election – Formella’s office does not always split along partisan lines. He joined other Republican attorneys general in suits against former President Joe Biden, such as a volley against a vaccination-testing mandate, but also brought a civil rights lawsuit in 2024 against members of the neo-Nazi group Nationalist Social Club-131 who allegedly harassed a Concord cafe hosting drag story hours. The day before the town hall, Campbell and Tong joined Democratic attorneys general from New Jersey, Washington, and California after US Supreme Court arguments on Trump’s executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who enter the US illegally or on a temporary visa.  Tong noted on Friday that so far the “courts are holding,” but some of the voices in the current administration are still talking about potentially “de-naturalizing” American citizens like his parents, Tong said. The case currently before the nation’s high court is ostensibly about whether lower court judges can issue injunctions halting presidential executive orders nationwide – rather than only applying to a specific set of plaintiffs who bring suits inside specific jurisdictions – but justices toyed with whether they should consider the underlying merits of the birthright citizenship suit as well. “I think what’s most important is not just the limited argument today,” Campbell said. “It’s that everyone should care about this birthright citizenship issue. It is not just about the access to citizenship and the privileges afforded by citizenship. If they can dismantle the 14th Amendment in our Constitution, they can also dismantle the other rights and privileges afforded our residents.” The president took to his social media platform, Truth Social, after the arguments before the Supreme Court. “The Radical Left SleazeBags, which has no cards remaining in its illegal bag of tricks, is, in a very coordinated manner, PLAYING THE REF with regard to the United States Supreme Court,” he posted. “They lost the Election in a landslide, and with it, have totally lost their confidence and reason. They are stone cold CRAZY! I hope the Supreme Court doesn’t fall for the games they play. The people are with us in bigger numbers than ever before. They want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump continued lashing out throughout Friday after the US Supreme Court maintained a block on his deportations under wartime law. The US government is ultimately “an honor system,” Tong said, constructed of people bound together by belief and commitment to democratic principles. No higher power is going to force Trump to comply with the rule of law, but the country is too diverse and decentralized to be “swallowed whole” by any one administration, he added “Be as noisy and chaotic and boisterous as we can be,” he said, “in every state and every jurisdiction, and make it hard for them every step of the way.” The post New England AGs to Trump: ‘Bring it on’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-16-at-7.44.00%E2%80%AFPM.png?fit=1024%2C602&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 22:00:52.535214

(Grant Stringer/States Newsroom)Tolling on the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River will start a year later than planned – but drivers traveling between Washington and Oregon may pay a little more than originally forecast as a result.
Tolling in both directions on the existing bridge will be one of the first things the public experiences once construction of a replacement bridge gets underway. It is also a critical source of funding to help cover the cost of the project, which could range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion.
For months,it’s been projected that toll collections would begin on the existing bridge early next year when construction of the replacement bridge was expected to start. Project managers now say tolling won’t start before the summer of 2027, likely after the megaproject is underway.
On Friday, a panel of transportation commissioners from each state pondered how best to avoid losing out on a year’s worth of revenue.
The Bi-State Tolling Subcommittee recommended sticking to the initial toll rate shared with the public over months of meetings, but the committee said rates should increase enough in the second and third years to make up for the year delay.
Each state’s transportation commission must approve the recommendation. If that happens, work will begin to detail how much revenue can be generated from different toll rates. 
Several possible rate scenarios are under review. These have one-way rates ranging from $1.55 to $4.70 with higher prices during peak travel times. It is assumed rates will rise on a yearly or biannual basis. 
In separate meetings this month, the Washington State Transportation Commission and Oregon Transportation Commission learned about the different options for making up for the year’s loss of collections. 
On Tuesday, Washington commissioner Debbie Young said that in the first year it was important to let the public know they would “keep the toll rate that we said we would.” She supported increasing it more in the ensuing years to catch up. 
Other commissioners agreed with the approach – as long as the target for toll receipts is met.
“We want to finish this with a bridge,” Commissioner Nicole Grant said.
Delayed toll collections are a byproduct of slower-than-planned progress on other parts of the project.
The final analysis of the project’s environmental impacts won’t be done until the end of the year. Officials with the Interstate Bridge Replacement Program said in a statement that they expect to get a key federal approval known as an amended record of decision in early 2026. It is needed before construction-related contracts can be issued.
“Our federal agency partners have provided us with our current schedule,” the statement reads, adding construction is expected to begin sometime in 2026.
Based on that schedule, planners now anticipate cars would begin driving across a new bridge in 2032 or 2033 and construction would last at least 10 to 15 years through the five-mile corridor on either side of the bridge.
Meanwhile, Washington state lawmakers passed legislation allowing for a huge increase in the amount of toll revenues assumed for the multi-year project.
House Bill 1958, which awaits action by Gov. Bob Ferguson, would authorize the state to sell up to $2.5 billion in general obligation bonds, $900 million more than assumed when the bill was first introduced in February. With significant cost increases on major highway and bridge projects in recent years, backers have said it made sense to recalibrate but doing so doesn’t mean the state will necessarily seek higher bonding capacity. 
Bonds, a long-assumed source of financing for the new span, would pay for design and construction, as well as future maintenance and operation.
The borrowed money would be repaid with toll proceeds, gas taxes and vehicle fees. Because the bonds would be backed by “the full faith and credit of the state,” the general fund could be tapped as a last-resort source of repayment.
Because Washington will be administering the tolling program, it is the one that needs to issue the bonds.

The frustration is tied to apprehension about government spending as well as strings attached to federal grants. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A trio of Republican members on the Kansas State Board of Education shared frustration with routine acceptance of federal grants for education programs that include policy mandates contrary to political perspectives of many of their constituents.
During recent meetings of the state Board of Education, members Debby Potter of Garden Plain, Connie O’Brien of Tonganoxie and Michelle Dombrosky of Olathe shared objections to linking federal spending to policy.
Attorneys with the state Board of Education and Kansas State Department of Education warned the 10-member board to give careful consideration to votes on federal grants to avoid undermining operation of school districts statewide.
“If we just vote ‘no’ on money, then where does that leave us?” said state board chairperson Cathy Hopkins of Hays. “What is the plan?”
Dombrosky, who won election to the board in 2018 and reelection in 2022, said federal aid to schools was infected with ill-conceived mandates put in place by the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden. Objectionable ideas attached to education grants made it into books and other classroom resources, she said. Republican President Donald Trump is in the process of reversing Biden-era mandates, she said.
“A lot of parents went crazy over the curriculum that was coming into our school system,” she said. “Now, we have a new administration that’s in there that’s pulling these things back, because people voted for that. People wanted that out of there. They wanted it out of the school system.”
She said the state’s acceptance of federal aid placed local Kansas school districts in a quandary.
“Sounds to me like we’ve fostered a dependency on the federal money,” Dombrosky said. “If this money were to go away tomorrow, would it stand alone on merit?”
 
Culture change
O’Brien, a former member of the Kansas House who won election to the state board in 2024, said excessive spending across government and mounting debt at the federal level necessitated cuts in expenditures. She also expressed opposition to anchoring policy to federal grants.
“When I talk to people, they’re concerned about taxes,” she said. “At some point, we need to start reining in the spending part and we’re going to have to do it in education, health care, everything.”
Potter, also elected last year to the state board, has said obligations attached to federal grants sought to diminish the influence of parents who were responsible for deciding the type of education provided their children.
The federal government is an intrusion into the relationship between parents and teachers, she said.
Potter said she was eager to create an environment that restored public faith in the state Board of Education.
“I’m trying to change the culture, somewhat, of the board,” Potter said.
She said she wanted more information included in official minutes of monthly state board meetings so Kansans had a better idea what transpired and what was said on financial and policy matters.
“We have constituents that do not trust the administration, and the administration has not earned my trust either,” she said.
 
State obligations
Scott Gordon, general counsel to the Kansas State Department of Education, said most federally funded programs included measures intended to hold recipients accountable. Failure to comply could place the entirety of funding at risk, he said.
“Generally, there is an all-or-none approach to compliance,” Gordon said. “You don’t get to comply with 75% or 80% of the federal requirements and still get to keep all the money.”
For example, he said, on April 8 the state board voted on a motion to earmark $20,000 in federal funds to sponsor public service announcements with information about where children could receive free meals during summer months. The 5-5 tie vote was equivalent to rejection of the motion, which meant opponents Dombrosky, P0tter, O’Brien, Dennis Hershberger and Danny Zeck, all Republicans, were successful in blocking expenditure of those federal dollars to inform children and families.
That federal funding previously created a 1:3 match, meaning the $20,000 investment generated the equivalent of $60,000 in advertising in Kansas.
Gordon said the board’s vote on the $20,000 allocation was the type that theoretically could threaten Kansas’ free- and reduced-lunch program through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The state Department of Education has the option of seeking an alternative funding source for promoting the summer food program, he said.
“It doesn’t just hurt the board or the department,” he said. “It hurts the people that are relying on that money.”
 
Due process
Mark Ferguson, who has provided legal counsel to the state Board of Education since 2009, said the recommendation wasn’t that board members should continue federal programs just because the state had done so for years.
“There’s not an expectation that you continue to just rubber stamp those things,” he said.
He urged the state Board of Education to work through funding or policy issues in a way that provided due process to recipients of those programs. Due process included notice to Kansans about potential changes and granted people an opportunity to share their views, he said.
He said the state board hadn’t previously incorporated the due process piece into decision making because, as a whole, actions of the state board on federal programs largely maintained the status quo. Change in the state board’s membership altered the dynamic sufficiently to warrant adoption of due process guidelines, he said.
“I would encourage the board, if making decisions that negatively impact others, to factor in due process,” Ferguson said. “Let’s not just vote ‘no’ and take that away. Let’s anticipate that decision, give notice to the public and get some input so that’s not just the rug being pulled out in the 11th hour.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Michelle-Dombrosky-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 20:03:10.357634

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s rates on unemployment and job growth are surpassing national averages this year and the state has kept its top spot in economic outlook ranking. But, amid tariffs, and a dropping consumer sentiment, economists warn the state is entering risky waters.
The state’s economy is outperforming other states, with jobs growing 2.1%, almost doubling the 1.2% national average. Utah also has some of the lowest unemployment rates, 3.1%, while that number remained unchanged at 4.2% nationally, according to a report from the Utah Department of Workforce Services released on Friday.
“Labor market indicators remain robust, with broad job expansions across industries and a low unemployment rate,” Ben Crabb, chief economist with the department, said in a statement. “The level of job openings continues to exceed the number of unemployed workers in the state as employers promptly employ available labor.”

The top private sector industries adding jobs to the state are education and health services, followed by construction and manufacturing.
According to Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute data shared by Natalie Gochnour, the institute’s director, to the Salt Lake City Council on Tuesday, nearly half of the state’s jobs are in Salt Lake County, and 1 in 4 jobs are in Salt Lake City. “A stunning number when you think of the breadth of the state,” Gochnour said. That’s over 400,000 roles in the city. 
Immigration, housing and tariffs awake uncertainty in Utah’s 2025 economic outlook

“We’re in an elite economy nationwide, as a state, and the urban center is participating and contributing to the economic vibrancy of the state in a big way.”
Utah also led the nation in gross domestic product growth in 2024 with 4.5%, compared to a 2.8% national average, and earned other top spots in the country, including one of the highest household incomes with cost of living adjustments, and the lowest poverty rate. 
But a recession is possible
With this economic growth, whether a recession is coming is not apparent yet, Gochnour said. However, Utahns may still feel the impact of other economic national trends, and she believes it is for “self-inflicted” reasons, such as tariffs, which she described as “a tax on trade.”
“A reason many of the economists aren’t forecasting a recession right now is because as things start to look bad, the administration will change and come to the rescue,” Gochnour said. 
During the first term of the Trump administration, tariff rates went from 1% to 3%, which the Biden administration kept. Now, according to Moody’s Analytics calculations, the potential rate during President Donald Trump’s second term could climb to 11.5%. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Estimates predicting the future economics in the country have been uncertain this year and are constantly changing. But, the latest numbers, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Gardner Institute and Wells Fargo Economics, indicate that there may be a recession during the last half of 2025, with the country’s gross domestic product falling 0.9% during the third quarter and 1.1% during the fourth quarter.
“Right now, the probability of a recession among most economists is somewhere in the 45% to 60% rate,” Gochnour said. “So, flip of a coin. We’ll see.”
What’s already happening, though, is the free fall of consumer sentiment in the country, an index used to measure how consumers view current and future economic conditions.
“And so you got a consumer that’s feeling a little funky, you’ve got businesses with a lot of uncertainty, so they’re not hiring, or they’re pausing, they’re not investing, and eventually that’s going to show up in the numbers,” she said. “This should be a leading indicator to all of us.”
Another fall felt in the state is a decline of job growth in leisure and hospitality. According to the Department of Workforce Services’ summary, that industry shrank by 400 jobs in the last year, the second-largest private sector decline after the trade, transportation and utilities industry, which experienced the loss of 2,300 jobs.
Gochnour attributes that to tempered international travel, an effect of federal policies, as well as cuts in national parks, with employee counts declining 13% only this year, among other causes. The forecast for international visitation as of March is a 9.4% decline, according to Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics research company.

(Photo provided by the Indiana Department of Correction)A federal judge will soon decide whether media should have guaranteed access to witness Indiana’s next execution, which is scheduled to take place just after midnight Tuesday.
During a Friday morning hearing in Evansville, in Indiana’s southern district, lawyers representing five news entities — including the Indiana Capital Chronicle — argued that a state law barring press from witnessing state executions violates the First Amendment.
The plaintiffs asked Judge Matthew Brookman to issue a preliminary injunction that would block the state law, for now, and ensure that journalists have access to the scheduled execution of death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, as well as future executions during the pendency of the case.
News outlets seek to pause Indiana law barring journalists from witnessing executions

Up for debate, as well, is a Department of Correction (DOC) policy that says press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution.”
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Indiana Attorney General’s Office pushed back, arguing that journalists have no constitutional right, or privilege, to witness executions.
Jeff Garn, representing the state, emphasized that any last-minute changes to add media to the upcoming execution’s witness lists would disrupt a “highly-coordinated” process that’s been rehearsed for months by DOC staff. 
He questioned, too, whether the state prison’s two designated execution chamber witness rooms can be modified — in a matter of days — to accommodate additional capacity.
The federal judge did not immediately rule on the preliminary injunction request but promised a “timely” decision.
Room for reporters
Attorneys with the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press are representing the news entities, which include the Capital Chronicle, The Associated Press, Gannett, Circle City Broadcasting and TEGNA.
Lin Weeks, on behalf of the plaintiffs, maintained Friday that public access to executions is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability as the state carries out “the most severe” punishment it can impose. Journalists, he said, serve as surrogates of the public.
“Public access ensures executions are competently and humanely administered,” Weeks told the court, adding that details, including any “missteps,” about such procedures “should be known to members of the public.”
“The public,” he continued, “needs to see justice carried out.”

Weeks said media-reported information is also of importance to other condemned inmates awaiting to be put to death. Ritchie and six other men are currently on death row at Indiana State Prison.
The news organizations’ underlying complaint centers on an Indiana law that limits attendance at executions to: the warden, a warden’s designated assistant, the prison physician, another physician, a spiritual advisor, a prison chaplain, five friends or relatives of the inmate and eight members of the victim’s family.
Weeks said the plaintiffs are seeking four witness spots specifically for reporters. Current law and DOC policy only allow 13 witnesses total.
Those four witnesses could be included in the 13 allowed currently, or additional spots could be added to one or both rooms that provide visibility into the execution chamber, Weeks told the judge.
He said the Capital Chronicle and other news outlets have requested spots on Ritchie’s witness list but have so far been denied.
Reporters from all five news entities have covered portions of the case and The Associated Press regularly covers executions nationwide.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two states — along with Wyoming — that doesn’t include media witnesses at executions.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed December’s state execution of Joseph Corcoran — via the inmate’s guest list.
Weeks also held that Indiana’s law treats the press more harshly than other members of the public. While victims’ families and a condemned person’s friends or clergy may attend, the media is explicitly barred unless a journalist is handpicked by the inmate.
He additionally pointed out that up to 10 journalists are allowed to observe federal executions conducted at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute. Closed-circuit television has also been available in the past for federal prison executions to be viewed outside the designated witness areas.  
State says request comes ‘too late’
Garn, however, argued that executions are not public events and that media have no inherent right to witness them. 
“They do not have a right to observe the execution,” Garn said, maintaining that executions differ from criminal trials, for example. “This is not a (public) proceeding. This is an operation, carrying out a sentence of an incarcerated person.”
He said it’s “unclear” how DOC staff would accommodate media if a short-notice injunction is granted.
“This case was brought too late for the execution scheduled on Tuesday,” Garn reiterated.

He emphasized that chairs in the execution chamber’s two witness rooms “are literally bolted to the floor,” leaving limited flexibility for additional observers.
He said the plaintiffs filed their primary injunction request “too late,” noting that the state requested an execution date for Ritchie in September, and a challenge to state law “should have been filed earlier.” The Indiana Supreme Court set the execution date April 15.
Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal, one of the defendants — and the only person to provide witness testimony before the court at the Friday hearing — also raised concerns about the confidentiality of execution team members.
“If the identities of those involved are not protected, I wouldn’t have a team,” the warden said.
Neal presided over Corcoran’s execution in December. Before that, he was involved in the 2009 state execution of Eric Wrinkles — the last death sentence to be carried out before Indiana’s 15-year execution hiatus.  
He said the execution room for the condemned holding five witnesses is “tight” and “very limited.” His court declaration said it was 10-by-10 feet.
Online descriptions of a 10-by-10 foot-storage unit say it is equivalent to a small bedroom or half of a one-car-garage.
The Capital Chronicle’s experience at the December execution found there were four chairs in the condemned witness room bolted to the two-levels of the riser. In addition, there were three empty chairs elsewhere in the room. Two guards also were in the room.
After an execution date is set, Neal said DOC staff practice the process at least once each week ahead of the execution date. 
Communication between the prison and offices of the governor and the attorney general are tested. An intravenous line is inserted “into a live (volunteer) every time” a training is held.
Staff are also taught the precise steps taken to escort witnesses to and from the execution chamber. Neal conceded, though, that “there’s always a possibility that folks don’t show up, and we plan accordingly.”










We take it very seriously … we don’t want to make any mistakes.


– Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal


All DOC employees involved in the process then participate in a full, step-by-step “dress rehearsal” the day before a scheduled execution, Neal said.
“We go to great lengths … just as we would on the day of an execution,” he told the court. “We take it very seriously … we don’t want to make any mistakes.”
Garn suggested the case could be more appropriately litigated after the current execution, and even mentioned a possible future settlement conference. 
Weeks, referencing Neal’s testimony, argued that DOC staff are trained “to handle flexibility in the number of people” who attend as witnesses.
The media attorney argued that DOC staff have accommodated changes to witness lists before — even in the days preceding an execution — and could still do so before Tuesday.
Gov. Mike Braun rejected a clemency plea from Ritchie on Wednesday, one day after the Indiana Parole Board recommended that the death row inmate’s upcoming execution proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole.

Three bills passed in 2025 changing voter laws have been challenged in court. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Two lawsuits challenging three different voter-related laws passed during the 2025 Legislative Session were filed this month in Montana district courts, pushing back against a suite of bills Republican legislators have said are essential to preserve the integrity of the state’s elections.
The Montana Federation of Public Employees on Monday filed a lawsuit alleging a bill repealing election-day registration, and a bill strengthening voter ID requirements, are unconstitutional, while the Montana Public Interest Research Group (MontPIRG) filed suit earlier this month against a bill that prevents college students from voting in a community unless they intend to stay there permanently. 
Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, signed all three bills, which largely passed along partisan lines, into law. 
House Bill 413, introduced by Rep. Jane Gillette, R-Three Forks, changed the definition of residency in Montana code, stating that individuals cannot become residents, and therefore vote, in a county if they are there for “temporary work, training, or an educational program.” The bill includes a requirement that voters intend to make a county their permanent home following their temporary purpose in order to vote. 
MontPIRG, which represents nearly 28,000 students across the state, said the law effectively disenfranchises any college students who move to attend school. 
“HB 413 singles out these students and requires them to attest—under penalty of perjury—that they intend to make the county where they are studying their “permanent home at the conclusion of” their “educational program,” thus deterring and depriving many students of the ability to exercise their fundamental right to vote,” the complaint, filed in Missoula District Court, states. 
As an example, court documents say that a student from Sidney who moves to Missoula for college must predict where she will live after she graduates, and if she doesn’t commit to living in Missoula County, she “cannot register to vote there — the community where she lives works, volunteers, likely pays taxes, and studies.”
But, if that student drops out of school and gets a job in town, she can register to vote as long as she’s been in Montana for 30 days, “irrespective of her future plans.”
While speaking on the bill during the Legislature, Gillette said the bill was not aimed at students, but at temporary workers such as traveling nurses. She also said the bill was about intent — and someone living in a community for several years could still have the intention to leave and that should be taken into consideration before they can vote in that community. 
“By imposing special requirements that bar student voters from registering to vote in their communities, HB 413 violates the rights of suffrage and equal protection guaranteed by the Montana and U.S. Constitutions,” according to the complaint. 
The two bills challenged by MFPE in Lewis and Clark District Court were carried by Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka. 
Senate Bill 490 tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on the day of the election under the new law, and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it up on the prior Saturday. 
Previously, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations. 
Last Election Day, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot. 
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill. 
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 a.m.,” Cuffe wrote. 
Both of the bills challenged, along with others Cuffe carried in the Legislature, were intended to bolster Montanans’ “confidence in the purity of our elections. That’s why I focused so much of my time on the issue,” Cuffe said.
Senate Bill 276 enacts photo identification voting in Montana, and expands the variety of ID options allowed to include tribal photo ID cards, military IDs, U.S. Passports, driver’s licenses and student ID cards. 
“Voter identification is a nonpartisan, commonsense best practice, and I’m pleased that the Montana Legislature agrees,” said Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen in a press release when the bill was sent to Gianforte. “Enacting these voter ID laws will streamline processes for election officials and provide a better election experience for Montana voters.”
The legal complaint from MFPE cites a Montana Supreme Court decision from 2024 that struck down a law passed in 2021 eliminating Election Day voter registration, and another that sought to narrow the list of acceptable photo IDs allowed, as evidence for why the new bills should fail. 
“These bills are plainly unconstitutional and clearly contravene the Supreme Court’s (decision),” according to court filings. “This Court must enjoin the Legislature’s attempted end-run around binding precedent and the voting rights of Montana citizens.”
Attorney Raph Graybill, a former Democratic candidate for Lieutenant Governor, is representing the plaintiffs in both cases. The Elias Law Group is also representing the plaintiffs.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota will need a third more prison space than it has now by 2036, and lawmakers’ choice to pass a so-called truth in sentencing bill in 2023 is a major reason why.
That’s among the takeaways from a new report on the state’s prison infrastructure that says the state would need to spend between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion on new prisons to deal with an inmate population that’s projected to swell in spite of the state’s decreasing crime rate. 
The state needs a 1,700-bed men’s prison immediately, the report from Arrington Watkins says. Even then, it says, another 1,500 beds for men will be necessary in a little more than 10 years, when it projects a prison population of more than 5,000 people. 
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

The state signed a $729,000 contract with the Phoenix-based firm as part of “Project Prison Reset,” a work group formed by gubernatorial fiat in the face of state lawmakers’ refusal to back an $850 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Lincoln County in February.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, chairman of the work group, said the report supports the group’s first official vote last month, which was to conclude that the state does need at least one new prison. 
Venhuizen was quick to point out that the $2 billion price tag would only apply if the state followed the consultant’s guidance to the letter and built two large prisons, but said the population projections lay bare the stakes of South Dakota’s current approach to criminal justice.
The work group’s job is not to address the drivers of prison population growth, he said. But he also said he’s glad the report took note of those driving forces. 
The truth in sentencing bill, SB 146, requires people convicted of violent offenses to serve between 85% and 100% of their sentences, depending on the category of their crime.
As a legislator in 2023, Venhuizen voted against SB 146, and its potential to impact prison populations “was part of the reason why.”
“Those decisions are not free. You have to strike a balance there,” Venhuizen said. “If you’re sending people to prison for longer, there is a cost to that.”
The bill’s author and prime sponsor, Republican former Sen. Brent Hoffman, has a different take on the legislation’s impact on South Dakota’s correctional needs. 
“The real issue isn’t SB 146, which protects the public by requiring violent criminals to serve their sentences,” said Hoffman, a supporter of term limits who served one term and opted against running for a second in 2024. “The underlying, systemic problems are recidivism rates, wasteful spending, misguided priorities and incompetence, and those problems won’t be solved by any consultant’s report or politician’s rhetoric.”
Prison population growth
Every correctional facility in South Dakota is beyond its capacity now. The South Dakota State Penitentiary was built in 1881 to house one inmate per cell, but holds twice as many. 
The proposed 1,500-bed facility in Lincoln County, mired in controversy over cost and necessity and still tied up in litigation over its location, was meant to replace the penitentiary. 
There are two other housing units on the penitentiary campus in Sioux Falls, however, and each of those faces its own issues with overcrowding.
The maximum-security Jameson Annex, for example, is overbooked because it houses not only maximum security inmates, but those in disciplinary segregation and those with serious mental health needs. It’s also the sorting zone for every new male inmate in the state system, where inmates stay as they’re assessed for longer-term placement.
With $50 million spent already, state hires new consultant to restart prison planning

The Sioux Falls Minimum Center, meanwhile, holds 245 men in a building designed for 96.
Even with a large but temporary drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, new admissions to Department of Corrections custody grew an average of 3.2% a year between 2015 and 2024, the report says.
That’s in spite of a crime rate in South Dakota that’s lower than the national average and on the decline. The state’s total population has gone the other direction, increasing by 0.9% a year since 2010.
Much of the long-term factors built into the new report were present for its predecessor, a report from Omaha’s DLR group that pointed to a 1,500-bed men’s facility as one of several necessary projects for the DOC.
Senate Bill 146 is a wrinkle that didn’t exist for the DLR group, some portions of which were used by Arrington Watkins in its expedited, two-month repeat assessment.
SB 146 ropes in fewer than 10% of the state’s inmates, the report notes – drug offenses are the most common charge for which South Dakotans are imprisoned – but the inability of those convicted of violent offenses to be released before serving at least 85% of their sentence will have a long-term impact on prison population growth.
“Roughly half” of the 1,246 more inmates the report anticipates South Dakota will have by 2036 is attributable to SB 146.
Parole violations are another driver of population growth, the report notes. About 45% of new admissions to the DOC came by way of parole violations in 2024, the report says, and 84% of those violations “were technical in nature rather than new criminal charges.”
Minnehaha County State’s Attorney Daniel Haggar cautioned that technical parole violations often involve serious misbehavior, however. Technical violations include drug use, he said, as well as absconding – losing touch with a parole officer altogether.
“When those offenders are violent offenders or sex offenders this is a threat to public safety,” he said in an email to South Dakota Searchlight on Friday.
Responses colored with skepticism of price tag, conclusions
The state has already spent more than $50 million on the Lincoln County site, although a share of that money could be clawed back by selling land or reusing aspects of the now-stalled prison’s design.
Governor relents, appoints task force to reset prison talks after legislative loss

The new report’s top recommendation is a 1,700-bed, Level V facility, built within 30 miles of the existing penitentiary to relieve crowding across the entirety of the men’s prison system. It also recommends demolishing the 1881 penitentiary.
“Level V” is correctional nomenclature for maximum security.
Former penitentiary warden Doug Weber wrote seven letters to lawmakers during the 2025 session urging them to say no to the 1,500-bed facility in Lincoln County, essentially a smaller version of what the new report says is necessary. 
The focus on the factors driving the state’s prison population growth raises important questions, Weber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday, but he disagrees strongly with its conclusions on how to remedy the situation.
“There’s nobody in South Dakota, in my opinion, except a handful of people, maybe in Pierre, that would be comfortable spending $2.1 billion on buildings for the Department of Corrections,” said Weber. “There are much better ways to spend money.”
Weber called a Level V facility unnecessary and too expensive in a state where the number of maximum security inmates hovers around 200. 
He also bristles at the idea of knocking down the pen. Millions have been spent to maintain it in recent years, including for air conditioning less than five years ago, and Weber said it could easily serve as a minimum security facility by removing the cell doors and putting a single person in each cell.
Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, a work group member and candidate for governor in 2026, said “there’s absolutely no way that I will support spending that much money on prisons.”
“If we needed to be building new facilities, we should be looking at the current location in Sioux Falls for a lot less money,” Hansen said.
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

Madeline Voegeli, one of the neighbors to the Lincoln County site who sued the state over the issue, said in an email to Searchlight that the group has serious doubts about the veracity of the report’s population projections.
The DLR report, completed in 2022, suggested a 1,300-bed men’s prison at a cost of around $608 million.
Now, she wrote, “we’re being told to swallow a nearly quadrupled cost of up to $2.1 billion, largely driven by SB 146 and questionable population projections.”
Voegeli accused the state of engaging in a “pattern of inflating proposals to make a billion-dollar plan” – the original Lincoln County proposal – “appear reasonable.”
Venhuizen said arguments suggesting that the Lincoln County plan’s supporters tried to tip the scale in the consultant’s report are misplaced.
“It’s not a strong position to assume that everyone who disagrees with you is being dishonest,” Venhuizen said. “If you’re doing that, you should probably examine the strength of your own arguments.”
Criminal justice reform questions
Rep. Karla Lems, a Canton Republican who’s both a work group member and an avowed opponent of the Lincoln County proposal, said Friday that she’s skeptical of the conclusions, as well.
The work group is meant to deliver its recommendations to a special legislative session in July. The state, she said, needs to spend more time thinking about reducing repeat offenses before it decides what to build.
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, is also a work group member. He said the state needs to think “innovatively” on how to reduce prison populations, and that the report is a clear sign of how necessary that is. Mulder was one of the prime sponsors of a bill to change the penalty for first- and second-offense drug ingestion from a felony to a misdemeanor during the 2025 session. 
Too few prisoners are getting drug treatment, Mulder said, and he feels the state ought to consider partnering with nonprofits to extend treatment’s reach both inside the prison and outside, for parolees.
He also has questions about parole supervision practices.
“I would ask ‘what’s going on now with things like remote monitoring,’” Mulder said. “It’s a lot more effective for the state for someone so they can continue to be held accountable, but be held at home.”

Mulder supported truth in sentencing and continues to, though. He said parole reforms make more sense. 
Reforms to truth in sentencing laws ought to be up for consideration, though, according to Zoë Towns, executive director of a bipartisan think tank called Fwd.Us.
Her group pushes for changes to criminal justice and immigration policy. The knock-on effects of incarceration for families and communities are heavy, Towns said, and the returns for public safety diminish significantly when inmates don’t have a chance to earn credit for good behavior – even when the people earning them committed violent offenses.
“What we should be asking is ‘how long is incapacitation actually helpful?’” Towns said. “What are the policies that are most likely to help people, when they come home, to contribute to their communities and local economies?”
Addressing behavioral health needs and addiction early on are more effective ways to deal with crime than incarceration, she said, but other strategies are even further removed from criminal justice.
Towns pointed to research from places like the Brookings Institute that suggest investments in youth education and public health offer long-term returns for public safety.
“It’s literally after school and public school programs,” Towns said. “That has a stronger homicide reduction rate than policing does. I’m not saying there’s not a role for policing. I’m saying that actually, factually, in evidence, has a stronger return than sleeping in prison.”
The next Project Prison Reset meeting is June 3 in Pierre.

Toddlers lobby for Diaper Bank funding
The tiniest lobbyists had a heavy task, trying to get the appropriation for diapers more than doubled after the Lamont administration and legislature’s Appropriations Committee have finished versions of the state budget.The Diaper Bank of Connecticut, which provides diapers to Medicaid-eligible families, was not hesitant to play the cute card Thursday, having toddlers at the state Capitol as they lobby for more money.This is the time of year when some legislators, overwhelmed by the requests for money, ofttimes for needs they would love to meet, are tempted to walk by the throngs of advocates with eyes fixed on some distant point. Hence, the mini-lobbyists, as well as robocalling using kids, to see if the $756,000 in the budget for diapers just might get bumped to, say, maybe $2 million?Janet Stolfi Alfano of the Diaper Bank said she knows that some lawmakers might rank diapers behind even more basic needs like housing and food. “We don’t fit nicely into one of those buckets,” she said.But she points to Yale research that found a top source of maternal stress was the availability and affordability of diapers, which she found shocking. “We knew it was significant,” she said.The Diaper Bank is 20 years old, founded in 2004 after a social worker saw the need and some families who tried to the stretch the supply in ways potential harmful to the babies. The state put $150,000 in the budget in 2007, then nothing in 2008, when the bottom fell out of the economy and state finances. They’ve received hundreds of thousands since then each year, but it’s not enough to serve the need.“As of now, we’re $756,000 a year, and we’re serving about 6,000 kids with that. But we know there’s about 70,000” more who could qualify using Medicaid eligibility as a standard, she said.Efforts to make it covered by Medicaid have not gone anywhere. “While we’re glad it wasn’t cut, we know that we could be serving more families,” she said. “We could scale up very easily.”— Mark Pazniokas, Capitol Bureau Chief
Inspector general transition
Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday that Judge Eliot Prescott would assume the post of inspector general this summer.The office of the Inspector General was created in the 2020 Police Accountability Law, and established in 2021. The inspector general’s role involves investigating deaths of incarcerated individuals in custody and incidents in which people are killed by police officers.Inspector General Robert Devlin, who has held the post since 2021, only brought one single case to trial during his tenure – that of State Trooper Brian North, who was tried for manslaughter after shooting 19-year-old Mubarak Soulemane, who was the subject of a high-speed chase in 2020. North was acquitted in 2024.Devlin said during a press conference Wednesday that the verdict in North’s trial has not changed the way he thinks about the way the office should operate.“The statute’s very clear. If the inspector general determines that that shooting is not justified, we’re to bring it to court and present that case, and the fair-minded jurors in our state will make a decision about it. So it hasn’t changed my view of that at all,” said Devlin.Lamont emphasized the importance of the inspector general’s role in establishing trust between the community and law enforcement. Prescott said he believed that if cases in which law enforcement found itself at odds with the public were handled fairly, it could lessen the controversy that surrounded them.There are currently over 20 investigations pending in the inspector general’s office. The most recent report addresses a death while in the custody of the Wolcott Police Department that dates back to October 2023.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Lamont talks transportation funding
The few hundred state transportation officials gathered in Hartford had an assortment of projects to ooh and ahh at: a newly-renovated State Pier, a well-regarded bus rapid-transit system and, of course, lots of highway construction.The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials — led this year by Connecticut’s own transportation commissioner, Garrett Eucalitto — held its spring conference at the Connecticut Convention Center this week.On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont stopped by to deliver a keynote speech praising Eucalitto’s work and the federal money that is funding much of it.“As Garrett and I go around the state, we’re christening bridges that are being replaced — a lot of movable bridges were built by William McKinley, Donald Trump’s favorite president,” Lamont joked. “We’re retrofitting, rebuilding and getting those going again.”Lamont’s general message of optimism was tempered somewhat, however, when he cautioned the federal government — and by extension the Trump administration — not to be “spasmodic” about how they dole out money for transportation projects.Under the Biden administration, Connecticut was pledged billions of dollars to upgrade its aging rail and highway infrastructure. Lamont has previously raised concerns that Trump could seek to halt some of that funding, leaving behind a string of unfinished projects.So far at least, Lamont said that appears not to be the case. “The money that was promised to us seems to be flowing,” he told a reporter outside the convention hall, along with a small overture to the president.“I’d like to think that President Trump’s a builder, he knows how important infrastructure was in and around his buildings ” Lamont said. “He was there knocking the doors of probably some AASHTO guys, saying, ‘I need this to keep my building going.’”— John Moritz, Environment & Energy reporter
Shark-finning ban passes House
State lawmakers looking to crack down on any potential for “shark finning” in Connecticut waters voted to advance a statewide ban on Tuesday.Shark finning refers to the practice — already prohibited under federal law — of catching a shark, removing its fins and dumping the rest of the animal’s body back in the ocean.Because their fins are valued as a delicacy in certain overseas markets, sharks have become subject to overfishing that has put some species at the risk of extinction, according to the World Wildlife Fund.House Bill 5012 attempts to close what some lawmakers have referred to as a ‘loophole’ in the state and federal protections for sharks by banning the possession of a dismembered shark fin in Connecticut. The ban would not prohibit anglers from catching sharks if they intend to use the whole body.Even without a ban, the practice does not appear to be widespread in Connecticut. A review of the bill by the nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated that the state would collect less than $500 in fines each year as a result of a ban.The bill passed the House unanimously on Tuesday and now heads to the Senate for further consideration.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter
Working group on poverty
Lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted Wednesday evening to create a working group to study ways to alleviate poverty in the state of Connecticut.Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, told lawmakers that the working group would focus on things like  universal basic income, targeted workforce training, and creating methods for “ measurable economic mobility” for the most disadvantaged.According to the most recent report from United Way, 11% of Connecticut residents live below the poverty line, and 40% live below the ALICE threshold – a measurement of the basic cost of living in a geographic area.The bill was met with pushback from Republicans, several of whom said that Connecticut already offered many programs to help residents. “We provide SNAP money, WIC money, diaper care, health care, dental care, housing, supplements, baby bonds, college supplements … and the list goes on and on and on. I would argue that we have done so much to look at poverty and we’re already doing much, much more than probably many of the states around us,” said Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly.Several Republicans also objected to the idea of introducing a Universal Basic Income proposal. “So we’re going to tax you, member of the state, and then we’re just going to give you a cash payment right back. Seems like a whole waste of time. Let the person keep the cash in the first place,” said Rep. Joe Canino, R-Torrington.Democrats pushed back. Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, noted that the high cost of things like health care, transportation and child care weigh particularly on low-income families.“My soup kitchen in my district hands out about a million meals a year. That’s not SNAP. That’s because SNAP doesn’t cover it all,” added Rep. Susan Johnson, D-Windham.The bill passed 110-37.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Senate passes higher ed scholarship bill
Senate Bill 5, one of the Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee’s top priority bills, passed out of the Senate Wednesday.The bill targeted better enforcement of the Roberta B. Willis Scholarship Program, a need-based and merit-based scholarship that provides Connecticut students between $4,500 and $5,200 to attend in-state higher education institutions.In February, lawmakers said about two-thirds of the students, or around 16,000, who qualified for the scholarship did not receive funds in FY22. The proposed bill would require that need-based grants equal to $4,500 per student are fully funded and for the Office of Higher Education to notify universities of the amount of scholarship money they can expect for the following fiscal year.Senate Democrats said the provisions would “help students weigh the benefits of enrolling in-state accurately.”“The cost of higher education continues to grow, and our underfunded state scholarship program encourages students to seek education elsewhere,” said Senate President Martin Looney in a news release following the bill’s passage. “By investing in our students and giving them timely notice of the amount of their Roberta Willis grants, we are allowing Connecticut students to stay in this state to receive their education, enter the workforce, grow our economy and enjoy the high quality life we have built here in Connecticut.”The bill passed unanimously.— Jessika Harkay, Education Reporter
Student mental health bill passed by House
A bill meant to ensure more seamless communication between medical providers and schools regarding students’ mental health passed out of the state House of Representatives Thursday 105-42. 
House Bill 7158 would require health care providers to share “safety plans” with schools for students who spend 12 or more days in a hospital for behavioral health concerns. The plans, which would consist of things like coping strategies and other recommendations to support the child, would only be shared with school counselors, nurses or other staff who would need the information to keep the child safe in class. The plans would be shared through a secure messaging system provided by the Office of Health Strategy, according to the bill.Currently, safety plans can only be shared if a parent brings a physical copy to the school, said Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-East Hartford, who proposed the bill.“This allows a way for the hospitals to communicate directly to school, which will make the second communication a little bit quicker,” Biggins said. “If the safety plan is shared with the school, then they would have knowledge of the steps to take in order to keep the child safe.”— Jessika Harkay, Education Reporter
Bill aims to help towns reduce blight
The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill that would allow towns to put liens on properties where code violation fees have gone unpaid.Senate Bill 1317 is the latest attempt from the Connecticut legislature to give towns more tools to combat poor rental housing conditions and reduce blight. Connecticut tenants, particularly those with out-of-state landlords, have long said they struggle to get repairs done and are living in unsafe housing conditions.The New Haven delegation issued a press release in support of the bill after its passage. “When housing density is high, it only takes a few violations to impact entire neighborhoods,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, in the release. “This bill empowers New Haven and other cities to take necessary actions to uphold housing standards and protect public spaces.”The bill passed with bipartisan support and next heads to the House for a vote.— Ginny Monk, Housing & Children’s Issues Reporter
Measure prevents discrimination against abuse victims
A bill regarding victims of human trafficking and sexual assault passed in the House 139-4 on Thursday.The bill prohibits current or prospective employers and landlords from discriminating against victims of rape, sexual assault or human trafficking. Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, said victims of rape, sexual assault or human trafficking cannot be penalized by their employer if they have to take time off work to attend court proceedings.But Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, questioned why these protections did not extend to all victims – for example, if someone had their car stolen and was unable to get to work.Fishbein also objected to the idea of an “affirmative defense” for human trafficking victims who commit misdemeanors directly related to being trafficked.Stafstrom gave the example of someone who was a victim of human trafficking and ended up prostituting themselves. “It’s a crime. It’s a misdemeanor offense to engage in prostitution. But they did so because they were trafficked here from out of state, and essentially sold into committing that particular crime,” said Stafstrom.But Fishbein said he didn’t feel that misdemeanors were only small crimes, adding that negligent homicide was considered a misdemeanor. “I’m concerned that someone is going to admit that they killed someone and make this claim of human trafficking, which may be very difficult to prove,” said Fishbein.Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, said she felt the need to disclose to a landlord or an employer that a victim had been sexually assaulted or raped in order to be protected from discrimination was “revictimizing” the person, and noted that victims of sexual assault were still victims even if they chose not to press charges or to discuss what happened to them.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Bear hunt is back
A controversial proposal to allow bear hunting in Connecticut was resurrected on Thursday, more than a month after being left for dead by state lawmakers.In March, members of the legislature’s Environment Committee stripped language from Senate Bill 1523 that would have allowed the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to establish a hunting season for black bears, whose numbers have risen to an estimated 1,000 to 1,200 animals in the state.When the bill appeared Thursday on the Senate floor, however, it came with an amendment adding the hunting language back in. The bill’s sponsor, state Rep. Rick Lopes, D-New Britain, said the bill would leave it up to DEEP and the governor’s office to determine whether a hunt is necessary to address a growing number of conflicts with bears.“At the point that if they feel that human-bear conflicts have risen to a level that endangers public safety they could start… to look into a hunt,” he said.Opponents of a hunt said they were surprised by the sudden change in the bill. “There was no warning that this was being done,” said Lori Brown, the executive director of the League of Conservation Voters. “It’s because it’s so controversial, there’s been so much opposition.”The amended bill passed the Senate on a vote 34 to 2, with senators Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, and Mae Flexer, D-Killingly, voting in opposition. It now heads to the House for further consideration.— John Moritz, Environment & Energy Reporter",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TRUST-ACT-0515_SR-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 20:03:10.357634

Gov. Mike Dunleavy has chosen a new commissioner for the department. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has chosen a state government veteran to be the new commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
Dunleavy announced Thursday that he has selected Randy Bates, a former head of the department’s Division of Water.
“Randy is uniquely suited to assume the role of commissioner-designee for DEC and continue to push my Administration’s agenda to develop our plentiful resources responsibly and to minimize the impacts for all our actions on the environment,” Dunleavy said in a statement.
Bates, in the statement released by Dunleavy, said he is honored to be appointed. He also reinforced the governor’s emphasis on resource development.
“My primary goal as commissioner will be to continue the department’s mission of balancing the need for responsible development and preserving Alaska’s pristine lands and waters and wildlife,” Bates said in the statement.
Prior to serving as director of DEC’s Division of Water, Bates was director of the Division of Habitat at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He also fishes commercially in Southeast Alaska.
Bates replaces Acting Commissioner Christina Carpenter, who has been in that role since January, when former DEC Commissioner Emma Pokon was appointed as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Pacific Northwest regional administrator.
Carpenter is moving to a new job outside of state government but will remain at the department as deputy commissioner through the end of the month to help with the transition, Dunleavy said.  
Bates’ appointment is subject to confirmation by the Legislature. Since the Legislature held its annual confirmation joint session on Wednesday, it will be nearly a year before it votes on Bates.

Jim Pillen signs off on the 2024 general election results on Monday, Dec. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — It’s not every day that Nebraska’s three branches of government are all involved in a single topic. But one issue is front and center within the next week: medical cannabis.
Days before legislative debate and a Lincoln court hearing, Gov. Jim Pillen on Friday announced “intentions” for executive branch staff to offer available administrative support and resources for voter-approved medical cannabis regulators to begin their work.
“With support from the Policy Research Office, the Department of Administrative Services and other agencies, as necessary, the Medical Cannabis Commission is fully enabled to meet and carry out its responsibilities under the Patient Protection Act and the Regulation Act to meet its milestone dates of July 1 [for regulations] and October 1 [for licensing],” the release said.
Any regulations proposed by the commission would need to go through the attorney general and the governor.
  State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair kneels to talk with State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue. Hansen is the lead sponsor on a 2025 bill to help give structure to the state’s new medical cannabis laws.

State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, whose Legislative Bill 677 seeks to clarify and place additional guardrails, confirmed he will still push forward with the legislation and was “a little surprised” by an executive about-face that now seeks to “unilaterally” enact regulations.
He said he sees LB 677 as the Legislature’s responsibility to act and set parameters for regulators that “can’t be changed at a whim.”
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that is mulling medical cannabis legislation, said the executive action diminishes Hansen’s previous argument that the laws could be the “wild west” if the Legislature doesn’t provide more guidance. 
“I think there’s actually been some thought into establishing the cannabis control commission. It’s not a bad thing,” Holdcroft told the Nebraska Examiner on Friday.
But Hansen, in response, said: “I’m not worried about the ‘wild west’ anymore. I’m worried about nothing happening, and then we have recreational cannabis in two years.”
He cites voters who have said that if the regulations are too restrictive, they will push a 2026 ballot measure for recreational marijuana, including some voters who prefer only medical use.
Appointees will follow ‘letter of the law’
Hansen adds that part of the reason LB 677 is still needed is Pillen’s two at-large “potential” appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. Together, they would join the three commissioners pulling double duty on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission to create the new entity, which voters approved in November.

Pillen has appointed Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Omaha, the prevention director at Heartland Family Service, which focuses on drug prevention. Both have consistently opposed efforts pushed by the Nebraskans who prevailed at the ballot box last fall after more than a decade of advocacy.

Still, Pillen said that Oldenburg and Mueting are “experienced, well-qualified individuals” who will ensure strong regulations “to the letter of the law the people of Nebraska enacted.”
“I urge the Legislature to promptly confirm them so they can take up the urgent work of writing strong and effective ‘rules of the road’ for the medical cannabis industry,” Pillen said Friday.
Both Oldenburg and Mueting opposed the closest legislative attempt to legalize medical cannabis in 2021, LB 474, led by former State Sen. Anna Wishart of Lincoln, who later helped the ballot measures. The 2021 bill fell two votes short, 31-18.
‘Other motives may be at play’
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said Friday that while supporters appreciated Pillen’s actions, it is “disingenuous” to characterize the new appointments as “experienced” or “well-qualified.”
“Appointing regulators who are fundamentally opposed to the very issue they are charged with overseeing suggests that other motives may be at play — motives that appear misaligned with the public intent, and not to mention the will of 71% of the state,” Eggers said in a statement.
The legalization position passed with 71% of the vote, while the regulatory measure trailed just slightly, with about 67% support. Eggers and other long-time advocates support LB 677 as an initial step for regulations.
At a March hearing on four medical cannabis bills, Mueting opposed LB 677 and two very similar bills and was “neutral” on the narrowest bill: LB 483, from State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, seeking to limit medical cannabis to tinctures or pills alone. LB 483 sought to legalize up to 300 milligrams, 0.21% of the 5 ounces that voters approved.
Both appointees will go before the General Affairs Committee next Thursday for confirmation hearings before the full Legislature weighs in.

Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen, said the office interviewed three people and selected two. A staff member who oversees application materials for appointees was out of the office Friday, so the materials for Oldenburg and Mueting were not immediately made available.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the General Affairs Committee, said he looks forward to the confirmation hearings but is “skeptical” of Pillen’s sincerity in helping voters.
“I will keep an open mind, but any attempt to restrict what the voters passed through bureaucratic red tape should be opposed vigorously,” Cavanaugh said in a text. “In the meantime, the Legislature should pass LB 677 to make sure that medical cannabis is legal, safe and accessible in Nebraska.”
Unclear executive branch funding
Part of Pillen’s Friday announcement mentions “operational funding” already appropriated to the Medical Cannabis Commission, but when the next two-year state budget passed Thursday, new funding was limited.
The Appropriations Committee offered an annual $30,000 each of the next two fiscal years for employees in the Liquor Control Commission, who take on additional duties under the new laws. In comparison, the Liquor Control Commission has a $2 million annual budget, including for enforcement of regulations for compliance.
There is no additional funding for the remaining two months of the current fiscal year. 
The Department of Administrative Services can provide limited financial support to agencies crafting regulations, but the Governor’s Office could not immediately provide specifics.
Legislative and legal fights await
Hansen’s LB 677 is expected to be filibustered at each stage of debate, at a maximum of eight hours on Tuesday. If so, it would require 33 votes to advance and become law at the end.

Hansen said that considering Oldenburg and Mueting are “both openly staunch anti-medical cannabis people, you can only assume the direction on maybe where they’re going to go with the implementation of this.”
“If we don’t do anything, we have no idea what to expect,” Hansen said.
Holdcroft said he would support Hansen and LB 677 by arguing in favor of a “compromise” amendment to the bill, which gives an extra three months for regulations, prohibits smoking and outlines qualifying conditions.
Pillen previously told the Examiner that cannabis wouldn’t be approved in a form that could become recreational.
“My advocacy for it is that if you have a medical condition [and] you need it, you’ll get it, but it’s going to taste like crap,” Pillen said last month. “It’s going to be a bitter pill to swallow.”
‘Effectively do business’
Also on Tuesday, Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong will consider oral arguments on whether to dismiss a lawsuit that argues the voter-approved medical cannabis laws are unconstitutional because of federal laws outlawing marijuana.

Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, whose office is defending Pillen and other state officials, fundamentally opposes medical cannabis. He is asking that the case be dismissed, as are the regulatory commissioners and the ballot measure sponsors.
The reason is specific: Hilgers’ staff argues that the Attorney General’s Office and not a private citizen should be the one to challenge the laws.

(Kenneth Ferriera-Pool/Lincoln Journal Star)
LB 677 also presents a different threat to a pending appeal to the Nebraska Supreme Court, including from Hilgers’ office, alleging signature fraud in the medical cannabis ballot measures. Strong rejected those arguments in November and upheld the ballot measures. The AG’s Office and a former state senator who brought both cases before Strong appealed.
Because LB 677 would provide additional legislative weight to the 2024 ballot measures, Hilgers and other advocates have acknowledged it could nullify or weaken the pending appeal. Hilgers has said he should get a “fair fight” in front of the high court. He has also pledged to sue the new commission if it issues any medical cannabis licenses in the future, too.
With Pillen’s announcement, he joined the likes of Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who have argued that lawmakers should wait and pass no cannabis-related bills this year.
Said Strimple: “Governor Pillen does not believe it is necessary for LB 677 to pass because with existing statutory authority and resources, the Medical Cannabis Commission will have everything it needs to effectively do business.”

Can lawmakers get health care organizations to cut tens of millions in health care expenditures?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers encourage, but don’t require, health facilities to reduce spending.","House Majority Leader Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, seen on the opening day of the Legislature at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Jan. 8. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont policymakers are facing a $200 million question. That’s the amount of spending — according to the Green Mountain Care Board — that the state’s health care system would need to trim in order to keep Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont’s premium increases to around 5% in 2026. It’s a big ask, and a short timeline. Earlier this week, Blue Cross Blue Shield issued its proposed premium increases for 2026: 13.7% for small group plans and 23.3% for individual ones. Without significant cost savings within the next few months, those numbers will likely stand. Lawmakers are working on several measures intended to lower health care costs. But many of those initiatives — such as reference-based pricing, a system that caps how much hospitals can charge for procedures and a bill to reduce the cost of building or renovating facilities — are years away from bearing fruit.Earlier this month, Rep. Lori Houghton, D-Essex Junction, introduced an amendment to a large bill, S.126, intended to trim spending in Vermont’s teetering health care system more quickly. The initial amendment, dated May 2, would have required the Agency of Human Services to “coordinate efforts by hospitals” to cut Vermont hospital spending by 10% in their fiscal year 2026, which begins Oct. 1.By the next week, the language had been softened: the agency would “facilitate collaboration and coordination” to help providers “identify opportunities” to improve health care services and reduce spending by 5%.A day later, lawmakers trimmed that savings goal further: to just 2.5%. That figure still stands in the most recent version of the bill, which was advanced by the House Appropriations Committee Friday afternoon. In an interview last week, Houghton said the initial goal of a 10% reduction in health care spending would have actually added up to $400 million — twice the number the Green Mountain Care Board asked for. So lawmakers trimmed it to 5%, which comes out to $200 million. “Then for various reasons — of just people not (being) happy, and not sure how they can do it — we did move it down to 2.5%,” Houghton said.But whatever the number is, the legislation is not intended to force health care facilities to cut spending: “There’s no mandate,” Houghton said. “Lots of times when we pass legislation, it is the intent that’s important, right?” she said. “And it’s also the fact that we need Vermonters to see that we’re all trying to find a solution to this really immediate problem.”— Peter D’AuriaIn the knowVermont is on track to join a growing list of states that have banned smartphones from the classroom.This week, lawmakers in a key committee advanced legislation that would require all of the state’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students from using smartphones and other personal devices like smartwatches during the school day. The policies would need to take effect by the 2026-2027 school year.A school cell phone ban was previously introduced in a standalone bill that has failed to move forward this legislative session. But on Thursday members of the Senate Committee on Education voted to graft the ban onto H.480, a miscellaneous education bill that includes several smaller adjustments to Vermont’s education laws. Now, with broad support in both chambers, lawmakers hope to send the bill to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of the session. Read more about the new bill language here. — Habib SabetGov. Phil Scott has issued his third veto of the session, rejecting H.219, a bill that would require the Department of Corrections to roll out a program providing free family support services to incarcerated parents and guardians across state prisons. (Scott also vetoed two versions of the fiscal year 2025 budget adjustment bill.)Scott wrote in a letter explaining his decision Thursday that he supported the bill’s intent but not specific language within it that would require his administration to put funding for the program in future budget proposals to the Legislature. Such a requirement violates the state Constitution, he said.The veto may not matter much, though, since funding to run programs for incarcerated parents at two state prisons has already been included in the 2026 budget bill, which the House and Senate both approved this week. Scott supports that funding, too, he said in his veto letter.Rep. Troy Headrick, a Burlington Independent who sponsored H.219, said in an interview Friday that Scott has also expressed support for legislators’ intent, also laid out in the bill, to have the administration expand the program to all state prisons by 2028. Legislators may rework some of the language that Scott opposed in H.219 in the remaining weeks of this year’s session, Headrick said, or could take the legislation up again at the start of next year’s session. — Shaun RobinsonOn the moveA key Senate committee advanced the Legislature’s landmark education bill Thursday, but not before nearly every committee member vented their discomfort with the legislation. “I can’t remember ever feeling as bad about a vote as I do on this one, but it will move us forward,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, the Senate Finance Committee’s chair, told her colleagues after voting out H.454. The bill proposes generational changes to Vermont’s school governance and finance systems that would phase in over multiple years, including school district consolidation and a new education funding formula, but leaves open some key decision points for the future. Read more about the Senate’s version of the education reform bill here. — Ethan WeinsteinThe Senate on Friday passed H.1, a bill that would eliminate a requirement from state law that the Legislature’s two internal ethics panels consult with the State Ethics Commission over cases in which lawmakers are accused of potential misconduct. Legislators have argued that the consultation requirement, part of a sweeping set of changes to state ethics laws enacted in 2024, infringed on the separation of powers guaranteed in the state Constitution. But the proposal has drawn repeated opposition from the Ethics Commission, which argued it could be the start of a slippery slope of reneging on last year’s accountability measures.The bill will now head back to the House to consider the Senate’s changes.— Shaun RobinsonVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Lawmakers encourage, but don’t require, health facilities to reduce spending.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lori-houghton-1-20250108-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 19:05:51.346194

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order Friday that pushes local governments to comply with certain state housing laws as a condition of receiving state grant funding. 
The order directs several state agencies to identify funding opportunities that can be prioritized for local governments and projects that align with state housing priorities. It highlights seven state laws passed in the last two years that aim to increase housing options across the state.
Polis said the goal of the executive order is to ensure those who receive discretionary grant funding from the state are prioritizing state efforts to increase housing stock, affordability and sustainability. He estimated over $100 million dollars in state funding will be subject to the order.

“Today we’re taking action to make sure that the limited state funding opportunities are prioritized for local governments that are following state housing laws and land use laws and doing their part so hardworking Coloradans to afford to live, work and thrive across our state of Colorado,” Polis said at a press conference in his office at the Colorado Capitol, where he signed the executive order Friday.
While many local governments have supported housing policies approved by the Colorado Legislature in recent years, others opposed the policies and indicated concerns about compliance. Polis said he wants local governments to be able to go through DOLA to help them achieve compliance with new state housing laws. 
“We want to make sure everybody is working in good faith and has a plan to implement these laws,” Polis said. “Some counties have just thought about it and worked on it more than others, and we want to make sure that everybody thinks about it and works on it and gets it done because housing is a statewide issue.”
Laws covered by the executive order include 2024 measures to prohibit residential occupancy limits, require higher-density housing near transit stops, prohibit local minimum parking requirements, legalize the construction of accessory dwelling units, and encourage more sustainable affordable housing, as well as 2025 polices that set regional building codes for factory-built homes and allow some multifamily buildings to have just one staircase.
Housing availability and affordability has been a growing crisis in Colorado that state legislators worked to improve since 2023. A 2023 housing executive order Polis signed said the state is short tens of thousands of housing units, and his new order says the same concerns continue to escalate. 
Some of the laws included in the order are not yet implemented, so the provisions of the executive order will apply after the measures take effect. 
The executive order requires state agencies including the Colorado Department of Transportation, the Colorado Energy Office, the Department of Local Affairs, and the Office of Economic Development and International Trade to submit a list within 30 days of potential competitive grants and other discretionary funding sources that could be subject to the requirements of the order. 
The order will be updated once the governor’s office compiles a list of grants and funding to be included, and it will apply to funding awarded after Oct. 6.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that he will veto the Reparations Commission bill that called for a study of historic inequality endured by African descendants in Maryland.
The veto of a reparations measure by the only sitting Black governor in the nation was included a list of vetoes of bills, many of which called for summer study of an issue, typically the most innocuous type of legislation. The list of 23 bills was released late Friday afternoon by the governor’s office.
Moore’s list also includes a bill in the energy package backed by House and Senate leadership, which created a Strategic Energy Planning Office focused on the state’s energy needs.
Reaction was swift, and in some cases angry, from lawmakers, who were already discussing veto overrides.
“The governor is my friend. I think a lot of him, but I am every disappointed in him today,” said Sen. C. Anthony Muse (D-Prince George’s), who sponsored the Senate version of the reparations bill. “I’m very disappointed that something like this, that Black communities across the country have been asking for, it’s turned down in our state,”
Sponsors began getting the news Friday afternoon of the coming vetoes of their bills. Reparations was the most high-profile bill to be shot down, and chatter was widespread before the official announcement, but others learned of the demise of their bills to study the effects of climate change and to look at the impact of data centers on the state.




List of vetoed bills
Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that he will veto 23 bills passed by the 2025 General Assembly — more than in the previous two years combined, when he vetoed 13 and four, respectively. This year’s vetoes included some high-profile proposals, including a bill to create reparations study commission and another to look at the impact of data centers.

Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) said she got a text from one of the governor’s staffers Friday, alerting her that her bill, originally titled the RENEW Act, was going to be vetoed. The bill would have commissioned a study from the comptroller’s office on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions in the state, and it was a milder alternative to the original language that would have called for a system to make businesses that extract fossil fuels pay fees to mitigate the effects of climate change.
“I think a study is a very reasonable next step, and the money was allocated in the budget,” Hester said. “This is very shortsighted, because this is a bill that will eventually save taxpayers money.”
The bill was to be funded mostly by $500,000 from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by “alternative compliance payments”  utilities pay when they have not purchased enough renewable energy to comply with state mandates. That fund has burgeoned in recent years with an influx of payments, including $318 million in fiscal 2024.
Advocates were angered by the move. Mike Tidwell, founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the governor’s veto of the RENEW study “unforgiveable.”
“I will make sure that voters in the state never forget what he’s done with this veto,” Tidwell said, adding that the governor’s office expressed no reservations about the bill as recently as mid-March.
The veto was “inconceivable,” given that Maryland has thousands of miles of shoreline vulnerable to climate change, and the $500,000 study could have paved the way toward tens of millions of dollars in compensatory payments from fossil fuel companies, Tidwell said.

“His math doesn’t add up. His political calculus is arguably even worse, because turning his back on Marylanders suffering from climate change today is an enormously politically damaging act,” Tidwell said.
Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) said she heard from the governor’s team Friday that her bill, studying the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland would be among the vetoes. In Frederick, development of an expansive Quantum Loophole campus has been underway for years, prompting Lewis Young’s interest in the subject.
“I’m really disappointed that, given what a big topic this is for the state — and in particular for my county — that we wouldn’t proceed with a study,” Lewis Young said.
Lewis Young said she was surprised to learn of the veto, especially given that the governor’s team did not express any reservations about the bill or its cost during the legislative session. The report was to cost about $502,000, with funds pulled from the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Maryland Energy Administration and the University System of Maryland, according to its fiscal note.
More economical still was the reparations bill: Versions that failed in previous years had price tags around $1 million, but the version on the governor’s desk this year was only expected to cost $54,500. The will called for most of the work to be one by existing state employees or by researches at Bowie State University, one of the state’s historically black colleges and universities.
The bill’s supporters have pointed out repeatedly that the bill does not require any payments or support. It only calls for study of historic inequality suffered by African descendants, and recommendations for future action, if any.
“It’s not as though it was going to do something. It’s a study,” Muse said Friday evening. “When have we known a study to cause a veto? At the end of the study, nothing else has been done, except we studied it. I don’t understand it. I will not understand it.”
Advocates rallied in Annapolis a week ago, urging the governor to sign the bill, which had the backing of the Legislative Black Caucus. The caucus released a statement to express “deep disappointment” in the governor’s decision and that the “legislature will have a final say” when lawmakers meet to consider veto overrides.
“At a time when the White House and Congress are actively targeting Black communities, dismantling diversity initiatives and using harmful coded language, Governor Moore had a chance to show the country and the world that here in Maryland we boldly and courageously recognize our painful history and the urgent need to address it,” the caucus said in a statement Friday evening.
“Instead, the State’s first Black governor chose to block this historic legislation that would have moved the state toward directly repairing the harm of enslavement,” the statement said.
The bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also have examined how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs.
The 24-member commission would have had to deliver a preliminary report of recommendations by Jan. 1, 2027, to explain any findings, and a final report by Nov. 1 of that year.

State health officials alerted the public that they could have been exposed to the virus at a Trader Joe’s in Albuquerque, along with a big medical center in Rio Rancho. 
As of Friday, there are 74 confirmed cases across New Mexico, state health officials told Source New Mexico. 
In addition to providing daily updates on the virus’ spread, health officials also provide dates, times and locations where people may have been exposed, along with a list of places where people can walk in to receive vaccines. 

Read all of Source’s measles coverage here. 

Infected people have been in a Denny’s in Hobbs, a school gym in Lovington, a preschool in Las Cruces and various medical clinics in southern and northern New Mexico in recent months. 
Measles symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness, before progressing to fever and rash that starts at the head before moving down the body. Health officials advise that people who have measles can infect others from four days before the rash appears and remain contagious four days after the rash is gone.
In addition to Sandoval County, New Mexico has now seen confirmed cases in Chaves, Curry, Doña Ana, Eddy and Lea counties. Currently, more than 1,000 measles cases have been reported nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The health department encourages people with symptoms who have been exposed to measles to call NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for guidance in English and Spanish. If planning to see a doctor or visit an emergency room, call first so health care providers can plan for a visit by someone who may have measles.

The change from the federal agency does not affect the state’s efforts to continue work already underway to reduce levels of PFAS at contaminated sites, the state’s director of drinking water regulation said. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont officials reevaluate new state standards for toxic forever chemicals as EPA eases stance.","Stock photo by Nithin PA via PexelsVermont environmental officials are pausing to reevaluate a stricter state standard for certain harmful forever chemicals after a change in stance by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this week. Barely one year after the EPA passed historic rules to reduce the amounts of certain harmful forever chemicals in drinking water, the agency is now considering reversing some of those regulations and pushing back the timeline for drinking water systems to comply with others.When the set of federal regulations passed under President Joe Biden, they set allowable levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, even lower than Vermont’s existing standards, which had been in place for five years. The stricter rules meant an additional 30 drinking water suppliers in the state needed to remove PFAS.  Now, the state’s progress on formalizing those rules is on something of a pause, as officials wait to hear more information about the federal decision.“The amount of information we have as a state, is about the same as what the public has been receiving,” said Bryan Redmond, the director of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Protection Division in the state Department of Environmental Conservation. “We are waiting to schedule some time with the EPA to learn what the details of this mean.” Wednesday’s announcement from the EPA keeps the Biden-area levels for two chemicals in the sprawling PFAS family. There can be only 4 parts per trillion or less of PFOA and PFOS chemicals detected in drinking water. However, the agency has now added two more years on the deadline for meeting those levels — meaning municipalities now have to comply by 2031, instead of 2029. The agency is also announcing a federal exemption framework for some communities struggling to remove the harmful chemicals from drinking water.The existing rules had also set a limit of 10 parts per trillion of four other types of PFAS chemicals. The EPA announced it now intends to rescind and reconsider the regulations for those other four regulated chemicals. There are more than 12,000 chemicals in this class of compounds.PFOA and PFOS are some of the most commonly occurring compounds in the PFAS family, and those are the two chemicals that typically drive the contamination issues in Vermont, according to Redmond. The chemicals in high doses are linked to a litany of harmful health effects, largely because they are suspected of interrupting hormone chemical signaling in the body, and thus can lead to a range of maladies, from cancers and reproductive health problems to cardiovascular challenges and weakened immune systems. Redmond said the next step for the state is to evaluate the EPA actions, taking thorough account of the science, the health impacts and technical details of PFAS removal. “It’s possible to move forward with the existing standards,” he said. “It’s possible that we adopt the EPA standards, or it’s possible we do a hybrid.”Regardless, the language in the draft state rule surrounding this will have to change since it references and rests on the EPA’s standards, he said. The state is “mid-stream” in that rulemaking process, but it’s been paused due to all the uncertainty from the federal agency. This, at least, Redmond said, is a “push toward certainty,” so the state can figure out how it wants to act in response. What the federal change does not influence is the state’s progress toward remediating existing drinking water systems known to be contaminated by PFAS. “Regardless of regulation, we have been remediating down to the 4 (parts per trillion) level,” Redmond said Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Vermont was allocated five years of funding to carry out the remediation process for impacted systems. Money has been appropriated for the third year of work, Redmond said, and he expects the state will receive that soon. Disclosure: Bryan Redmond is married to VTDigger CEO Sky Barsch.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont officials reevaluate new state standards for toxic forever chemicals as EPA eases stance.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pexels-nithin-pa-2583028-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

Greg Gianforte signed two laws geared at making travel safer for both motorists and pedestrians at crossings earlier this month.
Senate Bill 471 seeks to make pedestrian crossings safer, while Senate Bill 428 makes it easier for counties to change speed limits. Senate Democrats brought both bills, which passed through the House and Senate by comfortable margins.
Sen. Dave Fern brought SB 471, which introduces a new offense into Montana code — endangerment of pedestrians to clarify who has right-of-way.
“I think it basically sets up some clearly defined rules for the pedestrian and for the driver,” Fern said during a Senate hearing for the bill. “And it sets up, I think, pretty reasonable system of fines.”
The legislation added specific language for crosswalks with flashing lights, which the new law covers. If a pedestrian has already engaged the button to begin flashing the lights, a driver may not move through the intersection.
However, if the vehicle reaches a pedestrian crossing before the light is engaged, they are allowed to drive through the intersection.
The misdemeanor offense carries an initial fine between $25 and $100. Subsequent offenses carry higher penalties. If a person hits one of the beacons, or crosswalk devices, they are also now liable for the damage to them.
SB 428 gives county governments increased ability to control speed limits on roads, dropping the minimum speed they can set to 25 mph, down from the previous minimum of 35 mph. The law allows for greater control in areas classified as urban districts.
Sen. Willis Curdy, who brought the legislation, called it a safety issue. He also said some counties had been pressured into changing speed limits outside of what state law allowed them to do.
“Outside of the legislative session, a vast majority of complaints and questions my constituents have is that people are driving too fast and the county should lower the speed limits,” Curdy said during a Senate hearing for the bill. “I sympathize 100%, but I remind them that state law does not permit the county to lower the speed limit under 35 mph. Senate Bill 428 will allow counties the opportunity to make that adjustment.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte has also signed a swath of other transportation bills, including SB 433 from Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton which changed right-of-way law in roundabouts. He also signed HB 764, a change in public transportation law that could expand municipal bus routes further.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4954-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

Jared Polis vetoed a bill on Friday afternoon that would have repealed​ a requirement for a second election to form a union, a provision that’s unique to the state.
The veto was expected, as Polis, a Democrat, said from the start of the 2025 state legislative session that he wanted to see a compromise between labor and business interests over the issue. That never came.
Senate Bill 25-5 would have repealed the state requirement for a second election following a simple majority vote, per federal law, to form a union. The second vote requires 75% approval for workers to be able to negotiate whether every employee must pay into representation fees, regardless of union membership. Colorado is the only state to have that system. It was created through the Labor Peace Act over 80 years ago.
“I believe there must be a high threshold of worker participation and approval to allow for bargaining over mandatory wage deduction. And SB 25-005 does not satisfy that threshold, which is why I am vetoing the bill,” Polis wrote in his veto letter. “Nonetheless, I was and remain open to changes to the Labor Peace Act. The law can and should be amended to more fairly allow workers to choose union security.”

Polis wrote that the current system makes it easier to fully unionize at smaller companies than at larger ones “where organizing might be even more important.” He encouraged labor and business leaders to continue conversations about how to update the law.
“This two election framework makes Colorado a unique ‘hybrid,’ allowing for union security unlike ‘open shop’ states, but requiring a high threshold of approval to achieve it. I am disappointed we did not find common ground that would have resulted in me signing an updated and fairer Labor Peace Act,” he wrote.
The bill was a priority for labor groups and progressive Democrats in the Legislature this year. It passed on party-line votes in both chambers, which Democrats control by wide margins.
“This veto from Governor Polis is a betrayal of working people in Colorado, but also one we are not surprised about,” Wynn Howell, Colorado Working Families Party state director, said in a statement after the veto. “Given that he is one of the wealthiest men in Colorado, it is no shock that he is woefully out of touch with public opinion on this question.”
Howell called on Attorney General Phil Weiser and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, two Democrats in the race for Colorado governor next year, to weigh in on whether they would have signed the bill.
“Will Senator Bennet or AG Weiser stand with workers? Or will they just be more of the same stale and out of touch anti-worker politics in Colorado? Neither one has said publicly whether they would sign the Worker Protection Act, and at this point their silence is deafening. We urge them to answer that question clearly and unambiguously,” they wrote.
Business groups applauded the veto.
“CCA members value the voice of their employees,” Colorado Contractors Association President and CEO Tony Milo said in a statement. “It is of utmost importance to ensure their voices count when it comes to deducting union dues from their paychecks. The Governor did the right thing today for workers across Colorado.”

(Kate Kealey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)TOPEKA — Fuel shortages in Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska spurred a federal agency to issue an emergency declaration this week that gives leeway to commercial drivers hauling fuel.
The emergency order by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Association extended an April 30 state of disaster emergency proclamation from Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly. The state-level declaration expired on May 13, said Linda Berry, spokesperson for the Kansas Corporation Commission, which regulates gas and oil production in the state.
Areas in Kansas and surrounding states are experiencing a fuel shortage, causing long lines at fuel stations, delivery delays and a need for truck drivers to increase the number of hours they can drive to deliver fuel, said an April 30 press release. The short-term changes only apply to drivers who are part of the fuel delivery system.
Under the declaration, drivers can temporarily work longer hours to ensure fuel supplies are going through, the release said.
“This declaration is in response to the widespread fuel shortages in affected states impacting agricultural operations and the national food supply, and their effects on people and property, including immediate threats to human life, public safety, or public welfare,” the federal declaration said.
Berry said planned pipeline and refinery maintenance and higher demands among farmers and drivers during planting season were likely sources of the supply chain disruption.

(Photo by Diyosa Carter/Getty Images)A federal judge has again temporarily blocked portions of an Iowa law aimed at restricting schools’ recognition of LGBTQ+ people and banning books with sexual or LGBTQ+ content.
The law, which was signed by Gov. Kim Reynolds in May 2023, was immediately challenged by Lambda Legal and ACLU of Iowa on behalf of students, teachers and the organization Iowa Safe Schools.
As originally written, the law prohibits school districts and educators from providing “any program, curriculum, test, survey, questionnaire, promotion, or instruction relating to gender identity or sexual orientation to students in kindergarten through grade six.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The court had previously enjoined the law because the terms “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” were defined so broadly as to make it impossible for a reasonable school district, teacher, or student to understand what, exactly, was prohibited.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated the district court’s injunction and remanded the case with instructions to the district court to address the legality of a narrower interpretation of the law.
Thursday’s preliminary injunction reflects the district court’s conclusion that there are parts of the law that do pass constitutional muster, but only under such a narrow interpretation.
“The restrictions on ‘programs’ and ‘promotion’ relating to gender identity and sexual orientation cannot reasonably be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment,” U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher ruled. “The words ‘program’ and ‘promotion’ are simply too broad to refer only to mandatory classroom curriculum and instead prohibit school districts and educators from, among other things, making extracurricular activities relating to gender identity and sexual orientation available to students in grade 6 or below. These restrictions therefore violate students’ First Amendment rights and are facially unconstitutional.”
In his ruling, Locher set out what precisely what portions of the law are, and are not, enforceable:
— Detailed instruction banned: School districts and educators may not provide mandatory lessons or instruction to students in grade 6 or below that include detailed explanations or normative views on “gender identity” or “sexual orientation.”
— Neutral references allowed: School districts and teachers may provide mandatory lessons or instruction to students in grade 6 or below that contain neutral references to gender identity or sexual orientation. The lessons and instruction simply cannot focus on those topics. Teachers may make other neutral references to any gender identity and any sexual orientation during classroom instruction — for example, by referring to their partner even if the individual is of the same sex.
— Student groups allowed: Students in grades 6 and below must be allowed to join Gender Sexuality Alliances, or GSAs, and other student groups related to gender identity and/or sexual orientation.
— Promotion of student groups allowed: School districts and educators must be permitted to advertise GSAs and other student groups that relate to gender identity or sexual orientation to all students, including those in grade six and below, to the same degree as they might promote any other student group.
— Parental notification allowed in some cases: State officials and school districts may inform parents when a student asks for an accommodation in the form of a pronoun that’s at odds with their gender listed in school records, but they may not do so to any other student requests for an accommodation.
“We’re pleased that our clients, Iowa families and students, can look forward to the next school year without facing the harms of this unconstitutional law,” said Nathan Maxwell, senior attorney at Lambda Legal. “This ruling acknowledges that Iowa students and teachers have experienced real harm from this law. The court agreed with us that the latitude afforded the state to determine school curricula does not empower lawmakers to erase any mention of LGBTQ+ people altogether from schools, nor to put students in harm’s way for failing to meet ambiguous and arbitrary standards for gender expression. Lastly, the court here makes it clear, yet again, that banning books with LGBTQ+ content or censoring inclusive messages for LGBTQ+ students is unacceptable.”
“This is an important win for our clients and others harmed by this overreaching law,” said Thomas Story, ACLU of Iowa staff attorney. “The federal district court has blocked the state from enforcing many of the worst aspects of Senate File 496. Under this order, Iowa teachers no longer can be disciplined simply because their classroom contains a Pride flag or their library contains books with LGBTQ+ characters. Students of all ages are once again free to join GSAs and to promote them to their classmates.”

Why it’s still controversial,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/05/graduation-regalia-california/,Many school districts require students to undergo a lengthy process if they want to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation. A new bill would eliminate those obstacles.,"In summary
Many school districts require students to undergo a lengthy process if they want to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation. A new bill would eliminate those obstacles.


Eight years ago, California passed a law requiring high schools to allow students to wear eagle feathers, abalone necklaces and other regalia at graduations. 
But so many schools — more than half, by one estimation — have thrown up roadblocks to implementing the law that one lawmaker has brought the issue back to the Legislature. 
“It’s very disappointing that even after all this time, some districts still aren’t compliant,” said Assemblyman James Ramos, a Democrat from San Bernardino, who’s sponsoring the current bill. “We hope this bill gets us where we need to be.”
Ramos’ bill, AB 1369, eliminates the pre-approval process for students seeking to wear any type of cultural regalia at graduations, Native American or otherwise. Fifty-six percent of high schools allow students to wear regalia but only if they get advance permission, sometimes weeks before the ceremony, according to a 2024 study by the American Civil Liberties Union and California Indian Legal Services.
Schools say they need a pre-approval process — for all students, not just Native American students — because they want to ensure graduation adornments are respectful and appropriate. Students of other backgrounds also occasionally opt for adornments, such as kente cloths, and have to undergo the same approval process.

The bill, which passed the Assembly and is now working its way through the Senate, applies to any form of cultural regalia, although its definition of “cultural” is vague: “Cultural means recognized practices and traditions of a certain group of people.” That ambiguity is why a pre-approval process is necessary, some school districts say.
Native students, their families and tribes say it should be their decision as to what’s appropriate tribal attire, not the school district’s. They also say the approval process is too far in advance of the ceremony; often, students receive their regalia on the day of the event, sometimes as a gift from a grandparent or tribal elder. Showing up at graduation unsure of whether you’ll be allowed to wear a cherished piece of regalia can be nerve-wracking and embarrassing, Native students have said.
‘Proud to be Native’
Jennie Rocha, a freshman at Oregon State University, said she was nervous last year when she arrived at her graduation ceremony at Clovis North High wearing a Comanche stole that the school had initially denied.
The stole, provided by the tribal headquarters in Oklahoma, was inscribed with “we the people” in English and Comanche. When Rocha first applied for approval to wear it, she was denied. But after her father complained to the school board and local media reported on the dispute, the school granted approval.      
“I wanted to wear it because I feel like everything I have is because of the Comanche. I wouldn’t be able to go to college without their support,” Rocha said. “I’m proud to be Native and I wanted to show that.” 
Although there may have been delays and initial denials, Clovis Unified hasn’t ultimately stopped a student from wearing cultural adornments at graduation, said district spokesperson Kelly Avants. The district stands by its approval process as a way to minimize disruptions on the day of the graduation and screen out potentially offensive adornments.
Not having an approval process “creates an extremely vulnerable position for school districts and hinders the ability of staff to protect students from the trauma that comes from cultural appropriation, or a situation where someone intending to mock or harm a race or culture is able to do so because school administrators are not allowed to validate adornments,” Avants said in an email.

In Rocha’s case, the district initially denied the request because staff weren’t clear on personal elements of the stole and wanted to check with Comanche tribal leaders, Avants said. That caused a delay before the district ultimately approved the stole, she said.
The Association of California School Administrators hasn’t taken a position on Ramos’ bill, but their attorneys apparently agree with Clovis’ stand. 
“Districts have to have some parameters, otherwise you’re going to end up with a free-for-all on the night of graduation,” attorney Sloan Simmons said in an April podcast advising the state’s school administrators. “That’s the only rational way to handle this.”
The California Department of Education formed a task force to study the issue. The task force was supposed to create a report for the Legislature by April 2023, but it hasn’t yet. Meanwhile, the Department of Education is advising school districts to consult with local tribes if they opt to have a pre-approval process for regalia.
Trump’s anti-DEI orders
Another potential barrier to graduation regalia is President Donald Trump’s announcement in February that the federal government would withhold school funding to districts that have diversity policies and programs, specifically mentioning graduation ceremonies. A judge temporarily blocked the order last month, saying it was overly vague, and California more recently filed a separate lawsuit to stop the order. 
Meanwhile, confusion persists over any school policy that singles out or gives special treatment to a particular ethnic group.
Heather Hostler, executive director of California Indian Legal Services and a member of the Hoopa Valley tribe in Humboldt County, said she’s not worried about Ramos’ bill defying Trump’s order because recognized tribes are sovereign nations over which the federal government has no authority, she said.
The push for tribal regalia started as a way to tout the accomplishments of Native students, whose graduation rate — 80% — lags behind the state average of 87%. It’s also a way to strengthen Native culture by raising awareness and giving Native communities something to rally around, Ramos said.
“When someone graduates, it’s a big deal,” Ramos said. “The whole tribal community comes together. It makes sense that you’d be gifted something for your accomplishment.”
History of discrimination
Other recent laws, many by Ramos, have also addressed the treatment of Native Americans in K-12 schools. One law bans Native American school mascots. Another updates history curriculum to include the genocide of Native Californians. 
These laws are meant to help reverse more than a century of discrimination against Native students in California schools, said Morning Star Gali, founder and executive director of Indigenous Justice, an advocacy group.
Until the 1970s, many Native young people were sent to boarding schools where they were forced to abandon their language and culture. History curriculum often glamorizes the Mission and Gold Rush eras, when Native tribes suffered devastating losses.

In light of that, wearing tribal regalia at graduations “should not be a contentious issue,” Gali said. “Our young people deserve to walk with dignity and pride. To deny them that is a continued form of cultural extermination.”
Ethan Molina, a senior at Clovis West High School and a member of the Pascua Yaqui tribe, got district approval to wear an eagle feather on his mortarboard at graduation next month. The feather was a gift at a recent powwow. 
But he did not get permission to wear a sash embroidered by his aunt for the occasion. The sash reads “Class of 2025,” sewn in burgundy, blue, orange and red, significant colors for the tribe.
“I was confused,” Molina said. “It’s not political or anything. I didn’t really get why they’d deny it.”
His mother complained to the district and they’re waiting to hear a response. Meanwhile, Molina is just eager to graduate.
“I’m happy I get to wear the eagle feather,” he said. “But I’m also pretty excited about leaving school.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425-Native-American-Regalia-LV-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

In a May 9 letter from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Darren Olson, the institute’s grants management officer, said the president determined that the Digital Equity Capacity Program was created and administered using “unconstitutional racial preferences.”The Vermont Community Broadband Board is exploring legal options to oppose the cancellation and has contacted the State Attorney General’s Office, according to its website.“Without targeted investments in digital access and literacy, many Vermonters will be unable to access the resources necessary for job training, career advancement, and economic mobility, ultimately deepening existing disparities and limiting opportunities for economic growth,” the board’s digital equity officer, Britaney Watson, said in the release.Vermont’s implementation of the Digital Equity Act, passed under the Biden administration, would provide devices for people facing financial barriers, as well as online training programs to prepare Vermonters for remote work. The program would have also awarded subgrants to local organizations working to provide internet accessibility throughout the state, according to the release.A Sept. 30th study by the Center on Rural Innovation found that rural areas with higher broadband adoption and more small broadband service providers have stronger, more dynamic local economies. They reported that rural counties with fiber broadband adoption rates of over 80% have significant advantages over those with low adoption, including 213% higher business growth, higher self-employment growth, GDP growth and per capita income growth.The broadband board said in the release that it will continue to work with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office and Vermont’s congressional delegation to determine their next legal, political and programmatic steps in continuing their digital equity efforts. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal government cancels Vermont’s $5.3 million digital equity grant.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/womens-rally-9-20241102-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

It’s the latest move by the gun-rights group in its four-year-battle to override the 2018 Florida law that bans 18-to-20-year-olds from purchasing long guns.
The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the legal challenge by the NRA in March, two years after a three-judge panel similarly ruled against the organization. The Florida Legislature passed and then-Gov. Rick Scott signed the law shortly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 people.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said after that ruling that his office would not defend the law if in fact the NRA filed an appeal with the high court.
“Notwithstanding CA11’s opinion today, I believe restricting the right of law-abiding adults to purchase firearms is unconstitutional,” Uthmeier said on X on March 14, adding that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reached the same conclusion. “Men and women old enough to fight and die for our country should be able to purchase firearms to defend themselves and their families.”
The NRA’s petition for certiorari calls upon the justices to review the split among federal circuit courts over whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits have ruled that they do, while the Tenth and Eleventh circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
The Florida House in March passed a bill (HB 759) that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third straight year the chamber has done so, but both times the legislation failed to be come law because the proposal never moved in the Florida Senate.

Most of the clients had gone to work.Rows of double bunk beds packed two tight rooms with yellow walls and low ceilings at 187 Church St. One room provides 28 beds for single male adults and the other has eight beds available for female adults, and there are a couple of bathrooms with showers. Each of the beds has a number that corresponds to a locker in the hallway. There is a common area downstairs with some chairs, tables, two washer-dryers, a TV and a makeshift kitchen.Makeshift is how the shelter has operated for four decades, while homelessness and the need for safe, temporary housing has only grown.In the last federal fiscal year (October 2023 – September 2024), the Waystation, as the night shelter is called, served 159 unique individuals. Jonathan Farrell, executive director of the nonprofit that provides a wide array of housing and shelter services and advocates for long-term solutions to end homelessness, said 30 of those individuals were chronically homeless.“We are seeing unprecedented numbers of folks who are unhoused and sleeping rough in our communities,” he said.With 2,500 square feet over two floors, the night shelter has long outgrown the space in a city and state that has continued to see more and more people experiencing homelessness.Jonathan Farrell, the executive director of the Committee on Temporary Shelter, at the COTS Waystation shelter in Burlington on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont’s rate of homelessness ranks fourth in the nation and increased by nearly 5% between early 2023 and early 2024, according to the most recent annual point-in-time count, a federally-mandated tally of unhoused people taken on one night in January. Over the last few years, state leaders have restricted Vermont’s motel voucher program, limiting the back-up shelter option as homelessness has grown. Meanwhile, a bill that could overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is making its way through the Legislature.In Chittenden County alone, there are “a solid 250 to 300” who are unhoused, Farrell estimated.While the Waystation has been a lifeline for many seeking shelter at night, the aging facility does not meet current needs and has been on COTS’ agenda for improvement. In January, the organization acquired 58 Pearl St. — the former social security building -– and  work has begun to create a more modern, spacious, ADA-compliant night shelter there, Farrell said.The 7,361 square foot property will triple the space available in the current Waystation and provide beds for up to 56 adults, allowing COTS to expand its shelter services by 55%, according to a recent press release.“We are really focused on the dignity of the space,” Farrell said.To do so, COTS needs money.Renovating the building, in partnership with Duncan Wisniewski Architecture and JA Morrissey Construction, is estimated to cost $2 million, the release states. COTS’ capital campaign for a new Waystation has raised $500,000 from the State of Vermont Office of Economic Opportunity and $600,000 from anonymous donors. The Hoehl Family Foundation has provided a $200,000 challenge grant and COTS is looking to raise another $200,000 in matching funds to open the new space.The Hoefl grant has donated the first $100,000 and plans to match it with a second $100,000 once the additional $200,000 has been raised, according to the release.“It’s not charity, it’s solidarity,” said Katharine Kostin, a Hoehl Family Foundation board member, in the release. “We believe we’re only as strong as our most vulnerable neighbors; therefore, we’re privileged to work with the community toward supporting the dignity of every person.”Besides providing critically needed beds and space, the new center will provide a better kitchen, more laundry options, six private bathrooms with showers, a break room, common areas, an office and intake space for community partners and service providers.“It could be a health care provider, a street outreach person, could be an EMT or a nurse to see one of our guests in a private setting for medical, mental health, really anything. So we’re really excited about that and partnering with other folks in the community to provide those services to our guests,” Farrell said.In addition to providing a safe, supportive environment, Farrell said the new Waystation will have a positive impact on downtown by providing 20 more beds. So “contributing to the Waystation campaign is a direct, tangible way for people in our community who want to be part of the solution to do so,” he said.“Our downtown is facing a crisis,” states a May 9 letter signed by more than 100 area businesses and sent to Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak. The letter cites “street harassment, visible drug use, and threatening behavior” among the reasons they say have contributed to less foot traffic and staff retention leading to recent closures. Businesses are increasingly having to work on managing overdoses, mental health issues, shoplifting and cleaning up downtown, the letter states, urging the city to do better with communication, security, cleanliness and restorative efforts.The former Wilson Hotel in Burlington houses the Committee on Temporary Shelter ’s (COTS) Waystation shelter and transitional housing.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerLooking forwardThe Church Street space that shares walls with the Wilson apartments will be converted to create more permanent housing available for COTS’ clients to transition into, he said. The red brick building it abuts houses 23 deeply affordable permanent housing rooms for low-income and formerly unhoused individuals. Many of the tenants have been there for more than two decades, although the average turnaround is about 7 years, according to Farrell.Originally home of the Mills brothers who published Burlington’s first newspaper — The Northern Sentinel -– and dominated the printing and publishing market in the first half of the 19th century, the building later housed a hotel. A faded blue sign -– The Wilson — still hangs off the corner of the red brick building, built around 1820. Inside, there are elaborate textured tin ceilings and exposed copper piping harkening to a bygone era.Open 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., the Waystation is much older than the organization that was started by volunteers in 1982. COTS acquired it to use as a shelter soon after with two early board members putting their own homes up as collateral, according to Farrell.On Thursday morning, some of the blankets on the double bunk beds in a cramped room were rumpled; some were neatly folded and set on pillows. And some of the grey-blue lockers in the hallway sported stickers: ‘I (red heart) Jesus’ and ‘Owl forest.’Most of their temporary owners will return to lay their heads down. Unlike the stereotypes that persist, more than 70% of them have day jobs, Farrell said. And many of them, he said, are looking forward to the new, improved Pearl Street Waystation, which is expected to open in December.Read the story on VTDigger here:  COTS seeks public help to fund new, expanded overnight adult shelter in Burlington.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/COTS-waystation-3-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

A recent move by Doña Ana County to sever ties with a troubled Southern NM utility prompted Kenney to applaud the statement and urge further changes to the utility. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s top environmental official made the rare move this week of wielding political capital instead of regulatory power, saying he has little confidence in a troubled water provider in the southern part of the state that has been dogged by ongoing violations in arsenic levels.
Environment Secretary James Kenney urged the city of Sunland Park to follow the lead of surrounding Doña Ana County and sever ties with the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority. An independent, third party should oversee the utility in the meantime, Kenney said.
“We’re weighing in at this point because we’ve had it,” Kenney told Source NM, and acknowledged that it is unusual for the state to speak on a water supplier’s governance. “While we’re exhausting our enforcement, our legal approaches, we have another approach: We have to speak about it.”
He encouraged the restructuring of the utility at the local level, saying the state has limited tools to address the chronic issues at CRRUA.
“We can continue to assess civil penalties, collect those civil penalties, take them to court, but it is difficult to sort of seek an injunction and say, ‘You’re no longer allowed to operate,’ because that means the community is without water for any purpose, including things like fire suppression,” Kenney said.
CRRUA serves approximately 19,000 people in the border city of Sunland Park, Santa Theresa and the southernmost portion of Doña Ana County, an area with naturally occurring high levels of arsenic in the groundwater. Sunland Park and Doña Ana County jointly operate the utility, which is governed by a seven-member board.
The area has long struggled with arsenic – which over the long term can cause cancer and skin lesions – in drinking water, with health reports and concerns over treatment plants ongoing for nearly a decade.
State investigators intervened following a series of water quality issues in November 2023.The New Mexico Environment Department found that CRRUA sent drinking water with arsenic to residents’ homes while its three arsenic treatment systems were “offline and bypassed” for more than a year, in addition to dozens of significant treatment, training and facility issues.
State officials say Doña Ana Co. water had ‘systemic failures by management’

CRRUA is facing an ongoing lawsuit for alleged civil rights violations in state district court, and is also scheduled for a June 17 public hearing in Santa Fe regarding its protest of NMED’s $251,580 fines.
In media releases and prior statements to Source NM, CRRUA officials said they have worked to reduce arsenic levels and continue repeating that water is safe to drink. Specifically, CRRUA reported on May 5 that it has addressed 98% of the issues raised in the December 2023 report.
CRRUA said recent tests showing arsenic levels above the limit at one treatment plant were found as part of its voluntary testing.
“These follow-up tests are for internal monitoring and public transparency only. They are not for compliance purposes,” CRRUA Executive director Juan Crosby said in a press release Thursday. “Only the quarterly tests NMED conducts are for compliance and according to the latest compliance tests, the Santa Teresa Industrial ATF remains NMED compliant.”
Kenney said CRRUA can simultaneously be improving on the past violations, improving training and monitoring but also failing to restore the water quality.
“But at the end of the day, the only metric that matters is the quality of the water and the safety of that water getting into people’s houses,” Kenney said.
Past and recent arsenic level violations
No known safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic exists, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a health-based limit on drinking water at 10 parts per billion.
On April 29, CRRUA reported an arsenic level of 12 parts per billion at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant. One week later, in a separate test shared with NMED, the same plant reported another violation of 12 parts per billion on May 6.
Kenney endorsed recommendations from community organizations asking for a health assessment and to supply arsenic testing strips or potentially additional sources of water.
In a May 7 press release, CRRUA said it would not provide test strips because it would violate the state’s anti-donation clause and that test strips contain “hazardous materials that require proper handling.”
Kenney said that “demonstrated an inability to understand the magnitude of the problem.”
“I don’t know why the concern about a one-time exposure to a test strip that may contain mercury is CRRUA’s greater concern than the arsenic in the water that’s hitting people’s homes,” Kenney said.
Daisy Maldonado, who has organized in the community at the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County, told Source NM she was surprised, but welcomed NMED’s endorsement of the recent demands the group issued to CRRUA.
“I would put it back on Secretary Kenney and if CRRUA says they cannot provide those types of services, then we’re going to look obviously to NMED to be a partner in providing funding for test strips, third-party water and that health assessment,” Maldonando said.
She said the opportunity to reshape CRRUA over the next four years will offer an opportunity for Empowerment Congress to build a utility that’s more responsive to residents.
“A new structure should be established that really serves, again, the community,” Maldonado said. “That the highest priority is safe, clean drinking water water that people can trust.”
CRRUA next steps likely to take years
Earlier this week, Doña Ana County took the first step in a yearslong process to separate itself from CRRUA’s current governance.
At the May 13 meeting, after an hour-and-a-half closed session, the Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners unanimously voted to send immediate notice to Sunland Park to start the termination process of the Joint Powers Agreement, a formal charter allowing multiple public bodies to work together. The agreement, renewed last year, requires either one of the parties to give four years notice.
Blame spirals as CRRUA governing record ‘misplaced’ and never sent to state

On Friday, Doña Ana County Commission Chair Christopher Schaljo-Hernandez told Source NM that the vote is a first step to force negotiations and correct customer dissatisfaction. He said the current agreement overrepresents Sunland Park on the board, and that termination is the only way to renegotiate the makeup of CRRUA’s governing board.
Schaljo-Hernandez emphasized that CRRUA will continue operating in the meantime, and that negotiations will begin very soon.
“We’re going to work towards making sure that every single person serviced by CRRUA has their water quality improved,” Schaljo-Hernandez said. “The county has the vision that we’re going to improve this for all users. We’re not saying to Sunland Park ‘we’re taking ours and you’re taking yours, good luck.’”
Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea told Source NM in a phone call that it’s too early to determine what the city will do, but did not commit to cutting ties with CRRUA.
“I don’t know what it will look like today or tomorrow,” Perea said. “No plans have been developed yet, this is still very early on in the process.”
When asked about recent arsenic level violations, Perea said he believes the utility is making progress.
“The steps that we’re taking are working and being able to detect these issues and we’re trying to correct it as soon as possible, rather than having to wait for the required state testing,” he said. “The utility has made its stride over the last year, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”
Further, Perea said more funding is needed for a successful water utility, not just form rate-payers, but from the state and federal government.
“This was done on the back of infrastructure in Sunland Park, and we haven’t received our fair share of funding in this part of the state,” he said. “I hope that in this process, the state can also have funding opportunities for us to tap into and address these issues that have existed or been deferred for a long time.”
The New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration secretary is required to approve all joint powers agreements, including any modifications.
In a statement Henry Valdez, the director of legislative affairs at DFA, said the secretary’s approval is “limited to reviewing for compliance to ensure the terms and conditions are applicable,” and that any amendments or modifications to an agreement would require the secretary’s approval.

Free.,"Trump move to deport Venezuelans violated due process, U.S. Supreme Court rules",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-move-deport-venezuelans-violated-due-process-us-supreme-court-rules,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday kept in place a block on the Trump administration's efforts to deport 176 Venezuelans in Northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.A majority of the justices found that President Donald Trump’s administration violated the due process rights of Venezuelans when the administration tried to deport them from North Texas last month by invoking the 18th-century wartime law. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.“Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” according to the decision.The justices did not determine the legality of the Trump administration using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans 14 and older with suspected ties to the gang Tren de Aragua.On his social media platform, Trump expressed his disapproval of the ruling.“THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” he wrote on Truth Social.The justices found that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals “erred in dismissing the detainees’ appeal for lack of jurisdiction,” and vacated that order, sending the case back.The Trump administration on Monday asked the high court to remove the injunction, arguing that detaining suspected members of Tren de Aragua poses a threat to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and staff.In a Wednesday response, the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit, warned that if the Supreme Court lifts its injunction, “most of the putative class members will be removed with little chance to seek judicial review.”In Friday’s order, the justices noted that because the Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act to send migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador, careful due process is needed.“The Government has represented elsewhere that it is unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador…where it is alleged that detainees face indefinite detention,” according to the order, noting the wrongful deportation of Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.“The detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty,” the court continued.Other rulingsOn April 18, the ACLU made an emergency application to the high court, asking to bar any removals under the Alien Enemies Act in the Northern District of Texas over concerns that the Trump administration was not following due process.Several federal judges elsewhere have blocked the use of the wartime law in their districts that cover Colorado, Southern Texas and Southern New York.A federal judge in Western Pennsylvania Tuesday was the first to uphold the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, but said those accused must have at least three weeks to challenge their removal.",,,,2025-05-16 18:06:38.105821

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As an anticipated reduction to the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments by the Trump administration looms, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren is calling for the monuments to be kept at their current sizes in the name of efficiency.
“In light of the current administration’s stated priorities on efficiency and reducing waste, we believe that maintaining the integrity of established monument boundaries supports those goals,” Nygren wrote in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, according to a post by the Navajo leader on X. “Changing the boundaries and reopening finalized planning processes would not only risk the loss of valuable progress but may also lead to inefficiencies, duplicative expenditures, and delays in implementing conservation strategies.”
The letter asks that no changes to the monuments’ sizes be made without a meaningful dialogue with “all tribal nations with ancestral ties to these lands.”

In his confirmation hearing, Burgum hinted at support for reducing the monuments and echoed Utah leaders’ criticism of use of the Antiquities Act to put protections on large areas of land.
Bears Ears has deep spiritual and cultural importance to a number of Indigenous peoples, including the Diné, or Navajo, Nygren said in his post, noting that like neighboring Grand Staircase it is a “revered landscape.”
The monuments in southeastern Utah have been a political football for multiple presidential administrations, starting with the establishment of Grand Staircase in 1996 by President Bill Clinton who used his power under the Antiquities Act, a law passed in 1906 that gives the president authority to declare national monuments to protect areas of cultural, historical and scientific significance.
President Barack Obama then used the Antiquities Act at the end of his term in 2016 to give monument status to Bears Ears, an area tribes had long lobbied to protect.
Both monuments were scaled back by President Donald Trump when he took office in 2017, cutting Bears Ears from 1.36 million acres to 1 million acres, and Grand Staircase-Escalante from 1.35 million acres to 229,000 acres.
In 2021, President Joe Biden restored the monuments to their original sizes, a decision Utah is challenging in court.
Meanwhile, polling indicates that 71% of voters favor maintaining Bears Ears as a national monument, while 74% support keeping Grand Staircase-Escalante as a national monument.

(Photo by Jim Peaco/Yellowstone National Park)Yellowstone National Park wildlife staff trapped and euthanized a grizzly bear this week after a series of conflicts with human food sources and trash in the park’s most popular tourist areas.
According to a Wednesday press release from the park, the 11-year-old, male grizzly bear, estimated to weigh 400 pounds, had repeatedly sought out food sources near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot.
The griz developed a strategy to flip over 800-pound dumpsters, uprooted small bear-resistant trash cans from their concrete bases and “became increasingly food-conditioned,” which wildlife managers decided posed a safety risk in such a busy area fo the park. The decisions to euthanize the animal was made to ensure public safety and reduce the chances of other bears becoming habituated to human food.
“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther said in a press release. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”

The last grizzly bear killed in a management action in Yellowstone was in the fall of 2017, when park officials removed a griz that was damaging tents and accessing human food in backcountry campsites near Heart lake.
Yellowstone National Park’s bear management plan provides bear-resistant food storage lockers in all campgrounds, food storage devices in all backcountry campsites, and bear-resistant garbage cans and lockers. Park officials remind all visitors that utilizing these bear safety measures remain crucial in ensuring public safety, and preventing wildlife from developing dangerous habits.
All of Yellowstone is bear country, from the trails in the park’s backcountry to the boardwalks and parking lots around Old Faithful. Visitor safety cannot be guaranteed, but visitors can play an active role in protecting themselves and the bears people come here to enjoy.
Park staff ask that anyone involved in a conflict with a bear, regardless of how minor, contact park officials or report it to a park ranger as soon as possible. If cell service is available, dial 911. The lives of other people, and the bear, may depend on it.

Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing records indicate that so far this year, at least 33 nursing homes have been cited for resident abuse or failing to properly screen job applicants for histories of criminal activity or abuse. In most of those cases, the homes were subjected to a state fine of $500.

Among the violators:
Grundy Care Center, Grundy: In January, the home was cited for failing to protect residents from mental and physical abuse. Inspectors reported that a nurse aide at the home had accepted money from a male resident, and had kissed, touched, and sent nude photos of herself via text to the man. The inappropriate interactions continued until the nurse aide resigned, inspectors determined. The resident told inspectors the aide had wanted him to move in with her so she could take care of him.
The administrator of the home later learned the relationship was sexual, with conduct occurring during and after the aide’s scheduled working hours. The nurse aide reportedly admitted that after she met the resident, the two exchanged phone numbers and she followed him on social media and would message him via text and Facebook Messenger. She allegedly said it evolved into a relationship and that “neither did something the other didn’t want.” She reportedly acknowledged the inappropriate physical touching happened during her working hours, but added, “It was just kissing, that’s all.”
The matter was referred to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services by the police. According to state inspectors, DHHS “rejected the report and closed the case.”
Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation, Des Moines: In January, a male resident’s son alerted the home to misappropriation of property. The resident’s son had installed a camera in his father’s room, which captured footage of a certified nurse aide entering the room at 2 a.m. while the resident slept and accessing a locked drawer containing the resident’s money. Later, it appeared $55 was missing from the drawer. The administrator confirmed for state inspectors that he watched the video and it was evident the worker unlocked the dresser with a key, picked up something and put it in her pocket.
Harmony Waterloo, formerly Promedica Skilled Nursing & Rehab, Waterloo: Earlier this month, this home was cited for failing to protect residents from abuse in the form of financial exploitation. Residents of the home reported they routinely gave the staff money, credit cards or debit cards to purchase pop for them from vending machines. After one resident was discharged, she received a phone call from her bank regarding a debit card payment for a $417 cellphone bill, which depleted her account. It was later determined the phone in question belonged to a nurse aide who worked at the facility. A check of that aide’s criminal history revealed a past charge of third-degree theft that had resulted in a deferred judgment.

– Registered nurse at Lakeside Lutheran Home in Emmetsburg, according to inspectors


Lakeside Lutheran Home, Emmetsburg: In February, this facility was cited for failing to protect residents from abuse. Workers alleged that a registered nurse had tried to check a male resident’s blood sugar and after the man attempted to bite the nurse, she told him, “If you bite me, I will knock all the teeth out of your mouth,” and then raised her hand as if to strike him. An aide reported that she verbally intervened and said, “Hey,” and nurse lowered her hand.
Silver Oak Nursing & Rehab Center, Marion: In March, the home was cited for failing to report the exploitation of a resident and the potential misappropriation of the resident’s medication. According to inspectors, one registered nurse at the home was responsible for administering the resident’s medication commonly used for erectile dysfunction, and 21 to 33 tablets were unaccounted for. The resident indicated he had tipped the nurse $5 or $10 for her birthday and that on occasion, he had kissed the nurse and believed he was in love with her.
Staff members had reported seeing the two hugging and kissing. A medication aide reported seeing the two together and seeing the nurse stick her tongue “down his throat,” and also indicated the nurse may have given the resident money for a phone. A county deputy later told an inspector that a backpack owned by the nurse contained a prescription-drug label for an erectile dysfunction drug that indicated it was prescribed to the resident in question. Inspectors concluded the home made no effort to separate the nurse from the resident while the medication issue and exploitation issue were investigated.
Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center’s Klein Center, West Burlington: In April, this facility was cited for failing to report allegations of abuse. A nurse aide at the home had reported to administrators that another worker at the home had confronted a resident who had expressed concern for a fellow resident’s welfare, telling him not to worry about others and to “sit your f—ing a– down.”
The accused worker was also reported by another worker to have called a resident a “b—-” on many occasions. In one alleged incident, a resident was being showered by the accused worker and complained the water was too hot, to which the worker replied, “Shut the f— up.”
Tripoli Nursing & Rehab Center, Tripoli: In April, the home was cited for three staff members being verbally abusive or physically rough with residents. One resident told inspectors, “I don’t like the way (other residents) are being talked to. (The workers) have no compassion. They talk to them very demanding… It is not ethical. We are family here.” Another resident said one of the workers was upset with a colleague and so “she just kind of threw me in bed or pushed me in bed.” The resident said the staffer was rough with him but that he didn’t consider it abuse.
Rehabilitation Centers of Independence, West Campus, Independence: In April, this facility was cited for failing to report abuse. A former resident of the facility had reported that that he had transferred $22 to one of the home’s nurse aides via PayPal at the end of February, and had only been paid back $10.

House Bill 3532 aims to speed the process of removing offensive titles from remaining sites. (Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)Oregon lawmakers aim to speed up the process for renaming dozens of creeks, lakes, mountains and other sites that still hold offensive names.
The Oregon Senate will soon take up House Bill 3532, which would have the Oregon Geographic Names Board — a group advised by the Oregon Historical Society — make a list of places with offensive geographic names within three years of the bill’s passage and determine new names in consultation with local governments and tribes.
Currently, anyone can send a suggestion to the board to rename a location. But it’s a lengthy process, Oregon Historical Society Kerry Tymchuk told the Oregon Capital Chronicle. After receiving a renaming suggestion, the board must tour the area, study its history and connect with tribes, local elected officials and landowners for their feedback, he said. Name changes ultimately require federal approval, too.
The Oregon Historical Society has already identified 107 locations across Oregon with offensive names that remain unchanged. Many of them include derogatory terms used to demean Black individuals, immigrants and Native American women — such as Squaw Creek in Douglas County, Chinaman Hat in Josephine County and Cannibal Mountain in Lincoln County.
The Oregon House already advanced the bill in a 45-3 vote. The Senate may approve the bill in the coming days or weeks before reaching the governor’s desk.
 As Trump admin prioritizes ‘American Greatness,’ Oregon bill honors Indigenous history

Oregon is no outlier for having locations with derogatory names. In recent years, lawmakers in Texas, Maine and California have also tried passing legislation to rename places with offensive titles.
These state-level efforts gained momentum after the Biden administration in 2021 created a commission to remove offensive names from federal lands and declared the word “squaw” derogatory. It replaced 650 locations with that term with names honoring Native American history and culture.
But under the Trump administration, some U.S. lawmakers have doubts as to whether the federal government would approve name changes. In February, a Democratic Maine lawmaker withdrew a bill similar to Oregon’s, citing conflicting federal and local views, the Maine Morning Star reported.
The Maine lawmaker’s decision was based on President Donald Trump’s first day in office, when he issued an executive order overriding the U.S. Board of Geographic Names’ authority and called to rename the Gulf of Mexico to “Gulf of America” and revert the name of North America’s tallest peak, Denali, to Mount McKinley.
Denali means “the great one” in the Koyukon language, an Alaskan Native group that lives north of the peak. The federal government’s official name for it until 2015 was Mount McKinley — named after the country’s 25th President William McKinley who was from Ohio and had never visited or had ties to Alaska.
Oregon has taken steps to rename some of its geographic features with offensive titles. Most recently, the Oregon Geographic Names Board in September successfully led an effort to replace the names of two creeks that had racist terms used against Black individuals, the Oregonian reported.
Oregon’s House Bill 3532 builds on 2001 legislation led by then-Sen. Kate Brown to remove the word “squaw” from location names. Despite that legislation, the term is still used for dozens of Oregon locations. Brown, Oregon’s governor from 2015 to 2023, testified in support of the bill, saying the state has a lot more work to do to remove offensive, racist and derogatory names.
 Bill championed by Indigenous Oregon lawmakers

Indigenous women, like Rep. Tawna Sanchez, a Portland Democrat of Shoshone-Bannock, Ute, and Carrizo descent and the bill’s lead sponsor, said derogatory terms shouldn’t still exist on Oregon’s map.
“Renaming offensive locations in Oregon reflects our shared commitment to mutual respect, historical truth and creating a welcoming environment for all Oregonians,” Sanchez said. “My hope is that no one has to drive in any wonderful part of the state of Oregon and feel like they don’t belong there.”
Sanchez told the Capital Chronicle that the federal government would still have to approve the renaming of places with offensive titles.
The bill includes an amendment to uplift local control, she said, but for a name change to be approved, it would have to go through the Oregon Geographic Names Board. Then, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names makes the final call.
“Our hope is the federal government will act on the recommendation from the (Oregon board) that was made through a comprehensive process that reflects the will of Oregonians. Any result other than that would be pure politics,” Sanchez said.
The three Republicans who voted against the bill— Reps. Jami Cate of Lebanon, Virgle Osborne of Roseburg and Alek Skarlatos of Winston — did not explain their votes in the House and did not respond to Capital Chronicle.
Rep. Annessa Hartman, D-Gladstone, a cosponsor and member of the Snipe Clan of the Cayuga Nation, part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, told her House colleagues that from a young age she’s known about the derogatory terms used against her and her community.
“It was up to us to just ignore them and just ignore the pain and the suffering that those words had caused to my people and our family,” she said on the House floor. “To see those still plastered across maps, rivers and street signs and now having my own children — I don’t want to continue that legacy of having them to just accept that that term is being used.”

(Photo obtained from Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality files)Russellville-based Denali announced Friday that it will stop depositing waste from chicken processing facilities in its Van Buren lagoon by the end of 2025.
The announcement came after dozens of Fort Smith-area residents spoke at a public hearing held by the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality Thursday evening. Both residents and elected officials described how odors from the lagoon, and from Denali’s land application operations, had negatively affected their lives and businesses, and the region as a whole.
“Denali will discontinue bringing material to the storage facility this year,” Denali CEO Todd Mathes said in an emailed press release.
“Disposition of the material at the site will be determined after Dec. 31, 2025. Denali is currently executing its long-term plan for alternative storage capacity and long-term infrastructure solutions throughout the region, which will allow for the closure of the open-air facility in Crawford County,” Mathes said. “Working with regulatory officials to obtain permits and permit modifications are required in order to completely close the storage facility in a timely manner.”
Denali told the Advocate earlier this month that “we have not committed to an exact date,” citing the need to obtain additional storage and permits.
Denali said it would provide notifications to local officials before the lagoon is cleaned out. A previous clean-out of millions of gallons of sludge from the lagoon in 2024 led to dozens of complaints about odor to DEQ from Fort Smith residents.
However, the waste recycling company emphasized that Sebastian and Crawford counties remained “important operational areas” for Denali due to the number of food processors in the region. 
The press release did not address concerns of some critics about the volume of waste being applied to fields in the area nor how land applications were affecting residents living nearby.
Crawford County has one of the highest number of land application permits in the state, with at least eight. Most of the Crawford County permits are held by Denali. HydroAg Environmental is another permit holder.

SPRINGFIELD — On May 19, 1875, a Cook County jury handed down a verdict in a case concerning the health and welfare of Mary Lincoln, widow of the former president who had been assassinated a decade earlier.

After listening to only a single day of testimony, the 12 men on the jury signed the standard verdict form stating simply that they “are satisfied that said Mary Lincoln is insane, and is a fit person to be sent to a State Hospital for the Insane …”

The case had been brought to court by her surviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln, then just 31 years old and a successful practicing attorney in Chicago. At his request, the court ordered her committed to the Bellevue Place Sanitarium in Batavia, west of Chicago, and named him conservator of her estate for a period of one year, based on the finding that she was at the time incapable of managing her own affairs.

But Mrs. Lincoln would not spend a full year in the facility. With the help of two of her closest and only remaining friends, James and Myra Bradwell, of Chicago – and against the strong protests of Robert Lincoln – Mary Lincoln would be released after only four months to the custody of her sister in Springfield, Elizabeth Edwards.

The subject of Mary Lincoln’s mental health has long been the subject of public debate. Was she, in fact, a danger to herself and others, and was her son truly acting in her best interests? Or was Robert Lincoln, as his mother would sometimes allege, scheming to shove her aside in order to take over her money and property?

Now, 150 years after her commitment, a newly rediscovered collection of correspondence between Mrs. Lincoln and her friends and family – letters long assumed to have been lost or destroyed – shed new light on the nature of her illness as well as the nature of her relationships with the few friends and family she had left by that time.

[caption id=""attachment_67091"" align=""alignleft"" width=""289""] “The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow, As Revealed by Her Own Letters,” edited by Jason Emerson and published by Southern Illinois University Press.[/caption]

“The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow, As Revealed by Her Own Letters,” was compiled by historian Jason Emerson and was recently released by Southern Illinois University Press.

“People have always wondered if these missing letters, if they showed that, in fact, she was perfectly sane, that her son Robert did actually railroad her, bribe the judge and jury because he wanted to steal her money,” Emerson said in a podcast interview with Capitol News Illinois. “And they do not show that at all. They show that Mary thought that's what was happening – which, in my opinion, and the opinions of psychiatrists I've consulted – that was one of her delusions, that everyone was trying to steal her money, not just Robert.”

The book was actually first compiled a century ago by Myra Helmer Pritchard, granddaughter of James and Myra Bradwell, and they were scheduled for publication in 1927, first in installments in the magazine “Liberty,” and then as a book.

Before the publication, however, Pritchard, as a courtesy, offered to show them to Mary Harlan Lincoln, widow of Robert Lincoln, who had just died the year before. Although she was initially agreeable to the project and even offered to add additional information, after reading the manuscript, Mary Harlan Lincoln withdrew her consent and launched a series of legal efforts to suppress their publication.

Pritchard eventually agreed to hand over the material and never publish them in any form, in exchange for a payment of $22,500.

Emerson’s book recompiles that material and presents it as it was intended to be published in 1927, including Pritchard’s comments on the letters. But it also includes Emerson’s own annotations and footnotes that provide context, as well as clarifications and corrections to some of Pritchard’s commentaries.

The letters reveal her to be lonely, occasionally depressed and at times desperate for companionship. But on their surface, do not necessarily portray someone of an unsound mind, especially considering the traumas she had endured through much of her life.

“Pray for me that I may be able to leave such a place as this,” she wrote to Myra Bradwell on Aug. 3, 1875. “Let me see Judge Bradwell. I beg you to come on Friday morning. I should like to see Dr. Evarts. I feel I must have some further conversation with him. Write me, your heartbroken friend, frequently, daily. But come to me. Will you kindly bring out some samples of black alpaca a best quality without luster and without cotton. Also some samples of heavier black woolen goods.”

The book is Emerson’s second work on the subject of the lost letters, which he uncovered in 2005. He found them locked away in a trunk that had once belonged to one of Robert Lincoln’s personal attorneys, Frederick Towers.

Using those letters and a wealth of other material, Emerson wrote his first book on the subject, “The Madness of Mary Lincoln,” in 2007.

In that book, Emerson cites a modern psychiatric expert who theorized that Mary Lincoln suffered from what would likely be diagnosed today as bipolar disorder.

“And he told me that today, Mary would be committed involuntarily for probably about seven days,” he said. “Doctors would look at her. They'd give her medication, and she'd be fine today, as long as she took the medication.”

“But back then, they didn't have that,” Emerson said. “But if you look at her whole life, it's very clear the incidence of bipolar disorder, or what used to be called manic depressive illness, where she's high and she's low, and she's wonderfully loving and horribly mean. Her spending could be considered a manic action. She was depressed a lot. So it's clear throughout her whole life.”

After her release, Mary Todd Lincoln lived a relatively quiet life, although she remained plagued by both psychiatric and physical ailments. She died in 1882 at the age of 63. She is buried next to her husband at the Lincoln Tomb in Springfield, along with three of their sons: Edward, William and Thomas.

Robert Lincoln went on to lead a distinguished career of his own. In addition to his legal career, he served as secretary of war under President James Garfield and continued in that post under President Chester A. Arthur after Garfield’s assassination. He also served as minister to Great Britain in the Benjamin Harrison administration. He died in 1926 at age 82.

The report, released Thursday following an independent seven-month investigation, also asserts that Connecticut State Police committed an “unexplained failure” by taking 15 months to seek arrest warrants for Anthony Mastrangelo, a town employee who allegedly sexually assaulted four girls, despite having probable cause to do so. During that 15-month period, a fifth victim was allegedly sexually assaulted. 
The report, prepared by former Superior Court Judge Robert L. Holzberg, now with the Pullman & Comley law firm, comes as Connecticut legislators are in the midst of debating a controversial bill that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state. Currently, camps in Connecticut that are run by towns and cities receive no state oversight and aren’t required to comply with even basic regulations that private camps must abide by, like conducting staff background checks and testing water quality. 
“If this [report] isn’t a manifesto for the need to pass Senate Bill 6 this session, I don’t know what is,” Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, whose district includes Bethany, told The Connecticut Mirror. “We may never have a better reason, detailed for us in black and white. I want to use the word ‘shocking’ to describe what was uncovered in Bethany, but it goes beyond that. The callousness. The disregard. Utter incompetence. Basic, basic safety rules not adhered to. They can’t find reports and training manuals. And I love my cities and towns, but I wonder — what if we scratched a little deeper into more municipal programs? What would we find? Would we find excellence? Competence? Or more problems?”
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition when a similar bill was proposed in 2023. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
But, according to the report, Bethany’s Parks and Recreation Department was in disarray at the time Cofrancesco provided written testimony against the bill, and she didn’t know if counselors there received background checks or safety training at all. According to the report, the department “had no filing or record-keeping system, written safety policies, or documented training protocols for its staff.” According to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024.
Cofrancesco did not respond to a request for comment. When asked for comment by reporters after the report came out on Thursday, she responded, “Not right now, thank you.”
State Police Col. Daniel Loughman said in a statement that he agreed with the report’s claim that Cofrancesco did not demand answers about the investigation before May 2024, and that Cofrancesco never sought a meeting with the state police after May 2024.
But the statement did not address the report’s concerns about the 15-month span between the beginning of the investigation and Mastrangelo’s arrest.
Gina Teixiera, a member of the Bethany Board of Selectmen, told the CT Mirror that  Cofrancesco should resign.
“I feel that it’s a fiduciary duty, given the liability she’s created for this town,” she said.
In a statement, Teixiera and Robert Brinton, the other member of the board of selectmen, said Cofrancesco’s behavior was “inexcusable.”
“The report reveals a First Selectwoman more concerned about her own self-interest and that of her family and friends, including the alleged child sex-abuser, than the safety of the children in our community,” the statement reads. “This is inexcusable. Her repeated deception of not only the members of the Board of Selectmen, but also all of the residents of the Town of Bethany, at meeting after meeting, is a betrayal from a person in a position of trust.”
Cofrancesco’s “leadership failures have harmed the Town of Bethany and exposed us to legal liability on multiple fronts,” it continues. “Town residents deserve answers about why municipal laptops and phones were deleted in violation of Connecticut Freedom of Information statutes. 
“Also, the residents of the Town of Bethany need answers about the unexplained, lengthy delay by the Connecticut State Police to make any arrest even after having sufficient probable cause in a case involving child sex abuse. This delay was supported by Paula Cofrancesco, who failed to communicate with the Connecticut State Police in any way, to request any information about the matter even after falsely saying she had tried to get answers from them many times,” the statement reads.
‘That claim is contradicted’
The report begins its timeline in December of 2022, when Bethany superintendent Kai Byrd learned that a parent would be filing a report with the Department of Children and Families (DCF) against Mastrangelo, a camp counselor, substitute teacher, after school program employee and frequent babysitter for local children. 
According to the report, Cofrancesco was informed by David Merriam, the administrative lieutenant for the Bethany Resident Trooper’s Office, of the nature of the allegations against Mastrangelo and that the Connecticut State Police were also investigating the matter. But after the allegations became public in 2024, Cofrancesco repeatedly insisted that she did not know the sexual nature of the allegations until much later. 
The report alleges that she was lying. 
“Corroborating e-mails and text messages [demonstrate] that the First Selectman, despite her denials, knew the specific nature of the allegations against Mastrangelo as early as December 23, 2022,” the report states.
“While the First Selectman still denies having actual knowledge … of the specific allegations against Mastrangelo, that claim is contradicted by multiple credible witnesses,” the report states.

The report indicates that, rather than alert the town about the allegations or fire Mastrangelo, Cofrancesco’s response was to keep quiet and ensure that Mastrangelo — a family friend — remained employed in the basement of Town Hall, adjacent to the Parks and Recreation complex, and later at her husband’s insurance firm. 
“Curiously, she acknowledged that she never attempted to speak to Mastrangelo about the allegations or reach out to DCF, the State Police, or Town Counsel about the allegations,” the report states.  
Cofrancesco also did not pursue any improvements of safety procedures in those programs after the allegations came to light and even denied requests from other staff members to install security cameras, according to the report. 
Even when Cofrancesco became aware that DCF had confirmed at least two allegations against Mastrangelo, she failed to “implement background checks of all Parks and Rec employees; direct an immediate and comprehensive review of Parks and Rec Programs and policies,” pursue safety measures for children, or even seek the advice of the town attorney, according to the report.

The report, which goes on for 28 pages and includes another 200 pages of appendices, was a massive undertaking for Holzberg, a retired judge of 32 years who has a reputation both as a skilled mediator and investigator. Holzberg also conducted independent investigations into sexual assault allegations at Stamford High School and the Bridgeport Archdiocese, where he identified 281 victims of sexual abuse by 71 priests dating back to 1953. 
For the Bethany report, Holzberg and his team of three lawyers spent seven months on the investigation and interviewed 48 witnesses and reviewed more than 125,000 emails and phone records. 
At one point, the former judge quoted a witness comparing Bethany to “Mayberry,” the fictional town in the 1960s-era Andy Griffith Show, where town employees are all related to each other. For example, the report said Cofrancesco is the cousin by marriage of the former Director of Parks and Recreation, Janice Howard; She is also the aunt by marriage of a Parks and Recreation Department employee, Anthony Cofrancesco, who was friends with Mastrangelo.
The report details concerns among other town staff about Mastrangelo’s continued employment and presence in town facilities. 
In the report, a transcript of a text message exchange between Howard and Cofrancesco shows that Howard didn’t want to be blamed for Mastrangelo’s continued work in a town facility after DCF and CSP launched their investigations. Howard writes, “you guys made the decision. Because that is how it happened and I want to make sure that is how it was relayed.”
The report also notes that Bethany Schools Superintendent Kai Byrd took immediate action after she learned that a report was to be filed with DCF, firing Mastrangelo as a substitute teacher and banning him from school property.

Holzberg notes that several parties were uncooperative with the Bethany investigation, including former leadership of the parks and recreation staff, whom the report accuses of deleting emails and text messages, and Connecticut State Police, which also denied Holzberg’s request to review its investigative file or provide an explanation for its delay in seeking warrants for Mastrangelo’s arrests. Cofrancesco also withheld text messages from Holzberg.
In a letter to Holzberg, Loughman cited the pending criminal case as to why police would not cooperate.
Holzberg concludes that, “the unexplained failure of the Connecticut State Police’s Bethany Troop I to seek arrest warrants for Mastrangelo in early 2023, despite having probable cause to initiate criminal proceedings arising from his assault of four victims, provided Mastrangelo an opportunity to commit a further assault in May 2024. The fifteen-month delay in seeking Mastrangelo’s arrests requires a full and candid explanation by the Commanding Officer of the CSP.”
Members of the community have called for Cofrancesco’s resignation since the report was released, including Amy Lestinsky, the mother of the fifth victim. Lestinsky helped Cofrancesco campaign for first selectman back in 2021.
“It’s super disheartening, because here I was supporting someone who I thought had the moral integrity and the know-how, and it’s all come out in black and white,” Lestinsky said. “She has none of them, and to me is not fit to run the town. I wanted her to resign last year and now, more than ever, I think she really should step down.”
Amy Rushlow, chair of the Bethany Democratic Town Committee, wrote in a post on Facebook that Cofrancesco’s “ineptitude, malfeasance, and gross neglect have no place in Bethany, especially as its leader. We call on Paula Cofrancesco to resign immediately. Our children and our town deserve better.”
Sen. Ceci Maher, co-chair of the state legislature’s Committee on Children, which has advocated for the camp licensing bill, said the report offers a clear example of why such oversight is under consideration by lawmakers.
“Not all camps operate like this. I’m hopeful that this is the exception. But something horrible happened in Bethany, and across 169 municipalities, with dozens upon dozens of different parks and recreation departments operating at different levels, it could happen again. It’s clear to me that we can do better. I look forward to seeing us do better.”

(United Methodist Health Ministry Fund/KU School of Nursing)TOPEKA — Maternity care is becoming out of reach for many in rural Kansas counties, where birth rates are higher than in urban areas, hospitals face closure and obstetrics services are few and far between.
The new report from the University of Kansas School of Nursing and Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund examined Kansas’ maternity care deserts, or counties without nearby access to prenatal and obstetrics care.
The findings “paint a stark picture of the current landscape of access to maternal health,” said David Jordan, president and CEO of the health fund, which commissioned and funded the report. The report was based on statewide data from 2022-2024.
“The data also emphasize the critical importance of addressing this challenge before it gets worse, as well as recognizing that the location of services is one piece of the puzzle,” he said.
More than 40% of Kansas counties don’t have any maternal care services, and most Kansans live 30 miles or more from a high-risk delivery facility, the report found. Plus, most rural counties in the state do not have an obstetrician/gynecologist.
In western Kansas, Grant and Wallace counties, which sit on or near the Kansas-Colorado border, have the highest birth rates in the state. Wallace County, home to roughly 1,700 people, has no hospitals, birthing centers or facilities offering prenatal services. The closest facility offering inpatient maternity care is at least 50 miles away. In Grant County, maternity care isn’t available at existing facilities, the report found, and the closest maternity care facility is at least 24 miles away. 
Labor and delivery services and high-risk care are most difficult to access, the report found. About 30% of Kansas ZIP codes are 100 miles or more from high-risk pregnancy services.
Medicaid, the joint federal and state public health insurance program, pays for about 40% of all births in Kansas. After delivery, mothers are eligible for continued coverage for a year if they make an annual income less than or equal to 171% of the federal poverty level, which amounts to $47,453 or less for a family of four. 
The report also revealed the unrecognized costs associated with providing maternity care, which requires the constant presence and attention of teams of nurses and clinicians. Reimbursement rates through public insurance programs can be lacking. 
Addressing maternal care deserts requires sound data, said Karen Weis, the lead author of the report and dean of KU School of Nursing-Salina.
“Kansas legislators, health care systems, foundations, professional organizations and educational institutions are all working hard to address the concerns of access to care and the health care workforce,” she said.
The report highlight four priorities to improve the state’s maternal health care. Providers could use telehealth more frequently as a way to expand maternal health options. Rural areas could create regional models of care so providers can more easily collaborate.
The Legislature could increase reimbursement rates for maternity care services to ease affordability concerns and retain care providers.
“Eighty-six percent of Kansas hospitals experienced a loss of services in 2023, 63% are at risk of closing and 32% are at risk of immediate closure,” the report said.
The report encouraged further engagement and research to maximize scarce resources.
Jordan said Kansas needs new, innovative solutions “to complete the puzzle in order to provide women, children and families across the state with better access to the services they need to thrive.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/25_SON_Access-to-Care_SM_Facilities_Inpatient-OB-e1747421344479-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

As the state Legislature is in the process of crafting the next state budget, economists from the University of Michigan and other experts presented research and estimations Friday on the trajectory of the national and state economies, looking at the potential impacts of federal tariffs, unemployment rates and tax revenue in order to inform lawmakers’ decisions in the budget-making process.
As the Trump administration proceeds with implementing high tariffs on imports in order to encourage consumption of domestic goods, and other countries threaten retaliatory tariffs, Yinuo Zhang and Gabriel Ehrlich of the Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics, or RSQE out of the University of Michigan, told state budget officials that Michigan is likely to be dramatically impacted.
With much of the Trump administration’s actions varying day-to-day, Ehrlich said job loss estimates due to tariffs are “very uncertain”, but as things stand now, Michigan could lose 13,000 jobs as a result of tariffs on the automotive industry as manufacturing costs increase and many of the vehicles Michigan produces see a $6,200 average increase in prices.
“Uncertainty” is the word of the day State Treasurer Rachael Eubanks said in reviewing the presentations that were given
“We are not an island. There are real and serious implications to federal trade and tax policy actions that are impacting each state uniquely,” Eubanks said. “So, we are monitoring the latest federal development continuously, which sometimes seems to change on the hour, and it can be challenging to keep up with the latest developments when you’re in the business of forecasting the revenues in the economy.”
Additionally, the result of the meeting of budget leaders of the Legislature and state called the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference, or CREC, was that lawmakers will have less funds to work with than previously estimated in the January CREC meeting.
The consensus was with state revenues on the decline, lawmakers will have about $320 million less to appropriate in the 2025-26 fiscal budget.
Analysts project modest 2025 economic growth in Michigan, while state and school revenues are up

Tensions around formulating a state budget are already high in the partisanly split state Legislature as communication between leaders of the Republican-majority House and the Democratic-majority Senate remains minimal while Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) sues House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) over Hall’s refusal to send bills leftover from the previous session to the governor’s desk for approval.
Since the current legislative session began in January, following two years of bicameral Democratic control of the Legislature, lawmakers have only gotten two bills signed into law to retain tipped wages in Michigan and implement new sick time requirements.
Earlier this week Michigan Senate Democrats passed their nearly $84.6 billion proposal for the state’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget, surpassing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s proposed $83.5 billion proposed budget.
The Senate plan, which is part of the negotiation between the House and governor in order to create a state budget, invests in schools, public safety and infrastructure, a news release from Senate Democrats Wednesday asserts.
“Our budget puts Michigan families first — plain and simple,” Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said in the news release. “It’s a reflection of what we’ve heard from residents across the state: they want good schools, safe communities, access to health care, and real opportunities to build a better life.” 
The House is still working out the details of its plans, but following CREC on Friday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in a news release budget negotiations are shaping up to be a battle for which Democrats are going to blame the Trump administration for their own thoughtless actions.
“The Senate’s own fiscal analysts are saying the budget the Democrats passed just two days ago puts Michigan into a billion-dollar deficit. And they were so proud of rushing it through without thinking,” Hall said in the release. “I’ve been telling you from the beginning that we’re negotiating with unserious people. House Republicans are going to have to be the adults in the room once again.”

(Mark Wilson | Getty Images)Unions representing workers laid off at federal health and oversight agencies are heading to Washington D.C. next week to protest past and continued cuts to their workforces by the federal government’s new Department of Government Efficiency.
In a news release Friday, the American Federation of Government Employees — which represents workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — said it will join other labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, in a protest outside the federal Department of Health and Human Services headquarters at noon on Thursday, May 22.
The unions are demanding four things, per the release:

Full reinstatement of all laid-off employees
Restoration of funding to all affected programs
An end to “retaliatory and offsetting” layoffs
Direct engagement with union leadership before any future restructuring at the federal level

The labor moves comes as several layoffs and reductions in force at the federal level under DHHS have already been rolled back. Earlier this week, a federal judge ordered DHHS to reinstate all workers at NIOSH’s Division of Respiratory Health, including employees from the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.
In Pennsylvania, NIOSH workers responsible for certifying respirators were also returned to work.
But still, hundreds of other NIOSH employees and workers from the CDC are still without jobs. Meanwhile, the work they did — some of which are the product of orders from Congress — is going unperformed.
Workers at NIOSH were first put on administrative leave in April through an agency-wide reduction in force. In early May, some were reinstated. Then they were put on leave again after only a few days. Now — through the federal court order issued in West Virginia last week — at least some workers are returning to the agency permanently.
More cuts in other departments, however, are scheduled to take effect between June and July.
The reductions in force from the federal government have been characterized as tools to reduce wasteful spending and promote efficiency within the organizations. The cuts, however, have led to numerous lawsuits, freezes in critical work, confusion and widespread concern from individuals who rely on that work to do their jobs safely.
“These layoffs are not targeting inefficiency, they are targeting science,” said Yolanda Jacobs, president of AFGE Local 2883 in Atlanta, where the CDC is based. “Public health researchers and frontline scientists are being thrown out of their jobs while the country faces growing environmental, occupational and public health crises.”
Per the release from the AFGE, work that’s stopped includes research on toxicology, exposure to certain substances, mine safety, chemical hazards, the impact of workplace oversights and more.
Several of these services that are now going undone are congressionally mandated through the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Several labor unions filed suit on May 14 against the federal government, arguing that since the cuts are stopping work that is required by Congress, they are illegal.
That was the same successful argument used in West Virginia, where coal miners filed suit against the government due to cuts at NIOSH robbing them of congressionally-mandated protections against black lung disease. The judge in that case issued a temporary injunction ordering the full restoration of staff at NIOSH’s Division of Respiratory Health.

Free.,Abrego Garcia judge questions administration’s broad use of state secrets privilege,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-judge-questions-administrations-broad-use-state-secrets-privilege,,"GREENBELT, MARYLAND — A federal judge said Friday the Trump administration has “pretty broadly” invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information on its efforts — or, the judge indicated, a possible lack of effort — to return a wrongly deported Maryland man from a prison in El Salvador.President Donald Trump’s administration moved last month to invoke the so-called state secrets privilege to shield information about its process to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States after a top immigration official admitted his removal to a prison in El Salvador was an “administrative error.”The judge handling the case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, granted an expedited discovery process after she found last month that “nothing has been done” by the administration to return Abrego Garcia.She did not make a public order regarding the state secrets privilege Friday afternoon before closing her courtroom to the public to discuss sensitive matters with attorneys for Abrego Garcia and the Department of Justice.The state secrets privilege is a common-law doctrine that protects sensitive national security information from being released. The Trump administration has argued the need to invoke it in this case to protect diplomatic relationships.‘He’ll never walk free in the United States’During the public portion of Friday’s hearing, Xinis pressed the Department of Justice attorneys about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s comment that Abrego Garica “will not return” to the U.S.“That sounds to me like an admission that your client will not take steps to facilitate the return,” Xinis said. “That’s about as clear as it can get.”DOJ attorney Jonathan D. Guynn disagreed and said the Trump administration is complying with court orders. He said Noem’s comment meant that if Abrego Garcia was back in U.S. custody he would be removed either to another third country or back to El Salvador.“He’ll never walk free in the United States,"" Guynn said.He added that the Trump administration is “currently complying and we plan to comply.”Xinis said she disagreed, and then she clashed with Guynn over the legality of Abrego Garcia’s removal.Guynn said that he was lawfully deported.Xinis answered that she found months ago that Abrego Garcia was unlawfully detained and removed from the U.S.Few documents producedOne of the attorneys for Abrego Garcia, Andrew J. Rossman, said the Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege for 1,140 documents relating to the case. From that request, Rossman said his team received 168 documents, but 132 were copies of court filings and requests made by him and his team.Xinis seemed visibly stunned by Rossman’s report and had to clarify that his team had only received 36 new documents, which Rossman confirmed.Rossman said that none of the documents for which the government is invoking the state secrets privilege are classified.“There’s ways to do this right, and they haven't done it,” he said, noting that he has attorneys on his team who have security clearances and can review classified and sensitive information.Rossman said that he and his team are seeking answers to three questions: the status of Abrego Garcia, what steps the Trump administration has taken, if any, to facilitate his return, and the steps the federal government will take, if any, to comply with court orders.Guynn said the Trump administration received an update from El Salvador on Thursday that Abrego Garcia was in “good health” and had “even gained weight.""The U.S. Supreme Court ordered that the Trump administration must ""facilitate"" the return of Abrego Garcia.Rossman, said that it’s “deeply disturbing” that administration officials, including the president, have made public statements that contradict court orders directing the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.President Donald Trump has said he could easily pick up the phone and order El Salvador to return him but won’t because he believes Abrego Garica is a member of the MS-13 gang.Noem was pressed at a May 14 congressional hearing about a photo that appears altered to add letters across Abrego Garcia’s knuckles to indicate his inclusion in the gang. She said she was unaware of it.A federal judge in the District of Columbia, in a separate case regarding Trump’s use of an archaic wartime law for deportations, questioned Department of Justice attorneys on the president’s claim that he could order Abrego Garcia to be returned. The attorney admitted that the president sometimes overstates his influence abroad.El Salvador prisonAbrego Garcia has had protections from deportation since 2019, but he was one of nearly 300 men on three mid-March removal flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador known as CECOT.Abrego Garcia has been moved to a lower security prison, according to Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to the country last month to meet with Abrego Garcia and inquire with Salvadoran officials about why he is being held there.Those officials said Abrego Garcia was being held because of the agreement between the United States and El Salvador.The U.S. has a $15 million agreement with El Salvador's government to house immigrants removed from the U.S., mostly Venezuelans removed under the wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.

The Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is a national of El Salvador and in that country’s custody and the U.S. cannot force another government to return him. Hours before Friday’s hearing, dozens of protestors gathered outside the court, calling for Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S., as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. U.S. Rep. Glenn Ivey, who represents the area in Maryland where Abrego Garcia and his family live, appeared outside the court and led chants calling for the release of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.“The president has to obey the orders of the Supreme Court,” Ivey said. “The Supreme Court has spoken here, and it's time for him to follow it and bring him home.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-05-16 17:07:53.463306

For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.

Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.




The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

The bill would initiate major changes to Vermont’s education finance and governance systems, setting in motion several years of transformation.

Phil Scott, speaks with Sen Seth Bongartz, D-Windham, right, chair of the Senate Education Committee, in a hallway at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 16. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA key Senate committee advanced the Legislature’s landmark education bill Thursday, but not before nearly every committee member vented their discomfort with the legislation. “I can’t remember ever feeling as bad about a vote as I do on this one, but it will move us forward,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, the Senate Finance Committee’s chair, told her colleagues after voting out H.454. The bill proposes generational changes to Vermont’s school governance and finance systems that would phase in over multiple years, including school district consolidation and a new education funding formula, but leaves open some key decision points for the future. Both chambers of the Legislature and Republican Gov. Phil Scott have made education reform the year’s key issue in response to last year’s double-digit average property tax increases, and all three drafted different versions of wide-ranging reforms. The Senate Finance Committee ultimately voted 5-2 to move H.454 forward. The entire Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week, and senators have signalled there may be amendments put forward on the floor. If the legislation passes, House and Senate members are expected to further negotiate over differences in a conference committee. The compromise version would then require majority approval in both chambers before being sent to the governor.Though the Senate’s current version departs from both the House’s and Scott’s packages, both chambers and the administration have broadly agreed the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. Disagreement has developed over the details and the timeline. The Senate’s version of H.454 seeks to transition the state to a foundation formula by July 2027, potentially two years faster than the House-passed bill. A foundation formula is the most common type of education funding system across the country. The approach provides districts money based on the number of students in each district and how expensive those students are to teach. Disagreement between the chambers has also developed over who should map out the potential new, larger school districts. The House proposed having Vermont public education experts suggest districts with the help of legislators; the Senate wants lawmakers to draw the lines. Both chambers agreed to have the work done over the summer for consideration in the next legislative session. The Senate nixed class size minimums, a concept in both the House’s legislation and Scott’s proposals, and adopted a different foundation formula. Compared to the House’s version, the Senate’s language also allows more currently operating independent schools to continue receiving public funding in a future, consolidated education landscape. Organizations representing Vermont’s superintendents, principals and school board members, have come out in support of the House’s draft. As a Thursday afternoon deadline to vote out the bill loomed, finance committee members voiced their frustration with aspects of the bill ranging from its pace to the details of foundation formula it proposes. “I’m extremely uncomfortable with all of this,” Sen. Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central, said, eventually joining Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, in voting “no.”Sen. Thomas Chittenden, D-Chittenden Southeast, voted to advance the bill in committee to continue its progress but said he may oppose it on the floor due in part to his concern that the timeline is too fast. Sen. Randy Brock, R-Franklin, told his colleagues that virtually everyone had something to be mad about in the bill, but inaction was a worse option. “The question is how uncomfortable you are at the prospect of these changes versus doing nothing at all,” he said. The committee’s three Republicans joined Chittenden and Cummings in approving H.454. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite discomfort, Senate committee advances landmark education bill, setting up clash with House.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/malucci-bongartz-1-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Friday announced that Pat Traynor will serve as the interim leader for Health and Human Services beginning June 2. 
Health and Human Services is North Dakota’s largest government agency. It has a two-year budget of  $5.7 billion and nearly 2,500 authorized full-time employees. The HHS commissioner is a member of the governor’s Cabinet.

“Pat Traynor is uniquely qualified to lead Health and Human Services in its mission to make North Dakota the healthiest state in the nation and promote physical, behavioral and economic health and well-being,” Armstrong said in a news release. “His track record of making organizations more efficient and effective will serve North Dakota citizens well as we continue to see high demand for the wide range of services provided by HHS.”
Traynor became president of the Dakota Medical Foundation in 2000. He previously served as executive director and CEO of the North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, now Workforce Safety and Insurance, from 1994 to 2000.
“I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to return to state government and continue serving the citizens of the state I love,” Traynor said in the release. 
Dirk Wilke has been the HHS interim commissioner since January. Wilke will continue in his position as executive director for the public health division.
Wayne Salter, the HHS commissioner under former Gov. Doug Burgum, and State Health Officer Dr. Nizar Wehbi announced in November that they would not be continuing their roles.

(Photo by Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal, via press pool)A judge has rejected efforts by former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife Glenna Bevin to keep their divorce settlement confidential, ruling in favor of their adopted son Jonah Bevin, 18, who had asked it be public.
The judge noted the high-profile divorce and Jonah’s allegations of abuse and neglect by his parents already have attracted widespread media coverage and that Matt Bevin, though no longer governor, is a public figure.
“He once held the highest office in this state,” Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson’s order said of the one-term Republican. “Whether he knew it at the time he chose to run for office, in doing so he chose to become a public figure for life.”
“Concealing the allocation of assets,” her order said, “could generate speculation about political grift or other unethical conduct.”
The Courier Journal also had argued the settlement should be public, citing his role as a public figure and his advocacy of adoption.
Matt Bevin, a business entrepreneur whose wealth was estimated in the millions when he ran for governor in 2015, and his wife have owned several houses, each valued at more than $1 million. Bevin ran on a campaign of improving foster care and adoption in Kentucky, often holding up his family as an example.
The Bevins have five biological children, all adults, and four adopted children, all but one over 18. Jonah was adopted by the Bevins at age 5 from Ethiopia along with the three other children.
  Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela J. Johnson ruled in Jonah Bevin’s favor on all measures he had sought in the pending family court case. (Photo by Michael Clevenger, Courier Journal, via press pool.)
The judge’s order noted the Bevins claimed to have provided for all their children in the divorce settlement.
Johnson, in a 22-page order released Friday, also granted Jonah’s request to intervene in the divorce case — which he had sought to protect his interests and which the Bevins had opposed.
While it might be unusual for a child to intervene in his parents’ divorce, so is this case, the judge said.
“This court would be remiss if it did not recognize this case is profoundly unique, unlike any other divorce case proceeding heard in this Commonwealth,” the order said. 
As part of the case, Jonah has obtained protective orders against his parents, alleging they abandoned him at age 17 in a brutally abusive facility in Jamaica closed last year by child welfare authorities.
Also, the judge rejected Glenna Bevin’s request to soften the terms of a restraining order against her. 
Jonhson, in her order, said terms of the protective orders were worked out in a settlement and she will not allow Glenna Bevin “to walk away from the agreement she made.”
In all, the order ruled in Jonah’s favor on all measures he had sought in the pending family court case. He has said in court  he is living on his own and spent his 18th birthday in a homeless shelter in Utah after returning to the United States from Jamaica with no assistance from his parents.
The Bevins did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dawn J. Post, a lawyer and child advocate helping represent Jonah, hailed the judge’s order as “one important step forward” in his effort to find justice and stability. She said it also helps Jonah  in his effort to give voice to other children from failed adoptions who find themselves abandoned, often in abusive facilities.
“This decision not only gives Jonah the opportunity to be heard but to stand fully in his truth after years of abandonment,” Post said.
Jonah also is represented by Louisville lawyers John H. Helmers and Melina Hettiarachi.
A key portion of the judge’s order dealt with Jonah’s education and whether he has a valid high school degree, as Matt Bevin has claimed. That determination could affect the Bevins’ further obligations to him, it said.
Jonah’s lawyers have alleged he was in and out of various out-of-state residential facilities  since age 13 and received no meaningful education, calling a diploma he received last year through an online Christian school based in Florida a “sham.”
The judge’s order notes that one of the obligations of parents under state law is to provide a child with adequate care, supervision, food, clothing, shelter and education.

Matt Bevin argued that the Florida-based Veritas Mission Academy is an accredited school in Florida. 
But the judge’s order found no reliable verification of that claim.
“As far as the court is aware, there is no reputable entity vouching for the educational standards at Veritas Mission Academy,” it said.
Jonah told the Lantern in an interview earlier this year he struggles with learning disabilities that affect his ability to read and write.
The judge said Jonah’s appearance in court led her to question his level of education, noting in court proceedings “Jonah appeared to struggle with the vocabulary and communications skills necessary to articulate his thoughts, feelings and experiences.”
“This leads the court to believe his high school education has not adequately prepared him to live his life as an independent adult,” Johnson’s order said.
The judge also addressed another question in the case — whether Jonah turned 18 last November. In a recent court hearing, Jonah’s lawyers said adoption records they recently obtained showed a discrepancy, with one indicating he might be 17.
The judge concluded he is 18, noting the discrepancy occurred in only one of several records the Bevins produced and was likely an error. Still, that doesn’t lessen his potential claims, including support, the order said, adding.
“If the court decides Jonah is entitled to some form of child support, it has the authority to craft an appropriate solution.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Bevin207-1024x727.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

Nancy Mace thanked a judge Friday for denying bond to a Greenville transgender woman accused of threatening her life, saying she and her children live in constant fear.
“My kids lives in fear of being killed. … They live in fear of their mom being shot,” Mace told reporters after the bond hearing in Greenville. “I live with that fear every day as well.”

Magistrate James Hudson denied bond to Roxie Wolfe, who is charged and booked as Samuel Theodore Cain, after Mace read a statement to the judge about feeling terrorized by transgender activists. The mother of two teenagers asked him to provide them “peace of mind” and show that South Carolina “will protect women.”
“I believe the trans movement is radicalized. It’s a cult,” Mace told Hudson, reading from her phone.
The congresswoman, who is mulling a run for governor next year, has fostered a reputation as a staunch opponent to the transgender rights movement — what she called “the so-called trans movement” — and has repeatedly used language considered slurs.
She went on to tell the judge she believes transgender people are “mentally ill” and violent.
“As a public official we accept public scrutiny. We do not accept terror,” Mace said.
Hudson then denied bond, telling Wolfe, “I do believe you are a credible threat.”

The accused 19-year-old Greenville resident asked to speak during the brief hearing, but the judge advised against it.
“We’re not here to discuss the situation or for you to defend yourself,” Hudson said.
Wolfe did not have an attorney. Hudson told her to fill out paperwork and let the court know if she needs a public defender.
There will be a second bond hearing before a Circuit Court judge, though when is not yet known. Once a bond is set, another condition will be a ban on contacting Mace in any way, Hudson said.
Wolfe was arrested Thursday for an April 26 post on X threatening to “assassinate” Mace with a gun, according to an arrest warrant from the State Law Enforcement Division.

Four days after the post, the 19-year-old admitted to federal authorities to authoring and posting the threat, the warrant said.
While the arrest warrant says Wolfe is a white male, she has identified on social media as a transgender woman, using she/her pronouns.
The maximum penalty in South Carolina for threatening the life of a public official is a $5,000 fine and five years in prison.
Wolfe is the first person charged in South Carolina with threatening Mace, but the congresswoman has publicly talked about other death threats. Last month, she said she was among the named targets of a Pennsylvania man who posted online as “Mr. Satan” as he threatened to kill President Donald Trump and “anyone who stands in the way.”
She has also cited safety concerns in explaining why she hasn’t held an in-person town hall this year.
Mace, who represents the coastal 1st District, said she didn’t know when she learned about the April 26 post on X where the possible gunman lived and had to make immediate changes to her plans.
As she stood in the hearing Friday, she told reporters afterward, “all I could think about was his family” and her children. As a mom, she said, “it was heartbreaking” to watch.
“This is a serious charge. There should be serious consequences,” Mace told reporters after the hearing. “It’s a serious matter. It’s also illegal. It’s a crime. Nobody, whether they’re elected or not, should live in fear anywhere in the country.”

(Courtesy of Howard K. Marcus)LINCOLN — Omaha will have a new mayor next month. 
Douglas County Treasurer John Ewing Jr. became the first Democrat to lead the largest city in Nebraska in roughly a decade. He is also the first elected Black mayor in the city’s history.  
Ewing won by a double-digit margin, performing better in some traditionally Republican-leaning central and western parts of the city than former State Sen. Tony Vargas did in his failed 2024 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., in the Omaha area. 
Before this week’s mayoral election, Omaha was the nation’s sixth most populated city with a Republican mayor, where Mayor Jean Stothert served three terms and sought a fourth. Ewing’s win comes after Lancaster County Democrats maintained a 6-1 majority on the Lincoln City Council earlier this month. Lincoln Democrats also have Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird.

Omaha and Lincoln are now led by Democrats in red-led Nebraska for the first time since 2009, when Omaha Mayor Jim Suttle and Lincoln Mayor Chris Beutler overlapped. 
The political dynamics of the state are bound to change with Democrats now holding leadership positions in the municipal governments of the state’s two largest cities. At the same time, the Nebraska Legislature continues to drift toward a more conservative brand of Republican — a phenomenon most associated with Southern states but also in neighboring Missouri. 
In those states, blue-led cities face a steeper climb for funding and policy changes as Republican-dominated legislatures work to undermine some of the goals pursued by Democratic mayors and City Councils. State and federal funding often get caught in the political crossfire.
One local example: Lincoln’s mayor, Gaylor Baird, and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen disagreed on where a state prison should be located in 2023. Initially, Baird said she didn’t want a prison in Lincoln, but the state threatened to put it in a residential Lincoln neighborhood until she relented on the state’s original proposed site. 
Partisan reads on situation
Partisans on both sides of the aisle saw different things in the results. The Douglas County Republican Party chair and the governor blamed low GOP turnout. The state GOP chair took a more somber view, saying she sees a changing political landscape.  
National and state Democrats were quick to use Ewing’s victory as evidence of growing voter “energy” against President Donald Trump and political fuel for the 2026 congressional midterms, as Democrats try to flip the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District House seat held by U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. 
The race also fell into some patterns from national politics in the final weeks before Election Day, as Stothert’s backers pushed an anti-transgender ad blitz, a political decision that helped Republicans in November. It was seen as a last-ditch effort to mobilize her base. It failed. 
Progressive news outlets and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha called Ewing’s victory a referendum “against trans hate and discrimination.” 
“Regular Americans don’t react to or receive the call to trans panic,” Hunt said on social media, “Enough. We are speaking to the future.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin called Ewing’s victory a “notice” for Bacon and other “vulnerable House Republicans.” Bacon’s 2nd District, which includes Douglas, western Sarpy and Saunders Counties, is typically a target of both national parties, one of the rare remaining districts that is politically split, though it still has a slight GOP lean. Democrats have won the seat before, the last time when former State Sen. Brad Ashford won in 2014. But Bacon beat him and has survived challengers since. 
He has not yet said whether he will run again in 2026, but many believe Bacon is set to retire this summer or fall, which would set off a mad scramble in both parties for an open-seat race. Democrats are lining up. Already, Omaha nonprofit executive Denise Powell has announced a bid. State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha is flirting with one. Republicans are waiting in the wings for Bacon to decide, including former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom and some Republicans with ties to City Hall.
“Voters are sick of cowardly Republicans willing to bend the knee to Trump at their expense,” Martin said. “They want true leaders who will govern on behalf of working families and not billionaire donors, which is why Democrats like John Ewing Jr. are winning elections up and down the ballot.” 
Nebraska’s 2nd District still red
Ewing’s victory joins a list of Democrats overperforming with Trump in office for a second term. But the 2nd District includes people in more Republican-leaning areas than just the Democratic-leaning city of Omaha, and they don’t vote in Omaha city elections. 
The fundamentals of the district haven’t changed, political observers say, despite national media and Democratic talk of the city election being a possible hint at bluer-leaning federal and state elections. The GOP-led majority in the officially nonpartisan Legislature drew the 2nd District boundaries after the most recent Census, partly to protect Republicans’ ability to hold the seat.  Data shows that the district’s borders give Republicans a slight advantage by replacing some Democratic-voting residents in Sarpy County with the more reliably Republican-voting residents of Saunders County.
Randy Adkins, a University of Nebraska at Omaha political science professor, said Ewing’s “upset” win — though less surprising locally than nationally — was due to numerous issues expected in a local city race, including street repairs, but it lacked a “key” issue. 
In the city of Omaha, there are more registered Democrats than Republican voters, with  114,400 registered Democrats and 95,485 registered Republicans. At last count, the other 83,187 registered voters were mostly nonpartisan, with a smaller group of Libertarians, or in the Legal Marijuana NOW Party. 
Republicans hold a registration advantage in the wider 2nd District, with 160,185 registered Republicans. Democrats are second, with 143,676 registered voters. The remaining 115,969 registered voters in the congressional district are mostly independent, or nonpartisan, and a smaller portion in either the Libertarian Party or the Legal Marijuana NOW Party, according to data from the Secretary of State’s office. 
“There are probably some people who felt it was time for a change, some who were upset about the streetcar,” Adkins said. “There were just multiple pieces along the way that led to Ewing’s victory.”
Ewing’s performance
Adkins also said Ewing had name recognition, having been elected multiple times for Douglas County Treasurer, which is a countywide position, unlike former State Sen. Mike McDonnell, a converted Republican labor leader whose Legislative District 5 only covered part of the city. McDonnell, who focused much of his criticism on Stothert, failed to advance in the mayor’s April primary despite outspending Ewing. The mayor’s race is officially nonpartisan. 
According to a Center for Politics analysis, Ewing also made significant gains in the northeastern part of the city compared to Vargas’s failed bid to unseat Bacon last year. East Omaha is home to the city’s most Democrats, and Northeast Omaha is home to the city’s handful of Black-majority precincts. 
Bacon, in contrast, ran more than eight percentage points better than Trump in Omaha in 2024, losing to Vargas by 10.4% within the city limits instead of 18.8%. Bacon also outperformed Stothert’s latest bid by at least two percentage points. 
Some might be taking the local race results too far, Adkins said, but it is “probably an early bellwether” for a more competitive race in the 2nd District, which often finishes inside of two or three percentage points. Adkins said Bacon was clearly “paying a lot of close attention” to the Omaha mayoral race.
Bacon posted praise on social media for Stothert’s mayoral tenure and congratulated Ewing. 
“She’s helped make Omaha the best place to live in America with the fastest growing economy … I’m confident her legacy will benefit the city of Omaha for decades to come,” Bacon’s post on X reads. “I congratulate John Ewing on his victory. We will work together to serve the great citizens of Omaha.” 
Omaha is changing
Leaders of local Democratic Party chapters in Lancaster and Douglas Counties said the race shows that Omaha is changing. 
Douglas County Democratic Party Chair CJ King said the race indicates that Omaha is changing and a “rejection of the MAGA principles.” In Lancaster County, home to Lincoln, county Democratic Party Chair Hannah Wroblewski said wins signal that Nebraskans are seeking practical leadership.
Nebraska Democratic Party Executive Director Precious McKesson celebrated the win as “monumental.” She said it would bring “needed diversity into the top leadership position of our city.”
Nebraska Republican Party Chair Mary Jane Truemper released a statement on the party’s losses in local races in the state’s two most populous counties, calling them a reminder that Nebraska’s “political landscapes are shifting.” 
“Voters are thinking more independently and expecting more substance from those seeking their support,” Truemper said, “We’re rethinking how we show up in every corner of the state and making it clear that Nebraskans deserve leadership rooted in real-world results, not political theater.” 
Turnout mattered
Douglas County Republican Party Chair Nancy Hicks said too few Republicans turned out to support Stothert. 
“The voters will soon be aware of the challenges that will hit Omaha with a Democratic Mayor,” Hicks said. “Republican Mayors have helped our city become such a great place to live.”
Pillen also blamed low turnout for Stothert’s loss, saying her victory should have been a “slam dunk” during a Republican watch party on Tuesday in northwest Omaha.

Turnout for Omaha’s general election was the lowest for a city general election since 2013, with around 32.1% of registered voters casting a ballot. 
For years, the conventional political wisdom has been that Republicans benefit from low turnout and off-year elections, while Democrats need to drive up turnout to win, often relying on the draw of statewide or presidential elections. Over the past three decades, Democrats have pushed to mobilize young voters, seniors and early voters to ensure high turnout. But a wave of GOP and progressive populism has taken over national politics, and, at least when Trump is on the ballot, Republicans have been benefiting more from high-turnout elections. 
Lincoln has been a “blue city” since 1999. Lancaster County’s Democratic Party chair, Wroblewski, said being a blue city with a Legislature becoming more conservative has its challenges, but it sharpens the local party’s focus. 
“We work to build strong local coalitions, find shared priorities when possible, and make it clear that constituents expect good governance,” Wroblesiki said, “Not partisanship.” 
 What’s next for Omaha?
Ewing has already leaned into the national framing of his victory with a recent MSNBC interview, saying he’s “not afraid of Trump.” 
Nebraska Republicans have gained more control of state legislation, making filibusters less effective than in the past. Democratic leaders in local governments have not yet faced a more hostile relationship, like in Texas, where the state is going after cities that have decriminalized small amounts of marijuana within city limits.   
A Republican in that supermajority, rural state Sen Loren Lippincott of Central City, said Omaha shows that the Nebraska electorate is always looking for new ideas and proves that area of the state is a “color blind” to red and blue tradition, like many political battlegrounds. He said Omaha voters look beyond labels and seek policies that serve their interests and the state. 
“Incumbents [should] watch out,” Lippincott said. 
Bacon has recently said that there are few givens in life. 
“Taxes, deaths, a competitive [Nebraska  2nd congressional district] race,” Bacon wrote on X.

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt / Source NM)Executive orders from the governor’s office show New Mexico has so far authorized over $2 million to be spent on the emergency deployment of National Guard troops to the state’s largest city, even before most people might notice their presence on the streets.
As many as 70 soldiers are expected to deploy to the city imminently, according to an April news release from the governor’s office. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham previously told Source NM troops have already started training for their new roles with the New Mexico departments of Homeland Security, Public Safety, State Police and the Albuquerque Police Department.
Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina on March 31 asked Lujan Grisham to send in “immediate reinforcement” to help his officers deal with fentanyl use and violent crimes allegedly committed by children.
Lujan Grisham on April 7 declared an emergency in the city of Albuquerque and authorized the New Mexico National Guard to spend $750,000 in order to help the Albuquerque Police Department.
The executive order states that National Guard troops would help APD with “non-law enforcement” activities including traffic control, administrative duties, transporting incarcerated people, court security, emergency response and “other critical functions that allow local law enforcement to focus on crime reduction efforts.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico denounced the move, saying that “militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations and further criminalize homelessness rather than address the root causes of public safety issues.”
The military operation is expected to cost $750,000 per month, the New York Times reported.
Lt. Gov. Howie Morales on April 17 renewed the emergency declaration and authorized another $750,000. Morales was acting governor while Lujan Grisham was traveling to Asia.
Lujan Grisham last Friday renewed the emergency again, and authorized an additional $750,000. Her executive order states that it will remain in effect until the money is spent or no longer needed.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s only public historic Black university is turning to an ally of top Republicans to lead the institution despite an overwhelming outcry from alumni, who questioned the decision to pick someone with no ties to the school or higher education experience.
The board of trustees for Florida A&M University voted, 8-4, on Friday to tap Marva Johnson as the school’s 13th president. In the same meeting, they voted to increase the salary offered to as much as $750,000, to match Johnson’s desired compensation. 
She still must be confirmed by the Board of Governors of the State University System.
The selection of Johnson continues a trend in Florida of hiring candidates due to their political connections. Florida International University hired former Lieutenant Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as president at Gov. Ron DeSantis’s urging. 
 And Florida Atlantic University trustees emphasized a desire to extract more money from the Legislature plus individual and corporate donors when they selected former GOP lawmaker Adam Hasner as the new FAU president.
Jeanette Nuñez named sole finalist in search for FIU president

DeSantis installs allies at state universities in purge of ‘ideological concepts’

Johnson is a vice president for Charter Communications who was appointed to the state Board of Education by then-Gov. Rick Scott. She holds her undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, a master’s degree from Emory University, and a law degree from Georgia State University.
While supporters of Johnson viewed her as someone whose ties to Republicans could help the school “navigate” a state government and Legislature controlled by the GOP, others questioned the decision.
“In an age of merit-based hiring decisions, how can one justify settling for a candidate who does not meet all of the position criteria, or turning a blind eye to exceptionally qualified candidates?” said Kristin Harper, the FAMU board chair, who backed a different candidate.
FAMU has been without a permanent president since Larry Robinson stepped down last year amid a probe into an embarrassing incident involving a supposed significant donation from a hemp farmer. An investigation concluded that the donation was “fraudulent.” 
The search yielded four finalists, including Washington and FAMU’s current chief operating officer, Donald Palm.
No perfect candidate
Trustee Nicole Washington, a Miami Beach education consultant, contended that “there was no one perfect candidate,” but she defended Johnson.
“The landscape of higher education is changing, and with that the role of the president,” Washington said, citing a recent American Council of Education survey of university presidents indicating that financial management and fundraising topped their job responsibilities.
Academics, Washington said, ranked No. 5 on the list.
“I respect the viewpoints expressed but, respectfully, and it’s proven by data, the skill sets and strategies that we have used to get here may not be the same strategies that it will take to move us forward. And I’m excited for new leadership who is going to be capable of navigating these complex challenges.”
Washington will wind up negotiating a contract with Johnson after the board voted to take away that responsibility from Harper. 
Harper and trustees Zayla Bryant, Belvin Perry Jr., and Craig Reid supported Palm.
Other candidates vying for the position (but who received no support) included Gerald Hector, VP for administration and finance at the University of Central Florida, and Rondall Allen, provost at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. 
Several of the FAMU trustees commented Friday that the weighty decision of naming the next president kept them up until early hours of the morning, including Trustee Kelvin Lawson, who joked that he was “not watching ESPN but reviewing the videos of the candidates instead.”  He supported Johnson and, like many of the other trustees who voted for her, said he was thinking about what the HBCU (historic black college or university) needs going forward.
“What got us here today won’t get us here tomorrow,” he said.
Negative reaction
But the hire could harm the school in the near term if alumni and others react negatively to the news.
Before the vote, the trustees heard 40 minutes of public debate; none of the speakers supported Johnson’s bid to head FAMU.
“People are tired of the vitriol, negativity, and divisiveness of politics on the national, state, and local level. Don’t do anything that will create even a hint of politically tainted prospects. Because, make no mistake, as tired as we are, a Rattler when backed up against the wall and forced to fight for its own self preservation will strike like hell for its survival,” said FAMU alum and film producer Will Parker, referring to FAMU’s mascot, a rattlesnake. “Do not underestimate the passion of this community.”
The FAMU National Alumni Association endorsed Palm. 
Curtis Johnson, director of the FAMU National Alumni Association, said he was part of the presidential search process representing the alumni. He said the association held town halls and ran surveys to hear from its members. The results showed resounding support for Palm, he said.
“It’s because he’s been there. He’s led. He understands what needs to be done to continue to elevate [the university]. And so I would implore today as you enter into your deliberations and evaluation of these candidates that you strongly consider the voice of the FAMU National Alumni Association, which supports those students on our campus and those students that are on the way to Florida A&M University.”

SPRINGFIELD — A growing number of state lawmakers are moving to repeal a 2015 Illinois law penalizing companies that boycott Israel to protest its policies toward Palestinians.

Amid concerns about Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, lawmakers in Springfield supporting human rights for Palestinians have increasingly signed on to legislation opposing the decade-old anti-boycott law. But so far, these bills have stalled.

Illinois’ 2015 law prohibits state pension funds from investing in companies engaging in the Boycott, Divest, Sanction, or BDS, movement against Israel, making Illinois the first U.S. state to enact such legislation, with dozens of other states following suit. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican, was modeled after similar post-9/11 measures restricting Illinois’ pension funds from investment in companies that engage in business with the governments of Iran and Sudan.

When boycotting Israel became grounds for blacklisting, Illinois lawmakers established the Illinois Investment Policy Board, tasked with investigating companies' investment choices. Opponents of the laws have warned they curtail free speech. Israel is the only country for which boycotting is penalized in Illinois by the board.

To repeal this policy, Rep. Abdelnasser Rashid, D-Bridgeview, introduced House Bill 2723, and Sen. Mike Porfirio, D-Bridgeview, introduced Senate Bill 2462 earlier this year. Since then, some 22 co-sponsors were added in the House and Senate, while two of those later had their names removed.

“This is about the right for people to advocate for what they believe — in this particular case, for human rights advocacy — without the state telling you what you have to believe and how you have to act,” said Rashid, the first Palestinian-American to serve in the Illinois House of Representatives. “It is a matter of making sure that Illinois is on the right side of history — not participating in the oppression of the Palestinian people – but it is also about making sure the Illinoisans and companies that do business in Illinois are not being forced and bullied and retaliated against because they chose to stand for human rights.”

Thirty companies are currently on the Illinois Investment Policy Board’s prohibited entity list for boycotting Israel.

In 2021, Unilever, for example, was added to that list after its subsidiary — ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s — announced it would stop selling its products in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as defined by the United Nations. While remaining a supporter of Israel, the company said it did not support “an internationally recognised illegal occupation.”

Chicago-based investment firm Morningstar narrowly avoided state divestment in 2022, when the Illinois Investment Policy Board accused the firm’s subsidiary, Sustainalytics, of having an anti-Israel bias. The company then commissioned an independent report that found evidence of anti-Israel bias in Morningstar’s standalone product, Human Rights Radar. Morningstar agreed to accept a series of recommendations, including discontinuing the Human Rights Radar and no longer taking input from the United Nations Human Rights Council, in order to avoid state divestment.

Wavering support

While President Trump-supporting Republicans and right-wing activists rail against a bipartisan national bill that would toughen penalties for boycotting Israel’s government, Illinois’ Democratic supermajority legislature appears hesitant to put an end to its 2015 anti-boycott law, which passed unanimously in both houses.

Rashid’s and Porfirio’s bills have stalled in committee despite the initial support from about one-fifth of the Democratic caucus, including the leaders of the Latino, Black and Progressive caucuses.

Thousands of bills, the vast majority of those proposed, get stuck in the Rules Committee every year for various reasons. In HB 2723’s case, the holdup can be attributed in part to the political costs of supporting the bill, advocates said.

Sen. Napoleon Harris, D-Harvey, was listed as a cosponsor on March 20, and Sen. Adriane Johnson, D-Buffalo Grove, signed onto the bill on April 2, but both had their names removed on April 8. Neither senator responded to a request for comment on their reasoning.

Porfirio, the Senate bill’s chief sponsor, and its chief cosponsors — Karina Villa, D-West Chicago; Graciela Guzmán, D-Chicago, and Rachel Ventura, D-Joliet — all declined or failed to respond to requests for comment.

“Even though it had quite an impressive list of sponsors and cosponsors, it's a controversial piece of legislation that is likely to engender a lot of debate that most legislators don't want to vote on, because they either have Jewish or Palestinian constituents, or both,” said Dick Simpson, a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago and former Chicago alderman. “Why should they vote on something that isn't going to pass and then cause some constituents to be mad at them?”

But Deanna Othman, member of the Chicago chapter of American Muslims for Palestine, said HB 2723 is urgent, citing both a humanitarian crisis and a crisis of free speech.

“Unfortunately, it's more relevant now than ever, because we've seen all of the crackdown on student protesters and people who engage in boycott and people who are just voicing their First Amendment rights,” Othman said. “If I cannot stand up for the rights of my fellow Palestinians, whose rights can I stand up for?”

‘It’s impossible to tell if this bill will ever pass’

Activists say they are hopeful a repeal of the anti-BDS law will pass in 2026 if it continues to stall this year. But it remains an uphill battle, even as they point to a steady decrease in American popular support for Israel.

About 53% of Americans express an unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a Pew Research Center study conducted last month. This is an increase from March 2022, when that figure was 42%.

The survey found the share of Americans with little or no trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “do the right thing for global affairs” increased significantly from 2023 to 2024. Since Oct.  7, over 52,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli attacks, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza. An estimated 1,200 people were killed in Israel during the Hamas’s attacks on Oct.  7, 2023, and around 250 Israelis were taken hostage.

The pro-Israel, pro-peace advocacy group J Street does not oppose boycott initiatives “that explicitly support a two-state solution and recognize Israel’s right to exist,” according to a statement of its policies. “It is critical to maintain the distinction between boycott efforts that work against the interests of Israel, and initiatives which are limited to opposing the occupation. We neither oppose nor call for these initiatives,” the group said in a statement.

But J Street does oppose the broader Global BDS Movement, which advocates for three tenets: That Israel should stop policing the border on and occupying legally Palestinian land, that Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel should have full equality with Jewish citizens and that Palestinians be allowed to return to their homes, as stipulated in UN Resolution 194.

Lesley Williams, an activist with Evanston Ceasefire who has been lobbying to repeal Illinois’ anti-BDS law, said the three tenets don’t mean “Israel needs to stop existing.”

“That doesn't mean that non-Palestinians should be forced to leave Israel,” she said. “It just says the Palestinians should have equal rights in that territory and that Israel should be following United Nations resolutions.”

The original sponsor of the 2015 anti-BDS law in the House, then Rep. (now Sen.) Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, declined several requests for comment. However, when a 2022 Crain’s Chicago Business op-ed criticized Feigenholtz’s legislation, arguing it was “raising the specter of McCarthy-like scrutiny.” Feigenholtz issued a statement defending her law.

“Israel is the singular democracy in the Middle East that has historically been a consistent ally to the United States,” Feigenholtz said at the time. “Boycotts of Israel, like Ben & Jerry’s/Unilever, are intended to harm and weaken Israel.” She added, “No one’s free speech is curtailed.”

Ben and Jerry’s co-founders Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who no longer run the company, denied the boycott was anti-Israel or antisemitic in a 2021 op-ed. They said it was merely a rejection of Israeli policy, and that Ben and Jerry’s was in fact advancing justice and human rights, both “core tenets of Judaism.”

Given the controversy surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian divide, many political obstacles to these current bills passing will probably remain next year. Politicians are less likely to discuss controversial issues like the BDS movement when there’s a supermajority of one party — in Illinois’ case, Democrats — for fear of factionalizing, said Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.

Even if a repeal of the anti-BDS law makes it through the legislature, Gov. JB Pritzker may still be an obstacle, Burge added.

“Pritzker is going to try to run for president in 2028, and he doesn't want anything to happen in the GA that could be used as an albatross on his neck when he runs for the primary in a couple years,” Burge said. Should anti-BDS legislation reach Pritzker’s desk, “The Governor will carefully review this piece of legislation,” the governor’s press secretary, Alex Gough, said in an email.

“It’s impossible to tell if this bill will ever pass, and the reason for that is it's impossible to predict where the Israeli and Palestinian war will be next year,” Simpson said. “I don't know, if Israel does carry through on its threats to move all the Palestinians out of Gaza and to permanently take control, that might provide enough anger to cause it to pass. But it is just predicting.”

(Alaska Energy Authority image)With urban Alaska facing a shortfall in the natural gas long used to generate the vast majority of its power, renewable energy advocates have been pressuring the region’s utilities to advance large-scale wind and solar development to meet future power demands.
But no such projects have been built in the past few years, even with generous tax credits available from the federal government. And now, the utilities are pitching the idea of cutting their dependence on gas by resurrecting a dormant but divisive megaproject: a huge hydroelectric dam along the Susitna River estimated, a decade ago, to cost $5.6 billion.
The pitch, sent to three key budget-writing members of the state House, came earlier in May in a formal letter from the heads of Anchorage-based Chugach Electric Association, Kenai Peninsula-based Homer Electric Association, Fairbanks-based Golden Valley Electric Association, Matanuska Electric Association and Seward’s municipally run electric utility.
[Read the letter]
“In an era when Alaska is facing production declines and difficulty securing natural gas, pursuing energy projects with proven technology, like hydro, provides the utilities with additional generation options while preserving existing natural gas resources,” the executives wrote. They added: “We need multiple options to solve the biggest issue impacting Alaska utilities today: fuel availability.”
The Susitna hydroelectric project has been contemplated, off and on, for decades, before development was suspended by former Gov. Bill Walker in 2016 amid a state budget crisis. 
The project could generate 50% of urban Alaska’s electricity demand, according to the state agency that’s led the study process, the Alaska Energy Authority.
The letter from the utility executives asks the three co-chairs of the House Finance Committee to revive the state’s partially completed efforts to secure a federal license for the project. 
Officials estimate that finishing the licensing process could cost as much as $100 million, on top of some $200 million that’s already been spent.
Lawmakers are nearing the end of their annual budget writing process, and amid declining state revenue, they haven’t added any cash for the hydro project yet.
They’re also still considering legislation to require the utilities to generate higher amounts of power from renewable sources by target dates.
Reached between meetings Wednesday, Anchorage Rep. Calvin Schrage, one of the letter’s recipients, declined to comment.
The utilities’ request to revive the Susitna project is exasperating advocates for other forms of renewable energy, who say that hydroelectric development is economically and politically unrealistic given its huge cost and potential impacts to the river’s yearly runs of hundreds of thousands of salmon.
“It feels like an unfortunate distraction from the urgent work that we need to be doing to secure affordable energy,” said Alex Petkanas, climate and clean energy program manager at the Alaska Center, a conservation group. “We have the studies and the information we need about wind power in Alaska, wind availability in Alaska, and wind reliability. So, to see them spending time on a controversial project rather than pursuing solutions like wind energy that are within our reach feels like a mistake.”
Hydroelectric projects like the Susitna development appeal to utility executives because they provide what’s known as “dispatchable” power — electricity that’s available whenever it’s needed. 
The utilities have expressed more skepticism about wind and solar developments because of their variability, though a recent study commissioned by the utilities found that urban Alaska’s grid could boost its use of wind power seven-fold without jeopardizing reliability.
The next step for the hydroelectric project wouldn’t require the full amount of cash to secure the federal license, said Curtis Thayer, the energy authority’s executive director. Instead, he said, lawmakers would have to budget “a few million dollars” to better understand how much work is needed before the license could be issued. 
“We need to spend a little bit of money to refresh all those numbers to really decide if this is a viable project to move forward,” Thayer said. He asserted that the billions of dollars that would be required for construction is “not an issue,” because private investment firms would finance the project in exchange for guaranteed returns.
For developments that have received federal licenses, “there are people that are standing in line to invest,” Thayer said.
The Susitna proposal faces intense opposition from conservationists and some residents along the river, who say that the development would harm salmon by dramatically reducing water flow in the summer, when power demand is lower, and artificially boosting it during the winter, when demand is high.

	The Susitna River Coalition, a nonprofit that’s led efforts to block the dam, says its construction would cause the “eradication” of the river’s “unique ecosystems, the destruction of one of Alaska’s most valued salmon spawning and rearing habitats, and the flooding of 40,000 acres teeming with wildlife, while costing the state billions of dollars that are needed elsewhere.”
Critics of hydroelectric development point out that elsewhere in the United States, dams are being removed, not built, because of their harmful effects on salmon and other migratory fish species. They also say that construction costs regularly exceed projections.
Opponents of the Susitna project also questioned the process that led to the letter being drafted and sent by the executives of the cooperatively owned utilities, which are governed by citizen boards of directors. 
Those opponents said that not all the utility executives had consulted with board members before the letter was sent — an assertion that two members confirmed to Northern Journal, though they asked to remain anonymous to describe internal conversations.
“Utility staff should not be contacting the Legislature or taking positions without board knowledge or approval,” said Petkanas.
A spokesperson for the largest urban utility, Chugach Electric Association, could not be reached for comment Wednesday, while the spokesperson for the next-largest, Matanuska Electric Association, did not respond to a request for comment.
But Mark Wiggin, board chair of Chugach Electric Association, said he was informed about the letter in advance.
“There’s an overarching interest by all of us to find some way to maintain our energy grid,” Wiggin said. “However we do that, without having to import all that gas, would be a good thing.”

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.The Minnesota Court of Appeals will review whether the state may prosecute tribal members for cannabis crimes on most Native reservations in the state, wading into new legal territory after the state legalized recreational cannabis in 2023.
The case involves a White Earth citizen, Todd Thompson, who faces a felony charge for selling marijuana from his tobacco store in Mahnomen on the White Earth reservation.
Mahnomen County sheriff’s deputies and White Earth tribal police raided his store on Aug. 2, 2023, a day after recreational cannabis became legal in Minnesota, and seized about 7.5 lbs of cannabis, 433 grams of marijuana wax and $2,748 in cash along with Thompson’s cell phone and surveillance system.
More than eight months after the raid, Mahnomen County charged Thompson with felony possession, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Thompson asked Mahnomen County District Judge Seamus Duffy to dismiss the charge, arguing that the state doesn’t have the legal jurisdiction to prosecute him.
Under what’s called Public Law 280, Minnesota has the power to prosecute tribal members on certain reservations including White Earth’s for criminal acts, but not civil or regulatory violations of state law. Thompson and his attorney, Claire Glenn, argued that after cannabis was legalized in Minnesota, possessing and selling the drug became a regulatory matter, not a criminal one.
Thompson also argued that prosecuting him for possession of cannabis violated his rights under the United States’ 1855 Treaty with the Ojibwe, which guarantees the Ojibwe usufructuary rights to hunt, fish and gather on ceded lands.
The district court judge ruled that the state did have jurisdiction, allowing the case to proceed. He held that the matter was criminal and that treaties guarantee rights to tribes, not individuals.
Typically, criminal cases can only be appealed after a conviction, which raised the prospect that Thompson could be forced to go to prison before being able to appeal the judge’s ruling.
Thompson’s attorney, Claire Glenn, asked the Court of Appeals to make an exception and review the jurisdiction matter because his case presents new legal questions that will have implications for Native tribes and tribal members across the state. The appeals court judges agreed.
“A decision on the jurisdiction of the state to enforce Minnesota’s cannabis-possession laws and on the extent of the rights reserved under applicable treaties will have an immediate statewide impact on all Tribes in Minnesota subject to Public Law 280 and on their members,” Chief Judge Jennifer Frisch wrote in the opinion on behalf of herself, and Judges Randall Slieter and Rachel Bond.
Glenn praised the decision, noting how rare it is for the Court of Appeals to intervene in the middle of criminal cases.
“We’re very encouraged by that, but obviously we have a ways to go,” she said.
Both sides must now submit written briefs before oral arguments will be scheduled.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P1140782-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 16:07:49.411823

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone III could be the deciding factor in whether the state passes an assault-style weapons ban this year.
Unless he’s not allowed to be part of the discussion.
The Rhode Island Ethics Commission is slated to issue an advisory opinion at its meeting Tuesday on whether Ciccone’s status as a federal firearms dealer prevents him from participating in deliberations and decisions on gun-related bills. Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, requested the advice of the state ethics panel in an April 30 letter, one day after he was selected Senate majority leader by a majority of his Democratic peers.
Gun bills draw a crowd to R.I. State House for seven and a half hours of testimony

It’s the first time the 77-year-old lawmaker has sought an ethics opinion regarding his ability to influence gun-related policies, despite having served in office since 2003, and held a Class 1 federal firearms license since the 1980s, The Providence Journal reported.
Ciccone did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment Friday.
However, in an April interview, he downplayed the significance of his firearms business, based out of his home in Silver Lake. Ciccone said he only sells one gun per year, usually to a friend or family member. In his letter to the ethics panel, obtained by Rhode Island Current, Ciccone further made the case for why his side hustle should not force him to step out of discussions or votes on gun bills, invoking an exemption within the state’s own ethics laws.
The ethics panel’s response could sway the outcome of the biggest issue on Smith Hill this year. Ciccone has already made it clear he doesn’t support the assault-style weapons ban, at least as drafted by Senate sponsor Lou DiPalma. But Senate President Valarie Lawson is one of the bill’s co-sponsors. 
Lawson and Ciccone serve as ex-officio members on all Senate committees, and could cast tie-breaking votes to determine whether the bill advances out of the 10-member Senate Committee on Judiciary — similar to the power exerted by former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and former Majority Leader Ryan Pearson to advance a contested abortion access bill to the floor in 2023.
Invokes ‘class exemption’
The ethics code states that there is no substantial conflict of interest if an elected official or person in decision-making authority does not benefit, or lose out, to a “greater extent” than anyone else in their business, profession, occupation or other type of affected group. 
The Ethics Commission has relied on this clause in previous decisions, granting, for example, approval for a state lawmaker who owns a fire alarm installation business to vote on legislation related to credit requirements for fire suppression systems, and for a lawmaker married to a dentist to vote on a bill regulating dentistry. 
Last year, the ethics panel ruled that Lawson, then the Senate majority whip, could vote on pension-related changes despite her job as president of one of the state’s two largest teachers’ unions. It concluded that Lawson would not benefit any more or less from pension changes than the other 68,000 retirees and active state workers and teachers, including 400 of her union co-workers.
The ethics panel in 2002 gave similar advice to Ciccone when he asked for an opinion on potential conflicts on pension bills, given his career with the Laborers’ International Union of North America and participation in the state retirement system.
Ciccone contended the same logic should be applied to his ability to vote on gun bills, noting that there are 70 licensed federal firearms dealers across the state.
“Although this may appear to be a small group, it comprises the entire industry within the State,” Ciccone wrote in his letter. “Consistent with the ‘class exemption’ set forth in [state law], “no substantial conflict exists where the individual members of an entire group are impacted equally.”
Ciccone also wrote that if a separate bill that only impacted a subset of federal firearms dealers were to be brought forward, he would seek a separate advisory opinion, or recuse himself from the vote.
John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, said the size of an affected group is one of several variables considered in a potential conflict of interest. For example, the panel in many prior opinions stressed the importance of “the function or official action being contemplated by the public official” and “the nature and degree of foreseeable impact upon the class and its individual members as a result of the official action,” in determining if a class exemption was applicable. 
“The Ethics Commission’s work is very fact-specific, and without knowing all the facts involved in both legislation and his business, it’s hard to prejudge,” Marion said in an interview. “Like many things in our ethics law, it doesn’t hang on a single number.”
What took him so long?
Noting Ciccone’s long history in state politics and votes on other gun-related bills such as safe storage requirements — signed into law in 2024 despite Ciccone’s vote against it — Marion said Ciccone should have likely sought an ethics opinion years ago.
Especially because Ciccone has run afoul of state ethics rules before. In 2008, Ciccone was fined $1,500 for failing to report his positions as a state senator and a union consultant on 2005 and 2006 financial statements.
However, Marion acknowledged that Ciccone’s recent ascension to the Senate leadership team would warrant a new ethics opinion, even if he’d already requested advice in the past.
Three Democrats who serve on the Senate Judiciary committee voiced opposition to the assault-style weapons ban legislation during a preliminary hearing Wednesday, while a fourth, Republican Sen. Thomas Paolino, has previously indicated he also does not support the bill.
Gov. Dan McKee and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi are both backing the assault weapons ban, with McKee making his priority clear by also including the policy change in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget.

After being added this week to a miscellaneous education bill, phone-free school legislation could make it to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of this legislative session.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ban on smartphones in schools picks up steam in Vermont Legislature.","Stock photo by cottonbro studio via PexelsVermont is on track to join a growing list of states that have banned smartphones from the classroom.This week, lawmakers in a key committee advanced legislation that would require all of the state’s public school districts and independent schools to develop policies prohibiting students from using smartphones and other personal devices like smartwatches during the school day. The policies would need to take effect by the 2026-2027 school year.A school cell phone ban was previously introduced in a standalone bill that has failed to move forward this legislative session. But on Thursday members of the Senate Committee on Education voted to graft the ban onto H.480, a miscellaneous education bill that includes several smaller adjustments to Vermont’s education laws. Now, with broad support in both chambers, lawmakers hope to send the bill to Gov. Phil Scott’s desk by the end of the session. The miscellaneous education bill is expected to soon hit the Senate floor before returning to the House, which needs to approve the new amendment to the bill.  “I feel like I still have to reserve a little caution, because there are still a couple steps, and things can always change,” Rep. Angela Arsenault D-Williston, the lead sponsor of H.54, said in an interview. “But when it passes, I’m going to feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for everyone involved and making it happen, and relief for our kids and our teachers.”  In Vermont, a broad spectrum of advocates have said that a ban on smartphones and similar devices would go a long way toward alleviating soaring rates of depression, anxiety and other mental health issues among students. “Our students are struggling mentally, socially (and) academically,” Benjamin Clark, a teacher at the Frederick H. Tuttle Middle School in South Burlington, told lawmakers this week while speaking in support of the measure. “And while there are many causes, one cause stands out clearly: the omnipresence of personal technology during the school day.” The legislation would also prohibit schools from using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to communicate with students or from otherwise requiring students to have social media to engage in school activities. According to Arsenault, Vermont would be the first state in the country to adopt such a ban. “It’s really a recognition that social media is not good for kids and that schools and educators should not be signaling that it is,” she said.Mounting concerns about the emotional and cognitive impacts of smartphone and social media use among children have fueled a nationwide movement to limit the use of personal devices in schools.Already 21 states have enacted laws either requiring districts to adopt phone-free policies or outright banning phones in public schools statewide. Nine other states, meanwhile, either recommend policies or incentivize districts to ban devices by providing state funding for pilot programs. Many countries have also put into place nation-wide versions of a classroom smartphone ban, including France, Italy, and Brazil. Vermont could follow suit by the end of the year. Assuming lawmaker’s do pass H.480, the bill will go before Republican Governor Phil Scott, who has signalled his interest in taking smartphones out of the classroom.In a written statement, Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, said that although the Governor had not yet reviewed the specific language included in the miscellaneous education bill, he “has generally been supportive of phone-free school policies.” “We often hear phones in the classroom (and in professional settings, for that matter) can be distracting,” Wheeler said, “so by implementing these policies, which some schools have already done, it helps students to focus on learning.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ban on smartphones in schools picks up steam in Vermont Legislature.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pexels-cottonbro-studio-5081920-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-16 15:03:33.190114

Yost said he has enjoyed traveling around the state engaging with Ohioans in his bid to succeed term-limited Governor Mike DeWine, but “it is also apparent that a steep climb to the nomination for governor has become a vertical cliff.”
“I do not wish to divide my political party or my state with a quixotic battle over the small differences between my vision and that of my opponent,” Yost wrote, seeming to refer to fellow candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. “I am simply not that important.”

Yost said the state “has challenges ahead” and Columbus “needs re-engineering, not demolition.” He warned of a “comeback attempt” by former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown that could “unwind all of the good that the last 15 years of Republican leadership has brought.”
“This is a time to protect Ohio, not a time for a family squabble,” Yost wrote.
Brown has not formally announced any bid for elected office, but former Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton has already thrown her hat in the ring to vie for the governor’s seat as a Democrat.
Yost, whose term as state attorney general runs until Jan. 2027, plans to “continue to fight for Ohio and Ohioans” for the rest of his tenure, but “I suspect that this is not my final chapter,” he told supporters.

Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie sponsored the measure. He said it was “personal” for him, having observed homeowners’ frustrations dealing with their local governments in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall.
After the Senate initially passed the bill last month, he issued a statement saying that, following a major storm, citizens need a “clear path to recovery, not roadblocks.”
“When local bureaucracy overshadows the needs of citizens, Floridians are left picking up the pieces,” he said. “We’re fighting for families to focus on rebuilding without additional delays or burdens, especially for those who sustained damage or lost their homes. Working with our state and local responders, we can streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination, fortifying and strengthening our communities before the next storm.”
The bill contains more than a dozen provisions affecting everything to do with emergency management preparedness and response, as described during a Zoom conference call Thursday organized by the Florida League of Cities,
Perhaps most controversially for local governments is that it prohibits a county or a city located entirely or partially within 100 miles of a hurricane’s track from proposing or adopting moratoriums on construction, reconstruction, or redevelopment of any property.
It also prohibits adopting a “more restrictive or burdensome amendment” or “burdensome procedure” to their comprehensive plans or land development regulations concerning review, approval, or issuance of a site plan, development permit, or development order until Oct. 1, 2027, applied retroactively to Aug. 1, 2024.
“You may be asking what is ‘burdensome’ and what is ‘more restrictive?’ said Matt Singer with the League, who cited a lack of a clear definition as the reason the League opposed the measure.
‘A lot of legal uncertainty’
The bill allows for a “cause of action,” meaning citizens and/or business owners would be able to challenge any local update on the ground that it is burdensome or more restrictive to them.
“And so it’s really, really important that you check this language and see if any of your local updates that have already been made would be affected, and whether’s there’s any liability created there,” Singer said.
“As a result of that, there’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” he said, adding that the League worked closely with DiCeglie and the House bill (HB 1535) sponsor, Sarasota Republican Fiona McFarland, to have that provision removed, but it was ultimately placed back in the House bill.
That provision is already drawing attention from local lawmakers who say that it could prevent them from making changes to prevent future flooding from storms.
“It affects every county and every city in the state that you can’t control the way that you’re developing and the way that you’re managing your own land,” Volusia County Commission Chairman Jeff Brower told WESH-TV in Orlando this week. “And local governments should be doing that.”
Special procedures
The bill requires local governments to develop post-storm permitting plans to expedite recovery and rebuilding by providing for special building permitting and inspection procedures following a hurricane or tropical storm. Plans must include adequate staffing for building inspection, permitting, and enforcement and provide multiple locations offering building permit services.
The measure says that local governments participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) may not adopt what is known as a “lookback” period. That means any work completed on a house within a specified period (which can be as long as 5+ years) when determining what counts towards FEMA’s 50% rule. The NFIP’s 50% Rule states that repairs made to a home in a designated flood zone cannot exceed 50% of the home’s market value unless the entire structure is brought into full compliance with current flood regulations.




Singer did tell members of the League that “there are positive things in this bill,” specifically a $5,000 penalty for breach of contract for goods and services during a storm.




“This is in response to some local perspectives that we were able to share with the legislators where cities have had contracts in place with debris removal, and contractors unfortunately just no-show, no-call, and go to another place where they can get some more money,” he said.
“The bottom line here is that Senate bill 180 would reshape many aspects to municipal emergency response across the board, and it imposes a lot of new planning and publication duties,” Singer added.
The measure has yet to be sent to Gov. DeSantis desk.

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)Greenpeace wants a North Dakota judge to reduce the nearly $667 million in damages it was ordered to pay the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline in March, arguing that the award is excessive and unreasonable.
A Morton County jury handed down the sum following a more than three-week trial earlier this year. Jurors found the environmental group at fault for damages related to protests against the pipeline in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, and for publishing defamatory statements that harmed Energy Transfer’s business.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed the movement, which drew thousands to rural south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Greenpeace denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the company only brought the lawsuit to chill environmental activism. The defendants have yet to appeal.
In the meantime, attorneys for Greenpeace have asked Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion to slash the nearly $667 million award, claiming it exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
“This is the poster child of where the court needs to step in,” Steven Caplow, an attorney representing Greenpeace, said in a Thursday morning remote hearing.
 

Energy Transfer says Gion should let the jury’s award stand. Trey Cox, an attorney representing the pipeline developer, called the damages “consistent with the evidence produced at trial and the law of the state of North Dakota.”
In North Dakota, a punitive damage award cannot exceed two times the compensatory damage award, or the amount granted to make up for financial losses a party suffered.
Greenpeace and Energy Transfer disagree as to whether the verdict meets this requirement. Caplow argued that the punitive damages must be reduced by roughly $43 million to be consistent with state law, while Cox said the damages don’t exceed the cap and ought to be left in place.
Greenpeace also claims the award includes costs that should actually be attributed to Energy Transfer or other third parties. Greenpeace maintains it only had six employees visit the protest camps, and that its presence was small compared to the many other activist groups that supported the movement.
Caplow argued that Energy Transfer without sufficient evidence is holding Greenpeace responsible for all damages the company incurred in connection to the protests. He said the award unfairly compensates Energy Transfer for expenses it sustained before any Greenpeace employees set foot in North Dakota, for example.
Greenpeace also alleges the jury form — which the jurors had to fill out to issue their verdict — was flawed in a way that inflated the damages attributed to the environmental group.
Before the jurors deliberated, Gion directed them to consider whether each damage Energy Transfer claimed was directly caused by Greenpeace, or whether and to what extent they resulted from the actions of another group. Despite this being part of the instructions, there wasn’t space on the form for the jury to conduct this analysis, Caplow said.
That meant jurors were deprived of an opportunity to voice whether they believe Energy Transfer or other groups shared responsibility for any of the $667 million award, Caplow argued.
Cox said Greenpeace could have proposed changes to the form to address this issue, but didn’t.
Greenpeace also asked Gion to remove hundreds of millions of dollars of defamation-related damages, claiming the award is not supported by the evidence presented at trial. The jury awarded Energy Transfer damages for statements Greenpeace published about the pipeline between November 2016 and June 2018.
The environmental group maintains that none of the statements are defamatory, but also says that even if they were, they cannot be held solely responsible for defamation. Greenpeace says the statements originated with other sources — including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe — and were circulated by hundreds of other outlets well before it published anything about the pipeline.
Additionally, Greenpeace says a significant portion of the $667 million includes compensation for damages Energy Transfer did not formally request relief for, including some Greenpeace says the company referenced during trial but didn’t claim in its written complaint.
Energy Transfer disputes the notion that Gion has discretion to reduce the jury’s award.
Energy Transfer’s lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities — Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund. Greenpeace USA was found at fault for most of the claims brought by Energy Transfer. The jury did not find Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund responsible for on-the-ground harms committed by protesters, though it did find those entities responsible for defamation and interfering with Energy Transfer’s business. Additionally, the jury found Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International liable for conspiracy.
Matt Kelly, an attorney representing Greenpeace Fund, said during Thursday’s hearing that the award against the organization should be tossed out. The jury ordered Greenpeace Fund to pay roughly $130 million despite the fact that it did not find the organization at fault for most of the major claims in the case, Kelly said.
“We were forced to litigate for seven years on claims where there was no basis for any liability against Greenpeace Fund,” Kelly said during the hearing. “The idea that we should be forced to bear those costs, at this point, is ridiculous.”
Greenpeace International in court filings argued similarly that the nearly $132 million in damages it was ordered to pay should be dropped.
Energy Transfer says that the awards are valid because the jury found both of the organizations at fault for interfering with the company’s business.
Gion took the motion under advisement. Greenpeace in separate motions has asked Gion to fully reverse the jury’s verdict. The parties are scheduled to reconvene for another hearing on May 27.
Greenpeace USA has announced its intent to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

“I especially worry about how senior Michiganders will fare under the legislation Congressman James voted for this week,” said Dr. Christine Crader, a palliative medicine physician from St. Clair Shores, which is in James’ district. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Crader was among physicians from across the country, including from Colorado, Iowa, and New Jersey, who spoke during a virtual press event Thursday to criticize their representatives for voting for the bill in committee and urge them to cease any further support for the legislation. 
The event was sponsored by the Committee to Protect Health Care, a PAC that supports an expanded health care system.
Crader says the legislation won’t just result in depriving Medicaid recipients of health care coverage, it will also raise health care costs for many people, including seniors.

“Many poor, older and disabled people are enrolled in Medicare but use Medicaid to cover copayments they cannot afford. So if their Medicaid is taken away, as it could be under the legislation Congressman James voted for, these seniors and disabled people might not be able to pay their co-payments or other costs,” Crader said.
Michigan Democratic Party Curtis Hertel was less restrained in his criticism, calling James “a disgrace” to the state and the millions of Michiganders that rely on Medicaid. 
“The worst part is, all of these cuts that rip away health care from people who need it, is all to give the richest 1% yet another tax break,” Hertel said. 
A request was sent by Michigan Advance to James’ office, but has yet to be returned.
However, James, who is a Republican candidate for governor in 2026, has said in the past that Republicans are working to protect Medicaid from insolvency to “ensure those who’ve rightfully paid into their benefits & our most vulnerable can access these essential programs.” 
An analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that the proposed Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next decade, resulting in approximately 10.3 million people losing access to either Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Additionally, 7.6 million people would become uninsured during the 10-year budget window.
Michigan League for Public Policy President and CEO Monique Stanton said the cuts being made to Medicaid spending as well as to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are part of an overall tax plan that would increase deficits by $3.8 trillion over 10 years, 
“To put life-saving programs like Medicaid and SNAP on the chopping block in order to create tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy is egregious,” Stanton said.

“Everything that we know is critical to Michigan’s growth — bringing down maternal mortality rates, making sure older folks can afford their prescriptions, making sure kids and families have the nutrition they need — that’s all at stake now. And for what? To make sure more wealthy people get a tax cut,” Stanton said.
Also criticizing the proposed cuts to the Medicaid program is Danielle Atkinson, executive director and founder of Mothering Justice, a Michigan-based policy organization.
“These proposed funding cuts Republicans are trying to push through would devastate working-class families and mamas of color in Michigan. This is a class war being declared on some of our most vulnerable populations by out-of-touch politicians who won’t be impacted by this political malpractice. I call on the Michigan congressional delegation to vote against these cuts, and to step up and protect low-income families and communities of color,” Atkinson told the Advance.
A major piece of the Republican-sponsored legislation is the implementation of work requirements for those on Medicaid, which the CBO estimates would save more than $300 billion over the next ten years. Democrats have countered that the vast majority of recipients work full or part-time, and the savings will be realized through red tape that will cut off benefits to those who otherwise qualify.
Crader says she has seen that first-hand among her patients.
“We had challenges in Michigan when people had to reconfirm and go through all of the paperwork to qualify again for Medicaid and I had at least two patients in my clinic who for a period of time were without insurance and were worried that they were not going to be able to see me as a physician, that they were not going to be able to pay for pain medications that they were taking for Stage 4 cancer,” Crader said.
She also said while the political battle plays out in Washington D.C., many of her patients don’t yet grasp the changes the proposed legislation will bring.
“I don’t feel that my patient population really understands the impact of these Medicaid cuts. I’m not sure they believe it will actually happen because all of them wonder how could humans do this to other humans,” Crader said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-16-140430.png,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — In what appeared to be a campaign stump speech in all but name only, state Superintendent Ryan Walters called to eliminate Oklahoma’s income tax and property tax and said the state should stop increasing funding for public schools.
Walters, who leads the statewide public education system, said Oklahoma should slash administrative spending across state government. Finding these efficiencies, he claimed, would make up for the many millions of dollars public schools would lose if the state stops collecting income and property taxes.
“People love to throw around how much money you spend in education,” Walters said in a surprise news conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “I don’t want to be a leader in how much money we spend on education. I’ll make that clear. I do not want to be that leader.”

Walters, a Republican long thought to be a potential gubernatorial candidate, spent much of the news conference criticizing the state budget Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders announced Wednesday. He took questions from reporters for 40 minutes while a small group of his supporters cheered him on.
When asked directly whether he intends to run for governor, Walters said that’s a “question I’ll look at over the summer.” 
If Walters launches a campaign, he would join a 2026 Republican primary race of Attorney General Gentner Drummond, former House Speaker Charles McCall, former state Sen. Mike Mazzei and Leisa Mitchell Haynes, of Choctaw. House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, is the only non-Republican in the race to succeed Stitt, who will be term-limited.
“My focus is the school year and this legislative session,” Walters said. “We still have time this legislative session to get it right.”
The offices of House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, declined to comment on Walters’ remarks. The Governor’s Office did not return a request for comment.
Their $12.6 billion budget deal cuts the state’s top income tax bracket by .25% and eliminates three lower tax brackets — a measure Walters said doesn’t go far enough to support working Oklahomans. Stitt had urged lawmakers to cut the income tax by a half a percentage and to chart a path to eliminating the income tax altogether.
The budget includes a 3.15% increase to the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s budget and gives $25 million more to public schools.
Despite saying on Friday that he wants “less money going to our agency,” Walters had asked at the beginning of the legislative session for a 2.43% funding increase to the education budget.

He had specifically requested $3 million to buy Bibles for public school classrooms, $1 million for a new teacher induction program, $1 million to recruit military veterans and former law enforcement officers to become teachers, and $500,000 to give educators concealed-carry firearms training. None of these proposals made it into the state budget that lawmakers and the governor crafted.
However, state leaders agreed to boost a teacher maternity leave fund by $4 million and to dedicate $5 million to high-dosage tutoring for reading and math, an initiative inspired by a program Walters established.
Every Oklahoma classroom will be stocked with a Bible, Walters said, even without any state funding to buy them. He said his administration has been collecting donated copies and already purchased more than 500 Bibles with agency funds.
His new state standards for social studies education requires schools to teach biblical stories and the teachings of Jesus that inspired historical figures in American history.
“The Bible is going to be in every classroom this fall,” he said. “The legislature can put the money there or not.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Some health care workers and other Iowans opposed to proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP being discussed by U.S. House Republicans criticized Iowa’s federal delegation as they work on the committees tasked with moving those proposals forward.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks is a member of the House Energy and Commerce committee, the body that voted 30-24 Wednesday along party lines to approve the bill making billions in cuts to federal spending that could include work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid. According to analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the changes in the bill would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next 10 years.
Physicians in the Committee to Protect Health Care urged House members from their districts, including Miller-Meeks, to oppose the House GOP’s budget bill and criticized them for supporting the measure. Dr. Brian Lindsay, an internal medicine physician from Cedar Rapids, said in a statement that Miller-Meeks, who is also a physician, “must be familiar with the tragic stories doctors witness every day when people aren’t able to access or afford health care.”
“As physicians, we challenge politicians like Congresswoman Miller-Meeks to explain how taking away her own constituents’ health care makes their lives better or our community stronger,” Lindsay said in a statement. “When people can’t see a doctor or afford to get the treatment they need, people suffer, some go bankrupt because of huge medical bills and unfortunately, some people die. Every Iowan must stand up and speak out against this reckless Republican plan to take away people’s ability to get medical care so politicians can give huge handouts to billionaires.”
Eric Kusiak, a nurse manager in Iowa’s 1st congressional district, said the cuts could put rural Iowa hospitals at risk of closing in a statement with Fairness for Iowa, a liberal coalition that supports unseating Miller-Meeks and U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, Iowa Republicans in potentially vulnerable seats heading into the 2026 election.
“With these cuts, patients would get sicker, have fewer places to go, and have fewer healthcare workers to care for them,” Kusiak said. “House Republicans and Miller-Meeks voted to take health care from millions of people including seniors, kids, and veterans to pay for more tax giveaways to the wealthy and corporations.”
Miller-Meeks said in a post on social media Wednesday that Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden “made the rules, then broke” Medicaid, and the House GOP plan will “fix” the health coverage program. “Medicaid is for the most vulnerable low-income families, pregnant women, kids, seniors and the disabled — not illegal immigrants or able-bodied men who choose not to work,” Miller-Meeks wrote.
Nunn and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa are on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, that was similarly tasked with finding spending cuts to make to federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Approved 29-25 Wednesday, the bill moved forward by the committee will shift some portions of SNAP funding to states for the first time.
In a video posted on social media Wednesday, Nunn defended his support of the measure, saying voters have “heard a lot of spin about what’s happening with SNAP.” He pointed to the resolution he proposed earlier in May, the “Defending Medicaid and SNAP Resolution,” as a step he has taken to ensure SNAP benefits are not cut for seniors, pregnant women, children and people with disabilities.
“Now, here’s what I’m also going to do: I’m going to make sure these systems are successful now and into the future, fighting getting rid of the fraud, waste and abuse,” Nunn said. “And that means making sure that able-bodied individuals are working at least part-time jobs, and states that have had massive error rates are held accountable so they can correct that for the future.”
He said these changes will provide more money for the program in the future to allow “vulnerable Iowans get the assistance they need” through SNAP in the future.
However, Democrats and others involved in food assistance programs said the cuts will hurt Iowans who rely on SNAP to purchase food for their families. Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, who is running as a Democratic candidate in the 3rd District, said Thursday Nunn was “screwing over farmers and families” with his support for the bill.
“I wanted to rest up a little bit this morning, but I can’t, because I’m so angry,” Konfrst said, referring to the overnight debate leading to the end of the 2025 legislative session at the Iowa Capitol. “Zach Nunn has the opportunity to do the right thing and do what’s best for families, farmers, and veterans back here in Iowa. But instead, he did what he always does, which is fall in line with his party bosses and vote to devastate his own district. “
Feenstra, who also serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, said he supported the bill because it lowers taxes for Iowa families, farmers, workers and businesses “while supporting investments in domestic manufacturing, business growth, Iowa agriculture, and U.S. energy production.”
“I’m also glad that provisions that I led are included like death tax relief, paid family and medical leave for employees of small businesses, affordable crop insurance policies for young and beginning farmers, investments in foreign animal disease prevention, and expansion of our export markets,” Feenstra said in a statement. “Working with President Trump, we are delivering on our promise to the American people to cut taxes, grow our economy, secure our border, and unleash American energy production.”
Feenstra announced he was launching an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial run Tuesday after filing paperwork for a run the day earlier. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said Feenstra’s decision to support the budget bill making cuts to SNAP is a sign that Iowans should not support him to become the state’s next governor.
“Iowans need a governor that works for them,” Hart said in a statement. “While many Iowans are struggling to afford groceries and Iowa is ranked 49th in the nation in economic growth and 48th in personal income, Randy Feenstra voted today to gut SNAP – which is a program that more than 260,000 Iowans rely on and generates economic activity that impacts our farmers, grocers, truck drivers and more. … Randy Feenstra also voted to approve tax cuts for billionaires and the nation’s top 1 percent. Feenstra put requests from greedy billionaires over the needs of Iowans today and showed his priorities are not the same as the Iowa folks he seeks to govern.”
While Iowa’s federal delegation voted in support of these measures, the House budget committee voted 16-21 Friday to reject the spending package that includes the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Alongside Democrats, four Republicans, US. Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, voted against the measure while calling for steeper budget cuts to be included.
Though the measure has stalled, budget negotiations are continuing as House Republicans aim to approve a measure next week before the end of next week, when U.S. representatives are set to leave Washington, D.C. for a week-long recess.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/capitolshutt-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

“We’re losing gallons of water from pipe leaks,” said Charles Hill, city council member in Starbuck.
With an aging population and limited revenue, Starbuck – a town of fewer than 200 people along the Tucannon River in Columbia County – faces mounting infrastructure challenges, particularly in its water and sewer systems. Jody Opheim, executive director of Partners for Rural Washington, a nonprofit that supports rural communities across the state, said the pilot project, called “Rural Opportunity, Advancement, and Resilience,” will help Starbuck and eight other rural towns secure funding and technical assistance for critical improvements.
Palouse, another eastern Washington town, also has been selected to complete a comprehensive upgrade to its wastewater system.
Opheim estimates at least 24 months of completion for most of the projects.
“We’re looking at different ways of financing these projects, beyond the big federal dollars,” Opheim said.
Opheim said they are working alongside the Washington Department of Commerce, Association of Washington Cities, Washington State University Extension and the Washington U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development office to help meet the rural towns’ needs.
She emphasized that while participation doesn’t come with guaranteed funding, each community will receive expert and technical support at no cost.
“Our project managers will herd this process, manage this process, do follow up, make connections, facilitate and then where there isn’t other technical assistance available to look for funding sources,” Opheim said. “This is very much a group effort. It’s a big lift, but we’ve got lots of good core partners and affiliates that we will bring to that community table.”
Staci Nelson, grant services director for the nonprofit, said the group has worked with Starbuck before and identified the water system as a top concern.
She explained the town has two water tanks, one built in 1965 and the other in 1986, which are where their drinking water comes from.
“They need to have the interior of their water tanks re-coated and so we’re going through that process of helping to try and find some resources for them,” Nelson said. “And in addition to the water tanks, they have pipes that need to be replaced due to their leaking.”
Hill said the rural town has lost more than 12 million gallons of water in the last year because of the leaks in the pipes. He expects that number to increase as pipe leaks continue.
He also noted that one of Starbuck’s wells has stopped functioning.
“We do hear from people that there’s pieces of metal, you know, rustic pipe in their water downstream of where some of these leaks are, because the pipes are completely corroded,” Hill said. “I’ve also seen it in some of my water here.”
“It has been an emergency,” he said.
He said that many wheat farmers rely on the town’s water system to care for their livestock, irrigate crops, and water orchards – further stressing the need for immediate action.
“There are a lot of people, a lot of farmers, that use the water in town for their cows,” Hill said.
Nelson said Palouse, a town of about 1,000 residents, is facing similar major water quality upgrades to its wastewater system – a project estimated to cost $23 million.
The cost is largely due to the town’s proximity to the Palouse River, where any water quality issue could lead to contamination, she said. The project has a 2030 completion deadline.
Tim Sievers, mayor of Palouse, said the town needs to meet regulations regarding their wastewater discharge. Palouse’s clean effluent flows into the Palouse River, but the temperature is too high during certain periods of the year, which causes environmental implications for the river ecosystem, he said.
“Secondarily, we have a regulation coming down with our 2030 permit about the levels of dissolved organic nitrogen that is in our effluent. So we’re taking steps to address those concerns from our environmental regulators,” Sievers added.
Critical rural infrastructure upgrades often are overlooked, Nelson said.
“For us to be able to continue to support those smaller communities, it makes the entire part of Eastern Washington, as well as the state of Washington more successful,” Nelson said.
Sievers said the partnership for Palouse will be an important step forward in continuing to grow the rural town.
Hill said they are optimistic and hopeful working with the nonprofit, after years off feeling the town has been “left out” of community development needs.
“Many of us wear multiple hats. One of our farmers volunteers his tractor to cut and dig up the ground to replace a pipe. I’ve been on the council for a little over two years now and I don’t get paid. I mean it’s all volunteer work,” Hill said. “We need help.”

Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Chip Roy of Texas and Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania broke from their GOP colleagues to block the bill from moving toward the floor, demanding changes to several provisions.The breakdown over the 1,116-page bill marks an escalation in the long-running feud between centrist Republicans, who have been cautious about hundreds of billions in spending cuts to safety net programs, and far-right members of the party, who argue the changes are not enough.The committee could return later to take up the bill again, though it was not immediately clear when that might be. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said he wants it on the floor prior to the Memorial Day recess.Speedier work requirementsNorman said he remains a “hard no” until new work requirements for Medicaid recipients phase in more quickly. As the bill is written, the requirements won’t begin until 2029.“To phase this in for four years — We're telling a healthy-bodied, a healthy American that you got four years to get a job. No, your payment stops now,” Norman said.Brecheen criticized the bill for not going far enough to repeal wind and solar energy tax credits, which he contends are “undermining natural gas jobs.”“We have to fix this,” he said.Clyde denounced the measure for not adhering to President Donald Trump’s promise of “right-sizing government,” as Clyde described it. The Georgia Republican also pleaded for lower taxes on firearms and stronger cuts that would put Medicaid on a “sustainable path.”“Unfortunately, the current version falls short of these goals and fails to deliver the transformative change that Americans were promised,” Clyde said.Smucker initially voted ‘yes,’ but then joined his four colleagues to oppose the measure.Trump wrote on his social media platform shortly before the committee voted that “Republicans MUST UNITE behind, ‘THE ONE, BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL!’”“We don’t need ‘GRANDSTANDERS’ in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE! It is time to fix the MESS that Biden and the Democrats gave us. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”‘A wrecking ball to Medicaid’Democrats, who as expected unified in voting no against the bill, slammed it as “ugly,” “cruel” and a “betrayal.”“This bill takes a wrecking ball to Medicaid, on which 1 in 5 Americans and 3 million Ohioans depend for medical care — children, seniors in nursing homes,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, who represents northern Ohio. “Please come with me to visit the nursing homes. … Perhaps too many on the other side of the aisle have not had to endure a life that has major challenges.”Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said the proposed cuts to safety net programs would be “devastating.”“Their changes will kick millions of Americans off their health care and nutrition assistance. That means more untreated illnesses, more hungry children, more preventable deaths,” she said.Republican-only billRepublicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship. Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.Republicans are using the package to extend the 2017 tax law, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.The 11 House committees tasked with drafting pieces of the legislation have all debated and approved their measures along party lines.The Agriculture Committee, Energy and Commerce Committee and Ways and Means Committee all completed their work earlier this week, amid strong objections from Democrats.Proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could shift considerable cost-sharing onto states for the first time, presenting challenges for red-state lawmakers who need to explain the bill back home.More than $600 billion in federal spending cuts to Medicaid during the next decade could also cause some difficulties for moderate Republicans, some of whose constituents are likely to be among the millions of Americans expected to lose their health insurance.Republicans also have yet to reach an agreement on the state and local tax deduction or SALT, a priority for GOP lawmakers from blue states like California, New Jersey and New York.The Budget Committee’s role in the process was to package together all of the bills and then send the one massive bill to the Rules Committee, the last stop before floor debate for major legislation.That won’t be able to happen until after GOP leaders get nearly all the Republican lawmakers on the panel to support the package.",,,,2025-05-16 14:11:00.445357

In a tale of two verdicts, a jury acquitted former House Speaker Glen Casada but convicted his ex-top aide on corruption charges tied to a secretive political vendor.
The 12-person jury found Casada guilty of 17 counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering and Cothren, who left his chief of staff post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal in 2019, guilty on all 19 counts of fraud, stemming from his bogus signature of “Matthew Phoenix” on a federal W-9 tax form and state direct deposit document.
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”

Lawmakers such as Reps. Jay Reedy and Esther Helton-Haynes and former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood testified they wouldn’t have allowed Phoenix Solutions to do their mailers if they had known Cothren was running the company. In late 2019 and early 2020, Cothren was considered a liability because he had been forced to resign, just three months before Casada stepped down from his Speaker’s post after a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
Federal prosecutors displayed several text messages and emails showing Cothren told Smith and Casada to keep his name off of documents. Smith testified that they hatched the plan in a meeting at an upscale Nashville bar in 2019. She came up with the name of “Phoenix” because she felt Cothren and Casada should be able to arise from political ashes.
The company generated $52,000 in revenue from constituent mailers for about 10 lawmakers, money that Smith described as “low-hanging fruit.” They tapped into campaign and Republican Caucus money, as well. But most of the trial dealt with the use of tax dollars.
The trial’s outcome brings to a close a five-year ordeal that started with the FBI probing lawmakers after the 2019 tie vote on the state’s education savings account program for low-income students in Metro Nashville, Memphis and, subsequently, Chattanooga.
Casada and Cothren didn’t testify in their own defense, nor did House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who has been cooperating with federal authorities. The defense raised questions in court documents about whether Sexton or someone in his office wore a wire to record conversations with lawmakers.
The FBI raided the homes of Cothren, Casada and Smith as well as Rep. Todd Warner and other offices on Jan. 8, 2021. A year and a half later, they indicted Casada, Smith and Cothren on a litany of kickback charges.

Olmscheid/ Senate Media Services.Progressives are outraged that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy and House leader Melissa Hortman agreed to a budget deal that will strip health insurance from undocumented adults who became newly eligible for the coverage on Jan. 1 
Here’s Minneapolis City Councilmember Jason Chavez: 
I’m extremely disappointed … They made a deal with the GOP to strip away health care from undocumented residents.
Chavez takes particular aim at Murphy, hinting at a potential primary challenge. “We won’t forget that your re-election is next year.”  
The anger is understandable. At the end of the year, at least 15,000 Minnesotans will be kicked off MinnesotaCare — a public insurance program for the working poor created by then-Republican Gov. Arnie Carlson — if the deal passes. Only undocumented children will still be able to access coverage.
These adults will no longer get routine care, which will worsen chronic conditions or allow undiagnosed conditions to fester. They’ll go to emergency rooms for care. Minnesota hospitals, which favor keeping the program’s eligibility intact, will be forced to provide more uncompensated care. 
The Minneapolis-St. Paul Archdiocese Auxiliary Bishop Kevin Kenney offered some moral clarity on the subject recently: “We need to be able to offer health care to anyone who is here, no matter how they got here, who let them in. Are we going to let them die on the streets? Are we going to let them suffer? Or are we going to allow them — all of us — the basic health care that we need?”
But Chavez’s “extremely disappointed” attack is wildly misplaced. 
Walz, Murphy and Hortman share power with Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth, for whom cutting the MinnesotaCare benefit is a top priority, perhaps her most important priority. 
Walz, Murphy and Hortman had to consider the repercussions of a stalemate that could lead to a government shutdown July 1. Which would be devastating to everyone who relies on state government for services, which is basically all of us — but especially our most vulnerable. 
I suspect most progressives in the Legislature know this, which is why at least so far, we’re not hearing widespread threats to withhold votes to stop the deal, except on the health budget bill that will include the MinnesotaCare provision. Their opposition on that vote will be mostly symbolic, as Murphy should have no problem wrangling some Republican votes. 
(Caveat: It’s a fluid situation, and progressives may wind up risking a shutdown to fight for MinnesotaCare for undocumented people. That’s a difficult choice; let’s hope they make it with eyes wide open.) 
We should also remember what Walz, Murphy and Hortman have managed to protect: paid family and medical leave; earned sick and safe time; and unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, which were three significant achievements of the 2023 Legislature. They’ve also protected schools and social service programs from draconian cuts, despite the state’s structural deficit.  
Instead of the circular firing squad, Democrats might consider who the real culprit here is: Republicans who have made taking subsidized health care away from working people a primary policy goal. 
Why not turn your fire on them? State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson, R-Fergus Falls, is out here bragging in a press release about how he’s “been at the forefront” of taking people’s health care. 
Rep. Elliott Engen, R-White Bear Township, told a a Democratic senator to “cry harder” for caring about people losing their health care. 
If you want to get mad at Democrats, get mad that they lost control of the House last year, which is what allowed taking health care away from working people to rise to the top of the issue agenda. 
Which means getting mad at former President Joe Biden for running for a second term. And getting mad at Kamala Harris for running a lackluster campaign. And getting mad at Minnesota Democrats for running behind Harris in enough districts to lose the House. 
And when it comes to winning the next election, ill-informed attacks on people trying to govern aren’t helpful either.

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on Friday (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers will return to Jefferson City next month for a special session to debate providing tax breaks to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in the state, Gov. Mike Kehoe said in a news conference Friday morning.
The special session could also consider a $500 million spending bill for construction needs around the state, he said, but a final decision has not been made.
In the final days of the regular session, which ended Thursday, Kehoe unveiled a plan to use tax revenue generated by the Chiefs and Royals to finance bonds for their stadiums. The Chiefs would use the money to upgrade Arrowhead Stadium while the Royals would use it for a new stadium in Missouri.
Despite the late reveal, the Missouri House passed the proposal on a 108-40 vote. But the Senate balked at the deal, with many members saying they could not support it because a $513 million capital construction bill died when the Missouri House refused to allow it to come up for a vote.
Kehoe did not see the delay of the stadium proposal as a final defeat.
“We introduced that in the last week of the session to try to find what the feelings were,” he said.
The exact date for the special session has not been determined, Kehoe said.
The Chiefs and the Royals face a deadline at the end of June on whether they will accept an offer from Kansas to pay 70% of the cost of building new stadiums in that state. The proposal floated by Kehoe would pay up to half the cost as well as up to $50 million in tax credits for any direct investments made by the teams.
Remodeling Arrowhead and building a new baseball stadium would cost up to $3 billion, Kehoe said. 
“I would consider that significant economic development,” Kehoe said of the stadiums, comparing them to manufacturing projects that won incentives from lawmakers in the past
Stadium funding, gun rights law among casualties of Missouri Senate breakdown

Missouri House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said she agrees that the state should work to keep the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas but blamed Kehoe for the late introduction of his plan for the need to hold a special session.
“We are at this point because Governor Kehoe committed gross legislative malpractice by springing his stadium plan on lawmakers with no warning and just days left in the regular session without bothering to first build support for it,” Aune said.
The hurdles for a successful special session are both political and financial. The stadium plan died in the regular session when the Senate twice used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and sick leave rights.
The move infuriated Democrats, who vowed the Senate will not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
“I’ve heard a long time, ‘well, nobody has ever made us pay.’” Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat said at a news conference Wednesday. “You’ll find out now.”
Complicating the debate is lingering anger over the projects that were lost when the House sunk the capital improvements bill. The $513 million would have paid for projects at eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
In all, more than 60 projects added by lawmakers, in addition to more than 20 sought by Kehoe, will not be funded.
One of the biggest boosters of the Chiefs and Royals, state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, said she could not support a stadium funding bill if the capital improvements bill is not part of a special session.
“Those things are more important to me and to my colleagues than the Chiefs,” Washington said.
Kehoe did not rule out including the capital spending in a call for a special session, but did not commit to it, either.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “And I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
Kehoe has a June 30 deadline for acting on the $53 billion in spending that was approved for the coming fiscal year. The budget spends $15.8 billion in general revenue, about $2.2 billion more than estimated revenue for the year, by dipping into the accumulated surplus that stood at $3.6 billion when the current fiscal year began.
Revenues are not keeping up with projections and Missouri House leaders cited a need to maintain a fund balance in excess of $1 billion for future years. Kehoe, who will be responsible for making sure spending does not exceed available funds, said he agrees with that approach.
“I don’t think it’s ever appropriate for some politician to think just because we have it, we have to spend it,” Kehoe said. “ It’s more appropriate for us to leave some reserves in the tank for the times when the budget does get tougher.”
Kehoe, who took office in January, had a successful session. Major items he asked for in his State of the State Address — a state takeover of the St. Louis Police Department, school safety legislation and a major tax cut eliminating income taxes on capital gains — all passed.
Kehoe took some defeats as well, with lawmakers spending more than he wanted on public schools, the failure of a bill reducing the top income tax rate and the defeat of legislation allowing parents to enroll their children in school districts other than the one they live in.
He said he looks favorably on the bill repealing the Proposition A sick leave law but stopped short of promising to sign it. 
Kehoe also did not say whether he would put the constitutional amendment imposing a new ban on abortions on a special election ballot or let it wait for a November 2026 vote.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.


Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.


The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-16 16:42:28+00:00,CT Mirror,CT officials poised to exceed budget cap to end Medicaid crisis,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/16/ct-budget-spending-cap-fiscal-guardrails/,Officials plan to legally exceed CT's spending cap to avert a Medicaid crisis and pave the way for a new two-year budget.,"State officials are poised to legally exceed Connecticut’s spending cap for the first time in nearly two decades to avert a crisis in paying Medicaid bills — and to pave the way for a new two-year budget.
Both Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed a tentative understanding to resolve the Medicaid shortfall expected to approach or exceed $300 million this fiscal year.
And while neither discussed exceeding the cap, which keeps overall budget appropriations in line with household income and inflation, officials have largely exhausted other options to circumvent that limit without formally going beyond it.
“The administration continues to make positive progress with legislative leaders on an agreement regarding the deficiency bill for fiscal year 2025 and a framework for the budget for fiscal years 2026 and 2027,” Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Friday. “We are optimistic that an agreement can be reached soon.”
“I expect we will vote on Monday” to cover the Medicaid shortfall, Ritter said late Thursday, then quickly added a huge qualifier that hinted toward a compromise.
Exceeding the cap now allows CT to spend more in next two years
The speaker said legislators will cover that Medicaid gap in the traditional manner, which involves formally appropriating the necessary funds. 
With the administration forecasting an almost $2.4 billion surplus this fiscal year, and another $4.1 billion stashed in the rainy day fund, Connecticut can easily cover a $300 million Medicaid shortfall.
A lack of budget resources was never the problem. 
But covering the Medicaid gap and other cost overruns in the current budget would push spending $25.4 million over the cap, based on the last month’s projections.
That can be accomplished, provided the governor declares a budget emergency in writing and that the House and Senate each agree with a 60% vote of approval. The $300 million would be drawn from this year’s projected surplus. 
And if Lamont and lawmakers agree to spend about $300 million more than normally permitted this fiscal year, they get to spend roughly $650 million extra over the next two years combined, based on spending cap growth rules. Democrats are expected to spend that money on municipal aid, human services, education and state employee wages. 
Officials have done so seven times since the spending cap was created in 1991 but not since 2007, when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But after a severe recession pushed state finances deep into the red and triggered a historic $1.8 billion-plus tax hike in 2011, legally exceeding the cap became politically taboo.
Lamont, who called the spending cap “sacrosanct” in a January meeting with business leaders, has been loath to tamper with this or other budget controls that he often calls “fiscal guardrails.”
Over the last seven years, Connecticut has used budget surpluses to add $3.9 billion to its rainy day fund and shrink pension debt by $8.6 billion.
But many of the governor’s fellow Democrats in the legislature’s majority say these controls, which were last calibrated in 2017, are saving excessively at the expense of local schools, health care and other core services.
These budget caps have captured an average of $1.8 billion from the General Fund each year since 2017, equal to about 8%, and will collect a projected $2.4 billion or 10% this year.
With three-quarters of the General Fund tied to wages, Medicaid, debt service, retirement benefits and other fixed costs, removing 10% from the remaining quarter budget has a big impact.
Critics also say political fears of exceeding the cap have triggered an overreliance on less-than-transparent accounting gimmicks that circumvent spending limits without officially breaking them.
How the various budget plans struggled under the current cap
Since the coronavirus first struck in 2020, Connecticut has used billions of dollars in emergency federal aid — which can be spent outside normal cap limits — to defer cap reform and to bolster programs that otherwise would have been cut. But those resources have nearly all been exhausted, and the impact can be seen in budget proposals for the next two fiscal years.
To keep spending under the cap, budget plans proposed by both Lamont and the Democratic-controlled Appropriations Committee would underfund contractually guaranteed health care for retired state workers by an average of $114 million per year. 
Both also dramatically scaled back a major planned increase in payments to health care providers who treat the poor. 
Budget plans proposed by the governor, the Appropriations Committee and House Republicans each would shift $300 million or more outside of the budget and spending cap system to bolster early childhood development over the coming biennium. The proposal initially came from Lamont, and both parties supported it.
Lamont’s plan would also reduce base education grants to nearly half of Connecticut’s 169 cities and towns next fiscal year.
And the governor would need to borrow $60 million per year to maintain the Town Aid Roads Program, which covers basic road maintenance and winter snow removal, because otherwise his budget would exceed the cap.
Tensions around a proposed workaround
Faced with this year’s Medicaid cost overruns and more cap constraints, House Democrats earlier this week hoped to find one more legal loophole.
They originally planned to shift about $300 million in projected surplus outside of the formal budget — an accounting move possible with a simple majority vote — to meet Connecticut’s obligations to health clinics, social service agencies and other care providers this fiscal year. 
Then, assuming Medicaid demand would not shrink, the Democrats’ plan would restore that extra $300 million to the formal budget in each of the next two fiscal years, effectively claiming a cap exemption on grounds that it was the start of a new program. 
But the Lamont administration balked at what it saw as a transparent and poorly designed gimmick and threatened to delay payments to care providers until after the next fiscal year begins on July 1 on grounds that it didn’t have available funds.
Ritter then countered Thursday by announcing the House would run a bill Monday that would cover the Medicaid shortfall with the off-budget accounting maneuver, effectively forcing Lamont to choose between strict adherence to the spending cap and supporting Connecticut’s care providers.
Both sides quickly thereafter resumed negotiations and struck a compromise, prompted in part by the potential damage to care givers.
Providers responded that — unlike the state of Connecticut — they aren’t flush with cash, can’t wait six to seven weeks for dollars due in late May, and don’t like being used as a political football.
“We will be in serious arrears and not able to make payroll,” Alice Forrester, CEO of Clifford Beers Community Health Partners in New Haven, said shortly before Lamont and legislators struck a tentative deal.
Forrester, whose group employs about 400 people, adding that “things are very tight, and the Medicaid rates are already paying at 62 cents on the dollar. We’re already in the hole.”
Connecticut’s federally qualified health centers, which provider medical, dental and behavioral health care services to about 30% of the Medicaid population, “are already vastly underpaid by Medicaid, which the state’s own study confirmed, and are operating on the slimmest of margins,” said Shawn K. Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.
The prospect of a six-week delay in payments “because of an internal disagreement between policymakers is outrageous and dangerous,” he said, and it could have triggered layoffs, canceled medical appointments and possibly even site closures.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ritterlamont-1024x790.jpg,,,2025-05-16 13:12:27.428326

Kurtis Gregory shakes hands following his introduction to the Missouri Senate (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Farm Bureau will be allowed to sell health care plans to its members, Medicaid will cover the cost of hearing aids for adults and supplies of birth control will be extended under legislation that passed the legislature in the waning hours of the session on Thursday. 
The legislation, which was sponsored by Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory of Marshall, now heads to the governor’s desk.
The underlying bill allows the Missouri Farm Bureau to sell health care plans that don’t abide by the protections set by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, the Farm Bureau would be able to offer lower-price coverage options, which the organization and its supporters say is necessary to help uninsured farmers.
“This is a product that is going to get people coverage that otherwise cannot afford it,” Gregory said at a House hearing last month. “This is a coverage product that is going to save lives. It is a product that’s going to save people money.”
State Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Republican from Sedalia who carried the bill in the House, said Thursday that the Farm Bureau’s health plans “will not be the solution for everyone. But those without health care plans believe this will be beneficial.”
This was the third year the bill has been proposed, and it’s received significant pushback from Democrats and patient advocates, who argue it would leave some Missourians without protections. It’s also faced opposition from insurance companies who argue it gives the Farm Bureau an unfair advantage over competitors.
If the bill is signed into law, Missouri will join 10 states that have adopted similar carveouts for the Farm Bureau in previous years. Alabama and Florida also passed similar measures this year.
Democrats added some protections to the Farm Bureau portion of the bill during negotiations, including mandating the organization to provide a clear disclaimer that the products it’s selling are not officially regulated as health insurance, mandating the company can’t cancel coverage for members because of a medical event and ensuring the state insurance department will handle complaints. 
The bill contains a wide swath of other health measures, including several added by Democrats during negotiations, especially by state Sen. Patty Lewis of Kansas City.
Those include: provisions mandating that Missouri Medicaid cover hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults, expanding access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, requiring insurance companies that provide birth control medication to provide extended supplies and tweaking the law around telehealth to allow audio-only visits. 
There was little opposition voiced on Thursday. 
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Democrat from Springfield, said the negotiations “were able to make a bill significantly better with wins for the majority party, wins for the minority party and ultimately wins for our constituents back home.”
The bill passed by a vote of 147 to 1 on Thursday afternoon in the House. That followed a vote of 24 to 6 in the Senate.
 ‘This is a big deal’

The Farm Bureau would offer lower prices by reverting to the pre-Affordable Care Act practice of what’s called medical underwriting — carefully evaluating applicants’ medical history and risk — to determine whether to cover them and at what price. 
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year. Historically the group has been primarily made up of people in farming communities.
Gregory has estimated around 15,000 Farm Bureau members lack health insurance and would be the target audience to enroll in the benefit plan.
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents say, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Garrett Hawkins, president of Missouri Farm Bureau, said in an interview with The Independent shortly after the bill passed that the organization’s effort has been years in the making. 
Lack of health insurance options for farmers is “an impediment to bringing the kids home to the farm. It’s an impediment to bringing a spouse home to the farm who has pursued off-farm employment solely to get health coverage,” he said. “This is a big deal.”
Emily Kalmer, a lobbyist for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said at a House hearing last month that even with concessions made at the urging of the bill’s critics, patient advocates remain highly concerned.
“To be clear, this legislation still allows the Farm Bureau to sell unregulated products that won’t have to comply with many of the other provisions we fought for over the years,” Kalmer said, including protections for preexisting conditions.
 Hearing aids and birth control

Medicaid coverage for hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults would be expanded under the bill passed Thursday. Currently, Medicaid in Missouri, which is called MO HealthNet, only covers hearing aids for eligible children, pregnant women and blind people.
There was little opposition to that change this year, but in prior years there has been some concern around the cost. The Medicaid hearing aid and cochlear implant provisions are estimated to cost up to $10.3 million in fiscal year 2027, and $2.7 million the following year, according to the fiscal note.
“I realize there are some costs to this,” said state Rep. Cameron Parker, a Republican from Campbell. “But I do believe that the benefit of these services, the hearing instruments, the cochlear implants, outweigh the cost greatly.”
The bill also requires health plans to cover extended supplies of birth control. Plans that provide coverage for hormonal contraceptives would be required to cover a supply lasting up to 90 days, or, for generic medication, up to 180 days — meaning patients would be able to pick up months-long supplies of the birth control pill at one time rather than needing to pick up the prescription more frequently.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly and leaders of the Kansas Legislature approved the $45,000 settlement of a lawsuit filed by a former employee of the Kansas Department for Children and Families who was fired after requesting expansion of medical leave to care for a relative.
Former DCF employee Shayne Watson filed suit in U.S. District Court alleging the state agency interfered with his rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act and was terminated in retaliation for insisting on altering his leave from intermittent to continuous.
Watson had been granted intermittent leave by DCF to care for a relative with dementia from 2019 to 2022, but was fired within two weeks of requesting his FMLA status be changed to continuous.
Court documents show DCF attorney Marc Altenbernt argued the agency didn’t retaliate against Watson and had immunity from the lawsuit. The record also indicated DCF asserted Watson’s work performance was lackluster and that he deviated from a telework agreement. In addition, documents show DCF claimed Watson was combative during a personnel meeting prior to the firing.
Watson was terminated by the state agency in September 2022. He filed a federal lawsuit seeking in excess of $75,000.
In January, U.S. District Court Judge Holly Teeter granted summary judgment to DCF on Watson’s claim the agency interfered with his family-leave rights, but the judge allowed the retaliation claim to move forward. In February, a trial date was set on the retaliation portion of the complaint.
In April, the case was closed following negotiations on a settlement between attorneys representing DCF and Watson.
The State Finance Council, which includes the governor as well as Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, voted 7-0 to resolve the case with the $45,000 payment to Watson.
Watson was hired by DCF in 2018 and worked as a career navigator assigned the help adults without dependent children obtain employment while receiving government benefits.
Meanwhile, the State Finance Council voted to reject a proposed settlement in the case of Link v. State of Kansas. Neither details of the lawsuit nor the settlement amount recommended by the Kansas attorney general’s office were revealed by council members during the public portion of this week’s meeting.
When council members emerged from executive session, the governor requested a motion to accept the settlement. None of the council members present said anything until Senate President Ty Masterson of Andover said the silence reflected opposition to the deal.
“I think you’re finding nobody wants to make the motion,” Masterson said.
“Well,” Kelly said, “we could make the motion and vote it down if that is what everybody is feeling.”
Masterson made the motion to consider the settlement and voted for approval along with House Minority Leader Chris Croft, R-Overland Park.

(Photo by Maine Morning Star)With other states tied up in a federal legal battle, Maine lawmakers are opting to pump the brakes on an effort to hold fossil fuel companies accountable to see how those other cases play out.
The Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee voted Wednesday to carry over one of the two bills that would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other disasters.
Before the committee voted unanimously to ask the presiding officers to carry the bill into the second regular session that begins in January, Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) quoted a constituent of hers, Bob Monks, who recently died. 
Monks was known for his activism around good corporate governance and multiple U.S. Senate runs. Brenner said his idea that “if you ran an elephant company, you would always clean up after your elephants,” captured the spirit of her bill. 
“We need support to clean up after the elephants,” she added. 
However, Brenner agreed that it makes sense to wait until next year so the state has time to track what happens with the pending federal lawsuits before moving forward. Maine Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim made a similar suggestion during the public hearing for LD 1870.
Vermont and New York have already passed similar superfund legislation. However, those states, as well as Hawaii and Michigan, have subsequently been sued for those policies, including by the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department said the lawsuits are also meant to advance an executive order from President Donald Trump that targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions.
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) said his biggest concern with LD 1870 is the ongoing legal backdrop, so he appreciated the time to gather more information before deciding what to do in Maine. 
Since the committee agreed they only need one legislative vehicle to take up this topic again next year, members rejected the other related bill, LD 1808 from Rep. Grayson Lookner (D-Portland). Instead, they sent a letter to the Department of Environmental Protection asking it to report back to the committee with an update on those lawsuits. 
Lookner suggested having the department look into whether Maine would go after the same companies as the other states and collect other data, such as how much it would cost to implement this sort of measure. 
Loyzim told the committee her department was already planning to track the lawsuits as they unfold.

Yellowstone National Park wildlife staff trapped and euthanized a grizzly bear this week after a series of conflicts with human food sources and trash in the park’s most popular tourist areas.
According to a Wednesday press release from the park, the 11-year-old, male grizzly bear, estimated to weigh 400 pounds, had repeatedly sought out food sources near Old Faithful, the Nez Perce Picnic Area and the Midway Geyser Basin parking lot.
The griz developed a strategy to flip over 800-pound dumpsters, uprooted small bear-resistant trash cans from their concrete bases and “became increasingly food-conditioned,” which wildlife managers decided posed a safety risk in such a busy area fo the park. The decisions to euthanize the animal was made to ensure public safety and reduce the chances of other bears becoming habituated to human food.
“It’s unfortunate that this bear began regularly seeking out garbage and was able to defeat the park’s bear-resistant infrastructure,” Yellowstone Bear Management Biologist Kerry Gunther said in a press release. “We go to great lengths to protect bears and prevent them from becoming conditioned to human food. But occasionally, a bear outsmarts us or overcomes our defenses. When that happens, we sometimes have to remove the bear from the population to protect visitors and property.”

The last grizzly bear killed in a management action in Yellowstone was in the fall of 2017, when park officials removed a griz that was damaging tents and accessing human food in backcountry campsites near Heart lake.
Yellowstone National Park’s bear management plan provides bear-resistant food storage lockers in all campgrounds, food storage devices in all backcountry campsites, and bear-resistant garbage cans and lockers. Park officials remind all visitors that utilizing these bear safety measures remain crucial in ensuring public safety, and preventing wildlife from developing dangerous habits.
All of Yellowstone is bear country, from the trails in the park’s backcountry to the boardwalks and parking lots around Old Faithful. Visitor safety cannot be guaranteed, but visitors can play an active role in protecting themselves and the bears people come here to enjoy.
Park staff ask that anyone involved in a conflict with a bear, regardless of how minor, contact park officials or report it to a park ranger as soon as possible. If cell service is available, dial 911. The lives of other people, and the bear, may depend on it.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Yellowstone-National-Park-sign-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

“I am fortunate to have served Iowa State University in many roles over the past 46 years, and it’s been a fascinating journey,” Wintersteen said. “I am truly proud of Iowa State’s extraordinary faculty and staff for their remarkable performance these past years. Perhaps most of all, I will miss the amazing energy, talent and potential of our Iowa State students.”
“Under President Wintersteen’s leadership, Iowa State’s reputation has soared, particularly in research growth, student outcomes and an emphasis on innovation,” Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates said. “With her steady guidance, Iowa State has met and overcome many external challenges, including a derecho, an international pandemic and more.”
During Wintersteen’s tenure, ISU established new and newly renovated facilities across the campus, and the university expanded its ISU Research Park.
Wintersteen is credited with advancing support for research at Iowa State, which now ranks in the top 3% for research out of nearly 500 universities without a human medical school. Over the past eight years, ISU received more than $4.2 billion in external funding, including three consecutive years of record-setting research funding.
According to the university, ISU’s first-year student retention rate has climbed to 87.6%, which is 10.5 points higher than the national average for four-year public institutions, and ISU students are graduating faster than ever before. The average time to degree has decreased from 4.4 years in 2018 to a historic low of 4.12 years in 2024.
Wintersteen is also credited with fundraising success and for helping to secure more than $275 million for new or revitalized facilities, including the Student Innovation Center and the Therkildsen Industrial Engineering Building. The ISU Research Park also experienced significant growth, with a 150-acre expansion and nearly 50 new tenants.
Wintersteen began her career at Iowa State as an extension field specialist in integrated pest management.

Two Florida congressional Democrats have asked federal officials to investigate allegations that the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) and Hope Florida Foundation inappropriately diverted Medicaid funds to two unrelated political committees last year.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the non-profit affiliated with Hope Florida, the charity started by Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis that aims to connect struggling Floridians with local charities and churches.
  Rep. Darren Soto, via his Facebook page
  Congresswoman Kathy Castor via U.S. House
U.S. Reps. Kathy Castor’s and Darren Soto’s letter to Juliet T. Hodgkins, acting inspector general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, marked the first time that federally elected officials have called for a federal investigation into the Hope Florida matter.
“The transfer of Medicaid dollars to a charitable committee and then political committees appears to run afoul of federal laws, including 18 U.S.C. 1347 (to knowingly execute or attempt a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program or obtain money from it) and 18 U.S.C. 371 (for two or more people to agree to defraud the United States), and may implicate other relevant statutes and regulations,” Castor and Soto write.
“As members of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee that provides oversight of Medicaid, we can assure you that Congress is very focused on waste, fraud and abuse of Medicaid dollars. Any unlawful diversion of Medicaid dollars in Florida means that the state is less able to provide services to our neighbors who rely on Medicaid and support the providers who serve them.”
The controversy dominated the second half of the Florida Legislative session this year. It centers around a $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation that came from a Medicaid overpayment settlement with the health care giant Centene last September.
A month later, the foundation sent that $10 million to two nonprofit political committees. Those two committees subsequently sent $8.5 million to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to oppose Amendment 3, the ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana.
The revelations regarding the Hope Florida Foundation were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald. They led to an investigation by the Florida House Health Care Budget Subcommittee that abruptly ended inconclusively three weeks ago. The chairman of that committee, Pensacola Republican Alex Andrade, said that any final charging decisions would be up to the U.S. Department of Justice.
‘Really disheartening’
But there has yet to be a federal response to the controversy.
“Hope Florida had raised only $2 million during its three years of existence but in one fell swoop, received $10 million from a Medicaid settlement which was immediately funneled through other nonprofits to a PAC directed by the Governor’s Chief of Staff,” the lawmakers wrote in a reference to James Uthmeier, subsequently appointed by DeSantis to serve as the state’s attorney general.
The letter adds:
“The Florida House of Representatives initiated an investigation into what State Representative Alex Andrade called a potential ‘conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud’  but ultimately determined that ‘the best avenue is probably a federal investigation because … these were Medicaid dollars.’ The diversion of Medicaid dollars requires immediate investigation.”
During a press conference in Brandon on Wednesday, Casey DeSantis asserted that Hope Florida has become one of the “only meaningful reforms” to the welfare state since President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programs from the late 1960s.
She said it was “really disheartening and very sad, but not surprising, to see these slanderous false accusations hurled at Hope Florida in an attempt to undermine all of the meaningful progress that we’ve had on so many families across the state of Florida.”

“WanderNebraska,” a project of the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation, is promoting visits to 213 museums, libraries and notable attractions this year via brochures, billboards, bus tours and prizes for visiting.
The program, now in its fourth year, has grown from an idea spawned over plates of pasta to an effort that has generated 7,000 requests from 18 states this year for WanderNebraska booklets. Initially, it promoted 27 sites.

“We think it’s a neat program,” said Leslie Fattig, executive director of the Historical Society Foundation. “We’re teaching people about Nebraska history and getting more people involved.”
At Chimney Rock National Historic Site, more than 20,000 visitors have traversed the “Walk to the Rock” trail since it opened in the autumn of 2023, tourism increases that Fattig attributes, in part, to WanderNebraska’s marketing.
Similar to ‘Nebraska Passport’
The WanderNebraska program is similar to the “Nebraska Passport” program operated by the Nebraska Tourism Department, which beckons tourists to visit 70 eateries, breweries, wineries, bed and breakfast inns and other commercial attractions.
Both programs beckon people to discover new places and qualify for prizes. But Fattig said that WanderNebraska is more focused on nonprofit attractions that highlight history, and those in small towns with smaller staffs and budgets.
Tourism advocates have long argued that Nebraska — which ranks as one of the least-visited states — spends too little to promote its sites of interest, so the WanderNebraska program is filling a void.
About 35% of all tourism spending is for historical attractions, she said, so it makes sense to give historical sites a boost.
“A lot of these small museums are really challenged,” Fattig said, adding that many lack the funds or staff to market programs or write tourism grants.
So WanderNebraska promotes sites like the log cabin courthouse in Callaway, the Old Poor Farm Historical Site and Animal Sanctuary in Nickerson and the Furnas Prairie Shelter in Brownville. The program also features several county museums and small-town libraries.
“WanderNebraska invites people to connect with the state’s past in fresh, meaningful ways — whether by visiting a small-town museum, discovering a hidden landmark, or exploring a piece of forgotten heritage,” Fattig said.
Prizes and help for smaller places
By visiting 10 sites, a WanderNebraska participant can get a free koozie. By visiting 25 sites, you get a free T-shirt.
The program, funded by donations and grants, also includes training sessions for small museum operators on how to use social media to increase attendance.
In addition, historian Sara Crook, a professor emeritus from Peru State College, leads a series of bus tours to historic sites across the state, such as a “Wild West” tour that includes a stop at Fort Robinson.
Fattig said that the Historical Society Foundation, which had for decades raised money for the State Historical Society, was confronted with a dilemma in 2019. That’s when the then-director of the agency, Trevor Jones, formed a new fund-raising foundation to replace the 83-year-old foundation. Long-established Historical Society fund-raisers were told that their services were no longer needed.
So, Fattig said, the foundation pivoted, and launched a statewide grant program to help sustain and develop mostly small museums across the state. The grant program has grown from $15,000 in the first year to $83,000 this year.
Promoting sites via Wander Nebraska remains an outgrowth of that effort, she said, though the state Historical Society has since restored the foundation’s role as its official fundraiser.
None of the promotional efforts would be possible without donations from supporters of history, Fattig said. For more information about the foundation and WanderNebraska, access the websites www.nshsf.org or wandernebraska.com.

A million dollars for a cotton picker, $800,000 for a combine and $400,000 for a tractor in recent years drove Graves, who grows cotton, soybeans and corn in Tippah County, to borrow money from Mississippi Land Bank, part of the nationwide Farm Credit System, a co-op that provides financial support for farmers.
But this year, as dim predictions for 2025 have farmers questioning whether a few bad years could tip into a crisis, borrowing money isn’t enough.
Graves said he doesn’t like to rely on federal subsidies, but without the $31 billion in emergency payments Congress approved to aid farmers in December, “wouldn’t any of us survive.”
“I hate that the government has to get in it, but I’m not going to turn down anything they offer, either,” Graves said.
Congress in December approved $31 billion in direct payments to help farmers nationwide cope with lackluster crop prices, high input costs and extreme weather. But some Mississippi farmers said the payments they received through the $10 billion Emergency Commodity Assistance Program were smaller and later than they expected. And it’s unclear when and how the remaining $21 billion in disaster assistance will be disbursed.
Rates the USDA announced in March were much less than initial estimates floated for the per-acre commodity payments – $200 for cotton, $100 for corn, $81 for rice and $50 for soybeans – all linked to an unsuccessful bill introduced by Mississippi Republican U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly in October. Instead, farmers are receiving $85 per acre for cotton, $43 for corn, $77 for rice and $30 for soybeans.
While Kelly’s initial bill calculated payments at 60% of farmers’ losses, the version included in the budget bill lawmakers passed on Dec. 21 – the day a government shutdown would have begun had Congress not acted – figured those payments at 26% of those amounts.
Though the law directed the USDA to make the payments within 90 days of its enactment – by March 21 – some Mississippi farmers said they didn’t receive their money until late April. And unlike the commodity payments, the $21 billion for natural disasters has no deadline for the USDA to disburse it. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, Mississippi has disbursed $118 million through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program. The USDA has not announced when or how the $21 billion will be distributed.
Will Maples, an assistant professor of agricultural economics at Mississippi State University Extension Service, said that while the state is “nowhere near” the conditions that led to the notorious farm failures of the 1980s, “the concern is, can we get there?”
“If we stay in this environment,” Maples said, “2025 is looking tough, and 2026 is another tough year. That’s when talk about ‘Can it get as bad as the 80s?’ will really pick up.” 
Maples encouraged farmers to look out for “price rallies” as the growing season progresses, and not to be afraid to sell early.

Still, some farmers say conditions are worse than they’ve seen in years, and that the timing of federal commodity payments – well into planting season – hasn’t helped.
Brian Camp, a Union County soybean farmer, said farmers had hoped to use that money to pay outstanding debts in time to purchase inputs like seed for this year’s planting season.
“What they sent us now, it won’t even pay our fuel,” Camp said.

Lauren Swann, who grows cotton and watermelons in Union County, said drought last summer in northeastern Mississippi made margins even tighter.
“The math just ain’t mathin’,” Swann said.
As farmers face uncertainty about potential impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs this growing season, some continue to grapple with the consequences of his first trade war, experts said.
On a podcast with Mississippi Today last week, State Economist Corey Miller said that Trump’s 2018 tariffs eroded markets for U.S. agricultural exports and could do so again. The U.S. lost some $20 billion in agricultural exports in Trump’s first term, Miller told WJTV earlier this year.
Maples said that while Brazil first surpassed the U.S. in 2013 to become the world’s largest exporter of soybeans, Trump’s 2018 tariffs – and China’s retaliation in kind – cemented the South American country’s dominance in the international soybean market. China, the world’s top importer of soybeans, which is Mississippi’s biggest crop by acreage, sources some 70% of its supply from Brazil.
For soybean growers, “a lot of what we’re dealing with now is kind of a holdover from the last 2018 trade war we had with China,” Maples said. 
The U.S. and China announced a tariff truce Monday, with both countries slashing tariffs for the next 90 days as they continue to negotiate.
Farmers described struggling to square Trump’s claims to be on farmers’ side with uncertainty about the potential for tariffs to further cut prices. In a March Truth Social Post, Trump urged farmers to “get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product” for domestic sale and “have fun!”
“We’re being told to go out there and have fun, and be patient,” Swann said. “But planting season doesn’t wait, so we can’t wait on help.”
Graves said he hopes Trump’s tariffs will ultimately lead to higher prices, as long as the measures “get everything straight before everybody goes broke on the farm.” 
“He said he’s going to take care of us,” Graves said. “But we’ll see, I guess.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/16074248/Lauren-Swann-6.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Jefferson Griffin has conceded his loss to Allison Riggs in the North Carolina Supreme Court Race.
This ends one of the most pathetic and embarrassing chapters for any public servant in the history of our state and country. 
Seldom before has one man so thoroughly ruined his reputation in the pursuit of power. We can only hope that his humiliation will deter future wannabee autocrats from going down the same dark path that he chose. 
Because you see, there is nothing more patriotic and small-D democratic than gracefully conceding an election that you lost and willfully participating in the peaceful transfer of power. This is how a strong democracy functions. Indeed, there is no democracy when the loser of a race refuses to concede. I was once a proud member of the Republican party before Donald Trump took complete control of the party. Now sadly the GOP has become the party of election denialism, where candidates are praised for trying to steal an election by any means necessary. It is a damn shame, and they are taking the country down a dark path. 
What Jefferson Griffin has done the last few months is also a disgrace to anyone that has ever worn the military uniform and fought for this country and its ideals. I believe that some of the greatest and most inspirational political speeches in American history have been concession speeches. John McCain in 2008 comes to mind. 
But perhaps the best and most American speech of my lifetime was Vice President Al Gore’s concession speech after the 2000 election. This was one of the closest and most hotly contested elections in American history, and after the Supreme Court made its final decision, Gore gracefully conceded to George W. Bush. He didn’t try and change the rules after the game was played, and he certainly didn’t instigate an insurrection at the Capitol, or act like a manchild because he didn’t get his way. 
Instead, he decided to act like a man with honor and a leader with integrity. He put principles over power and country over party and said the following:

        “I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly, neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.”    
 
These are the words of a true patriot. It is hard to fathom such words ever coming from such empty and hollow men as Jefferson Griffin and Donald Trump.
Let us also not forget that Griffin could have followed the lead of what former Chief Justice Cheri Beasley did after her defeat in the 2020 state Supreme Court election. She lost by an even slimmer margin of 401 votes compared to the 734 votes that Jefferson Griffin lost by. She asked for audits and recounts which was in her right after such a close election. But after the recounts confirmed her loss, she conceded like a person of character would and went about her life serving the public in other ways. She left with her dignity and her head held high and history will remember fondly for that.
 Jefferson Griffin had that same opportunity but instead chose the path of raw power. He decided to forfeit his dignity and self-respect and now history will remember him as a coward and a fool, if it even remembers him at all. In a world full of Jefferson Griffins, teach your kids to be an Allison Riggs or a Cheri Beasley. 
All of this leads me to my main point, which is that now that Griffin has finally conceded his election loss, he should also resign his Army commission as an officer in the Army National Guard. 
As an Army veteran myself, the thing that enraged me so much about all of this is that he has worn and still wears the uniform of an Army Officer. He knows better. The fact that he would willingly try to throw out the votes of thousands of military absentee ballots just because they came from “blue” districts is unforgiveable. Men and women who wear that uniform are supposed to represent America’s best. The uniform represents duty, integrity, and moral courage. And what Jefferson Griffin has done these last six months has brought great shame and dishonor to the uniform. The right to vote is sacred and if men that swear an oath to the Constitution are willing to break it in pursuit of political power, then you should give up that precious uniform so someone that actually loves this country and what it stands for can take your place.
Jefferson – if you have even a shred of dignity and decency left, then you will call your commanding officer tomorrow and formally resign your commission. Your unit, your state, and your country deserve so much better than you.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/first-amendment-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Technically, kratom is not a drug, but some people use it like one. In many cases, they’re using it to help them get off of drugs, like highly addictive opioids.
But there are other kratom stories, and they don’t have happy endings. 
There are two bills being debated in the Louisiana Legislature – one seeks to ban kratom entirely, and the other would regulate how it’s packaged and sold, keeping it available for people who say it’s changed their lives for the better. 
In this episode, Illuminator editor Greg LaRose explores both sides of the kratom issue. You’ll hear from the people it affects, good and bad and explore the science behind substance and the disputes over it.
Plus, we’ll chip away at the misinformation that surrounds the political debate – here in Louisiana and in other states that have chosen to regulate, ban and un-ban the substance.

City officials have sued. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic will take their fight to court June 9 to determine whether the company can reopen its prison facility as an ICE detention center without going through a permitting process. 
Attorneys for Leavenworth filed suit in March in U.S. District Court against the Nashville-based company, which ran the Leavenworth Detention Center before it was closed in 2021. 
CoreCivic announced its intent to reopen its prison facility as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, which would be named the Midwest Regional Reception Center. 
In its initial filing, city attorneys said CoreCivic must apply for and receive a supplemental use permit to reopen and operate the prison. 
“Our facility – which has been in Leavenworth since 1992 – is and always has been properly zoned,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin in an email. “Leavenworth’s city code designates our site as an existing special use and lawful conforming use.”
 
Proper permits?
The city recently passed a resolution that indicated CoreCivic needed permission to open its facility, Gustin said. 
“There’s nothing in Leavenworth’s code that allows for such a resolution to rescind zoning,” he said. 
City officials do not agree. In a 211-page filing with attachments, their attorneys said that, while the lawsuit is about the need for proper permitting, there were other problems too. 
From 1992 to 2021, when CoreCivic operated the detention center, the company “became embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the Facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence, and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff,” the filing said. 
“CoreCivic’s mismanagement directly and indirectly impacted the City in countless ways, including for example, by imposing unexpected maintenance costs on its taxpayers, unreasonably increasing the burden on the City’s police and law enforcement agencies to address violent crime, and even impeding the City’s investigation of sexual assaults and other violent crimes against detainees and staff,” the filing said. 
The city’s lawsuit contends that CoreCivic was already operating the prison when the city enacted its development rules that require a permit, so the business was grandfathered in under the new rules. But by ceasing operations for three years, the filing said, CoreCivic must now apply for the special use permit. 
In fact, CoreCivic applied for a special use permit in February 2025 but about three weeks later withdrew that application, the city’s filing said. 
 
Back and forth
Community activists are speaking about against the idea of CoreCivic operating a prison in Leavenworth.

Former CoreCivic employees regularly speak at city and county meetings about their negative experiences working in the closed detention center, and state organizations including the Kansas ACLU have helped organize press conferences and rallies. Objections include how CoreCivic operates, whether people held at the facility will be released into the community, and general opposition to immigrant detention centers.
Gustin said the company, as of April 30, had received applications from more than 1,100 people who want to work at the site. 
“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying, potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth,” said Misty Mackey, warden of the new facility, in a press release. “We’re looking forward to operating a safe, transparent, accountable facility that will be a positive for this community dedicated to public service.”
Gustin said there has been inaccurate reporting about employees working on a job at the prison to replace the facility’s roof. CoreCivic issued cease-and-desist letters to those who accused the roofing company, Bass Roofing and Restoration, Fort Worth, of hiring workers without the proper permits. 
“Any claims that our company has a contractor working for us at our Leavenworth facility that has undocumented or unauthorized workers doing the work are completely false,” he said. “We have been furnished documentation of the legal status of all workers on the roofing project at our facility from the primary contractor and subcontractor.”
The company has said that it will use local contractors at the facility, and Gustin said CoreCivic did reach out to local vendors.
“Experience in roofing our facilities and experience working on our federally contracted facilities is a factor we evaluate in reviewing bids,” he said. “It’s important to note that the roofing contractor who was selected for this project has handled similar work at another of our federal facilities, which required special clearances for workers.”
Collaborative goals
Although aware of community disagreement about the facility, Gustin said CoreCivic wants to work with Leavenworth city and county officials. 
“In addition to the impact fees we’ve agreed to pay – and the property tax we already pay – we’ve worked to both listen to and be transparent with the community,” he said.
CoreCivic has offered the following impact fees:

One-time impact fee of $1,000,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Annual impact fee of $250,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Additional $150,000 annually to the police department

Gustin said no one detained at the facility will be released directly into the Leavenworth community, which is one opposition point. 
“Our facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability from our government partners, including regular audits and onsite monitors,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P1010074-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., are backing a renewed Senate push calling on President Donald Trump’s administration to take urgent diplomatic action to deliver food and emergency aid to civilians trapped in the war-torn enclave.
The two lawmakers joined 27 of their Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution urging the administration to mobilize all available diplomatic tools to break the Israeli blockade that has prevented lifesaving assistance from reaching Palestinian civilians. 
The measure comes amid reports of a worsening humanitarian disaster, with tens of thousands of children at risk of starvation and thousands already suffering from acute malnutrition.
“Every day that innocent civilians, including children, are going without access to food, clean water, or necessary medical care, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens,” Warner said in a statement. 
Warner said it is the responsibility of Israeli authorities to ensure that emergency food and humanitarian aid can reach Palestinian civilians. He added that as lawmakers continue to press for a full ceasefire and the return of all remaining hostages, “the Trump administration must work to ensure that innocent people are not left to die because of inaction.”
Kaine, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, echoed Warner’s urgency and emphasized the need for international aid organizations to be allowed to operate freely in the region.
He stressed that “the Israeli government must immediately lift any blockades on food and emergency aid and allow credible international organizations to facilitate the swift delivery of lifesaving aid to civilians in Gaza.” 
Kaine also emphasized the need to keep pushing for a ceasefire agreement that would bring hostages home and open the door to increased humanitarian assistance, calling it “the only durable path to a resolution of this crisis.”
Since March 2, the Israeli government has blocked all food and emergency aid —  medicine, infant formula, fuel and other essential supplies — from reaching civilians in Gaza. That same month, the United Nations reported the closure of all 25 World Food Program-supported bakeries in the region due to lack of fuel and wheat. 
The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. In response, Israel initiated a large-scale military campaign in Gaza, including air strikes and a ground invasion, with the stated objective of dismantling Hamas and securing the release of hostages. 
Since then, the conflict has resulted in more than 52,000 Palestinian deaths, widespread destruction and the displacement of nearly all of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. The ongoing blockade and military operations have severely exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the region.
Emergency food parcels meant to last two weeks have been depleted, and malnutrition is spreading rapidly among children, with an estimated 10,000 already affected since January. “Once you get to that stage, without treatment, you will die,” warned Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the UN health agency.
Harris added that the number of children receiving care in Gaza’s partially functioning hospitals is lower than anticipated — likely because many are unable to reach medical facilities at all.
WHO data also shows that one in five children is unable to complete treatment, a consequence of ongoing displacement and the unstable, chaotic conditions on the ground.
The Senate resolution does not impose new policy but aims to intensify diplomatic pressure on both the Israeli government and the Trump administration to take immediate steps to allow aid to flow, and to secure a broader ceasefire agreement.

(Photo provided by the New Mexico Health Care Authority)David Scrase has worked as a geriatrician in New Mexico for nearly 30 years, and served several stints as the secretary of the Health and Human Services Departments. He is on the frontlines when it comes to treating older residents and their caregivers.
“This is a growing, giant issue,” Scrase told Source NM. “I always tell people…I never go into a room where at least 80% of the people aren’t trying to figure out what to do with an older person in their family who’s going through something like this. It might not be their immediate family, but…everyone is on the verge of, or in the middle of, or just past having to make these kinds of decisions about how to provide care.”
Scrase started his practice in Michigan in 1981, relocated in 1998 to New Mexico and, he says, started concentrating on patients 75 and older in 2015. He also works as a clinical professor with the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.
Source NM spoke with Scrase recently about his concerns over aging health care and caregiving. The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: What concerns do you have about the state of care for seniors in New Mexico?
David Scrase: New Mexico in the year 2000, we were ranked number 39th in the country in terms of the percent of people we had in our population that were 65 and older. And in 2030, according to some really reliable projections, we’ll rank fourth. 
NM Aging department commits to helping seniors age ‘in place’ and ‘autonomously’ in new draft plan

Seniors, in general, use about three times as many resources as people under 65, and so you’ve got this more than doubling of the senior population combined with three times the use rate. So there’s going to be a dramatic growth of seniors and need for care for seniors. 
There’s also the fact that we have the number one poverty rate among people 65 and older, so we have the highest poverty rate for seniors.  And poverty creates illness and complexity.
In the United States, over 6 million people are living with Alzheimer’s disease.  That’s projected to more than double in the next 15 to 20 years. And over 11 million people are caregiving for dementia patients and they’re providing 15 billion hours of free care. And in addition to having to really grow our healthcare facilities to manage all the growth in the population and their use of resources, we’re going to have an issue with caregivers.
What are you seeing in your own practice?
Typically, we see people with dementia either coming in with their spouse, who probably is about the same age as them, and they’re in their 80s and they’re getting progressively less able to perform normal activities or daily living. So the natural history of Alzheimer’s disease is a gradual decline and, therefore, how much caregiving they need is a gradual increase. As we have more Alzheimer’s disease patients and they have this decline, more burden is placed on the families.  And so it’s extremely rare for me to see someone in their 80s not get completely worn out if they’re the sole caregiver for a spouse or partner. 
The most common group of people outside the home that become caregivers are, of course, daughters, which is about 50%, and then followed by daughters-in-law, which is estimated to be 40 to 45%, and so then the men get involved, unfortunately in the last 5 to 10%. And these caregivers, they’re quitting their jobs. If they’re from a big family, they set up some sort of elaborate rotation, but it’s really, really hard to provide care at home for people who may be at the nursing home-level of care needed.  
That is an economic consequence to their family, to the country, et cetera, et cetera, because Medicare doesn’t pay a daughter to take care of her dad. They don’t provide any help when Dad moves in with the family. 
As a geriatrician, I’ll have residents rotate with me, and I’ll always say at the beginning of the session, because half of my patients maybe have dementia, I’ll say, ‘I want you to pay attention to, one, how advanced this patient’s dementia is and, two, how much time do I spend talking to the patient versus how much time I spend talking to the caregiver.’ And as people’s dementia advances, I spend a lot more time making sure the caregiver’s OK, that they have strategies to take care of themselves, that they can cope, because Alzheimer’s disease, we don’t have a lot of great treatments that really improve it.  And if the caregiver collapses, then the whole system collapses. And so typically, the worse the dementia, the more time I spend with the caregivers. 
What concerns have you heard from other New Mexico practitioners?
People are living longer and older people are becoming increasingly complex. I’ve seen a huge change from 1990.  And so it’s harder for some primary care doctors to manage the growing complexity of an 80-year-old’s medical problems. If someone raises the question and someone has a memory issue, that’s like a half hour of time that you have to figure out how to squeeze into a 20- or 30-minute appointment. And often it doesn’t come up until halfway through and so doctors are scheduling people to come back for those assessments. But we’re going to see more and more of it. 
What advice do you give to family caregivers?
The number one thing is you need to take care of yourself first. And it’s like you have this bucket of what you can scoop out every day of help to give to your loved one.  And if your bucket’s not full, it’s not a long-term strategy. That’s probably the biggest issue is getting people to accept the fact that to be an effective caregiver, the first thing they need to do is take care of themselves.
We have these things called the Six Activities of Daily Living: bathing, dressing, feeding, moving around, transferring, continence and going to the bathroom, and when people need help with two of those six, they qualify at the basic level for nursing home care, and there’s families who’re trying to provide three, four, five, sometimes six things at home.  And so if it’s clear that the family members are just not able to survive this, then I’ll recommend that they improve the quality of time they spend with their loved one by putting them in a place where trained professionals can provide all this day-to-day medical care and support care and they can go and have quality time with their relative. 
And then there’s a middle one where they’re not as bad as they need to be in a nursing home, but it’s clear that we’re on this downhill course. And I’ll say, ‘you need to have a plan B. I suggest you go out and look at some assisted living places or some graduated level of care places where you could be in assisted living and then go to a memory care unit maybe and then a nursing home.’
Most people focus on the question of whether or not they want to go to a nursing home, yes or no. And I don’t think that—particularly as people get sicker and sicker— is a helpful question to ask. I think the question is, ‘Do I want to go to a nursing home and accept the pros and cons of that choice, or do I want to keep mom at home and accept the pros and cons of that choice?’ Because there are consequences whichever decision, and that’s why I think I try to work with families to say, ‘hey, this isn’t something you need to decide to feel guilty about. You could really focus on the quality of the time you’re spending with your loved one.’

(Photo courtesy of USDA)A study by the University of Southern California estimates hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic metals have been dumped onto forests during aerial fire retardant drops during the past decade potentially causing harm to wildlife, specifically endangered and threatened species, according to new federal lawsuit filed against the U.S. Forest Service.
The bright red fire retardant, often seen on television being dumped from large air tankers, contains cadmium, selenium, chromium, and other metals, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics on May 7. The organization is a non-profit made up of current and former USFS employees dedicated to protecting the country’s forests and reform within the agency.
“This stuff is astonishingly dirty,” said Andy Stahl, the executive director of the organization. “Why the hell are we using such a dirty retardant?”

The chemicals found in some retardants can also be fatal to aquatic life and high concentrations of the metals can be toxic to humans, too. The lawsuit focuses on protections for wildlife, alleging the federal agencies are violating the Endangered Species Act.
“At the risk of doing the regulatory agencies job for them, Plaintiff points out the obvious – toxic metals in aerial retardant are bad for many Threatened and Endangered species,” the lawsuit reads.
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are also defendants in the lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs are seek acknowledgement and disclosure of the toxic metals being used, as well as biological opinions from other agencies assessing the impact of the fire retardant on threatened and endangered animals.
The USC Study, which is referenced in the lawsuit, was published in 2024 after researchers bought fire retardant and put it in a mass spectrophotometer to determine the chemical make-up of the retardant.
“Based on information and belief, the Forest Service has known about the presence of some, or all, of these metals in aerial fire retardant since well before the publication of the USC study,” the lawsuit reads.
The study estimated that between 2009 and 2021, about 840,000 pounds of toxic metals were added into the environment due to fire retardant drops in the United States.
Companies only had to disclose part of their retardant formula, according to the study, necessitating the mass spectrometry test. Previous concerns around retardants mostly centered on it containing ammonium polyphosphates, which can kill wildlife.
“They’re the ones who have really blown open this issue that retardant, the Phos-Chek retardant, contains astonishingly high levels of heavy metals like cadmium,” Stahl said. “We’ve suspected that for years.”
 ‘Most expensive, least effective’

The organization filed the suit in Missoula in part due to its long association with wildland firefighting.
The United States Department of Agriculture has a Technology and Development Center in Missoula, which includes a lab where fire retardants are tested and certified. Missoula has been at the center of aerial firefighting since the 1940s.
“Missoula tends to be a focal point with fire retardant,” said Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire research scientist with decades of fire experience.
He also worked at the Missoula Technology and Development Center and doesn’t think fire retardant’s work.
“It’s just about the most expensive, least effective mechanism of fire suppression,” Cohen said.
Drops can be impacted by winds, which can also ground aircraft in the first place. Embers can also move over retardant lines and in a famous example, jumped over a six-lane interstate near Santa Rosa during a 2017 fire.
Direct attack on a fire, or when firefighters’ objective is to contain the blaze as quickly as possible, is also a combination of people, machines and tools. rarely, if ever, is only one method used to work a wildfire.

Cohen said multiple studies into whether retardant drops have any impact on the perimeter of fires have shown inconclusive results as to whether or not they work.
The assumption that retardant drops are effective is a dangerous notion, especially in legal arguments, Cohen said. In a previous lawsuit filed by the ethics group, a Missoula judge ruled that fire retardant does pollute water, but allowed agencies to continue the practice.
“The judge admitted that that was happening and essentially decided against withholding the use of the retardant based on the statement, something on the order of it is conceivable that greater harm to the environment, people and their property would occur without using fire retardant and that assumes that fire retardant is effective” Cohen said. “And to me, that’s very troubling.”
For Stahl, the drops are often about optics and he went on to say the vast majority of aerial retardant drops are ineffective. They are also only used on about 5% of fires, he added.
“Some of the Missoula Fire Science researchers have said to me, quietly, we would accomplish the same damn thing if we just put red food coloring into water and dumped it out of airplanes,” Stahl said. “It would look good on CNN. It wouldn’t be bad for the environment, and it would be just as effective in fire suppression.”
 ‘The cowboy coming over the ridge’

Fighting fires is expected to get more expensive across the country as the climate turns drier and hotter.
Forestry practices in the United States have also focused on suppression, necessitating the armies of firefighters and equipment fire agencies utilize each year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the five-year average for suppression efforts in the U.S. is about $3 billion annually.
Prescribed fires, or fires set with the purpose of clearing out fuels or other land management goals, are sometimes used as a tool by fire agencies.
Decades of suppression have left many forests overgrown and full of dead wood, generally regarded in the firefighting world as “fuel” that can make fires more intense.
Prescribed burns seek to take some of that intensity out of wildfires by removing fuels ahead of time.
But there’s a problem there too, Cohen said — the scale of prescribed burns is not nearly enough.
“Prescribed burning is pointless the way we’re doing it now,” Cohen said.

Stahl brought up the example of recent wildfires in Minnesota. Prior to European colonization, the area was an oak savannah that did not have dense forest.
“We’ve committed all the great plains to croplands and have suppressed fire, we now have forests and these in Minnesota and similar northern tier states that used to be savanna, oak grasslands, and those forests when the humidity is low and the wind is high, which, by the way, means the airplanes that dump either water or retardant can’t fly. We get these fires, and they got lots to burn, a lot of biomass to burn.”
To address the issue, Cohen said the focus should be on building and planning. He views community wildfire risk as a structure ignition problem – the way we build makes structures too easily burned. He said if more fire resistant buildings are constructed with fire resistance in mind, fire crews can have a better plan to fight fires and fewer structures will be lost.
No community can fully be fireproofed, Cohen said, but that doesn’t mean it hurts to try. The more buildings that are protected, the less limited fire resources are stretched.
“We can reduce the number of ignitions that do occur and can be matched by our fire protection,” Cohen said.
Communities across the country are updating their fire readiness and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy has made a point of introducing legislation on the topic, including some for aerial response to fires.
The problem for some, though, is whether aerial bombardment is the most effective strategy for fighting wildfires. And whether the cost, both financially and on the environment, is worth it.
“We do it because it looks good on CNN. It’s the cowboy coming over the ridge,” Stahl said. “Everybody’s real excited. And they see the retardant bomber arrive and the red stuff come out of the plane. They think, ‘Oh, my God, we’re saved.’ Yeah, not so much.”

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A southern Iowa school teacher who lost her job after giving a female student a condom for the girl’s protection has been denied unemployment benefits.
According to state records, Cheyenne Wilson was hired as a high school science teacher by the Clarke Community School District in August 2024. According to testimony given at a state hearing in March, four girls were in Wilson’s classroom on Nov. 14, 2024, for an after-school study session. The students were seated approximately 4 feet away from Wilson while discussing a text conversation one of the students was having with a boy.
One of the students asked Wilson is she knew the definition of an acronym used to describe a particular sex act, and Wilson responded that she did, after which the student stated her own definition of the term.
The conversation then shifted to another sex act, with one student indicating she was nervous about performing the act and using her teeth. Wilson allegedly responded, “Don’t use your teeth, then.”
When it became clear to Wilson that the student was planning to have sex with a boy, she gave the student a condom from her desk for the girl’s protection. Four days later, a complaint was filed with the school district and the principal, Joe Blazevich, began an investigation, with Wilson placed on administrative leave.
The district later sent a letter to Wilson, saying her behavior had called into question her fitness for duty and her ability to serve as an effective role model for students and employees of the district. The letter went on to state that Wilson was not to speak to students and staff or be on school district premises or attend any district activities during the investigation.
On Nov. 20, 2024, Blazevich and Superintendent Kurt DeVore held a meeting with Wilson, during which she allegedly confirmed what had transpired during the Nov. 14 incident.  DeVore told Wilson she had the option to resign and that if she refused there would be an additional “district level” investigation of her conduct. Wilson opted to resign.
Wilson was initially awarded unemployment benefits after a fact-finding interview, but the school district appealed that decision, leading to a March 28 hearing before Administrative Law Judge Emily Drenkow Carr.
At the hearing, Blazevich testified that Wilson should have redirected the students’ conversation to a more appropriate subject matter and noted that Wilson was not a sex educator and was not tasked with addressing such issues with students.
In finding that Wilson was not entitled to unemployment benefits, Carr stated the evidence indicated Wilson’s resignation was not forced and that she was given the option of remaining employed while undergoing a district-level investigation that might involve the school board.
“While Ms. Wilson’s decision to resign may have been for good personal reasons, it was not with good cause attributable to the employer,” Carr ruled.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-05-16 12:23:47.174908

The measure doesn’t represent a significant cost savings for consumers. It would only shave about 38 cents off a $9 box of tampons.
But advocates raising awareness about the financial burden some people face with every menstrual cycle — and the resulting health consequences — argue that doing away with the state “tampon tax” does have symbolic importance.
“It’s not going to cost (the state) that much,” said Emily Swanigan, a spokeswoman for Period, an education and advocacy group, “but it’s going to demonstrate that women’s health is a priority.”
Missouri Republicans included the tax break on period supplies, along with diapers and incontinence products, in a bill passed May 7 that also eliminates the state’s capital gains tax. In a statement, Republican House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit called the bill “family first legislation.” Gov. Mike Kehoe is expected to sign it.
“Cutting taxes on diapers and feminine hygiene products affects ALL Missouri families,” the statement said, “and will have the greatest positive impact with low-income women and girls across Missouri.”
Democrats, too, have supported cutting taxes on necessities like period products and diapers. They did not support this bill because of the capital gains tax provision, which they argued will largely benefit wealthy Missourians and leave the state in fiscal peril.
But getting rid of the tax on period products and diapers is the right thing to do, said Rep. Jo Doll, a St. Louis County Democrat, who for five years has introduced legislation to remove the tax on menstrual products and diapers.
“The concept that we’re taxing basic necessities as luxury items just seems absurd,” she said.
“I’m sure if you talk to anyone who uses diapers or period products, they can tell you they are not a luxury.”
 Growing awareness

Missouri is one of 20 states that still charge sales tax on period products.
Period, Swanigan’s organization, estimates that Kansas collects just over $3 million annually on taxes assessed on period product sales, while Missouri brings in close to $8 million, a sliver of the state’s $53 billion budget.
Kansas lawmakers have also considered legislation to do away with that state’s tax on period products, but so far that effort has failed.
Still, advocates said, the fact that red states like Missouri and Kansas are considering the issue at all is evidence of growing awareness about “period poverty,” the lack of access to affordable menstrual products. Alabama also recently passed a bill to eliminate its state tampon tax.
Experts said the COVID pandemic may have helped fuel awareness. Supply chain issues and lack of access to products at schools and other public places during the pandemic made the problem even more pronounced and harder to ignore.
Awareness helps in finding a solution to a problem that in past generations was rarely discussed, especially in public, Swanigan said. People are starting to see period products as an essential need, like medicine or food, she said.
“Even within the last two to five years, we’ve seen an increase in understanding about this issue,” Swanigan said. “That’s good news for future policy changes that could help more people.”
In addition to calling for an end to all sales taxes on these products — counties and cities tax them, too — Period wants to see government programs like Medicaid cover them. Food assistance programs like SNAP and WIC do not.
 Consequences

A 2023 survey commissioned by Period and Thinx Inc. found that a quarter of teens and one-third of adults struggled to pay for period products, which have been soaring in price. According to reporting by the Wall Street Journal, the price of tampons went up 36% between 2019 and 2024, while the cost of sanitary pads rose 41%.
It’s a major financial strain for many families, said Jeanette Higgins, a nurse practitioner at Children’s Mercy Hospital.
“Especially for low socioeconomic households,” Higgins said, “they may be forced to choose between buying a menstrual product or buying food.”
The rising cost of menstrual products may be part of the reason Giving the Basics, a Kansas City-area nonprofit that provides pads, tampons and other hygiene supplies to shelters, food pantries and schools, has seen a sharp jump in demand for them.
In 2024, the organization distributed 750,000 period products around Kansas, Missouri and 18 other states. That was a 56% jump from the previous year, said Ashley Allison, the organization’s marketing coordinator.
“It’s one of our most requested products for sure,” she said. “It’s a huge need.”
Other Kansas City organizations, including Giving Hope & Help Inc.  and Strawberry Week, also work on raising awareness and making supplies available to people in need.
When people can’t afford proper supplies to manage their periods they often miss work, which has economic consequences. Kids also miss school and school-related activities. That not only can cause them to fall behind in their classes, it can lead to depression and anxiety, Higgins said.
“Fearing that when they have their period, are they going to have a product?” Higgins said. “Are they going to have to miss an activity or have to miss school?”
Giving the Basics donates period products to 1,028 schools in Missouri and Kansas, including the Independence School District. Lori Halsey, that district’s director of health services, said she wants every student to know they are welcome to take as much as they need for themselves and their family. In addition to donations from Giving the Basics, Halsey said the district relies on grants and funding from the state education department to meet the need.
“It is a struggle for girls to not have that resource,” Halsey said.
There are also health consequences. The 2023 survey from Period found that 40% of teens and more than half of adults have worn period products longer than recommended.
Higgins said using a pad or tampon too long can lead to infections or serious illness. Improvising with supplies not intended for that use can also cause infections, she said.
 Ending stigma

While more schools provide free products to students, asking for them can be intimidating, especially for teens. Stigma is another major hurdle in the fight to end period poverty.
“Girls, especially young girls, have a lot of trouble just even talking about periods,” Higgins said. “Having to go to the nurse to discuss their period cannot be comfortable to begin with, and then they have to discuss why they don’t have products available to them.”
That’s why period products should be free and widely available, said Jessica McClellan, founder and president of Giving Hope & Help, a Kansas City organization that donates pads, tampons and other care items to people in need.
Just as people can find free toilet paper in virtually any public restrooms, she said, people should also find free menstrual supplies. And the world should stop being afraid to talk about periods.
“There’s power in the period,” McClellan said, as she walked around her organization’s Midtown storage room, stocked floor to ceiling with pads, tampons and other hygiene products destined for schools, domestic violence shelters and, sometimes, communities on the other side of the world.
“This is not a woman’s health problem,” she said. “This is a world health care problem that we can easily solve. And it’s a world health care problem that’s right here in Kansas City.”

(Ciattarelli photo by Amanda Burns/Spadea photo by Hal Brown)Bill Spadea, the Republican former radio host running to become New Jersey’s next governor, said learning that he would not be getting President Donald Trump’s endorsement was like a punch to the gut.
Spadea was walking into a campaign event Monday night when he received a phone call from Bill Stepien, who ran Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, telling him Trump would be endorsing Spadea’s chief rival in the GOP primary, Jack Ciattarelli.
Spadea said he hadn’t seen that coming. But, he said, by the next morning, he woke up to hundreds of texts of support, dozens of new volunteers signed up, and a flood of new, low-dollar donations.
“It exposed this incredible groundswell, thousands of people reaching out. I don’t know that I would have heard from all those people if they didn’t feel the need to say, ‘Wait a minute. This is ridiculous — you’re the Trump guy.’ So I’m very pleased about that,” Spadea said Thursday following a lunch event with the Women’s Republican Club Mantoloking-Bay Head.
Spadea and Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman who has twice before sought the governor’s seat, have spent months dueling for the support of Trump and the president’s supporters. Trump on Monday posted his endorsement of Ciattarelli on social media, calling Ciattarelli “a terrific America First candidate.” Ciattarelli called himself “truly humbled and honored” to receive Trump’s endorsement.
Speaking to voters at Charlie’s of Bay Head Thursday, Spadea compared Trump’s endorsement of Ciattarelli to a priest at a funeral giving remarks for someone they didn’t know. He said Trump endorsed “a poll, not a person.”
Several polls have shown for much of the race that Ciattarelli is the clear front-runner in the five-man GOP primary. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill poll released Thursday puts Ciattarelli at 44% and Spadea in second place at 18%. The poll says 23% of respondents were undecided.
“The guys around the president want it easy. They’re like, ‘Oh, Mr. President, look at this, he’s 20 points down. He can’t win,’” Spadea said. “Really? Because I remember 2016, when Hillary Clinton had a 98% chance of becoming the president.”

Asked to comment, Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell called Spadea’s remarks “just more BS.”
“The fact of the matter is that Spadea is losing this race by a landslide because of his harsh attacks on President Trump and his lying smears against Jack Ciattarelli. If Spadea thinks it’s a good idea to double down on that failed strategy, more power to him. Jack is focused on uniting the party and working with President Trump to fix our state,” Russell said.
Ciattarelli was the Republican nominee for governor in 2021, losing to Gov. Phil Murphy in a close race.
Less than four weeks remain until June 10, when voters will decide who wins the Democratic and Republican nominations for governor in the fall. Murphy, a Democrat, will leave office in January and is barred from seeking a third consecutive term. In addition to the five-man GOP race to succeed him, six Democrats are vying for their party’s nomination.
While Spadea said Thursday he’s disappointed he wasn’t endorsed by Trump, he believes it’ll hurt Ciattarelli in the long run. He cited candidates with Trump’s endorsement who lost their elections, including Christine Serrano Glassner in last year’s U.S. Senate primary in New Jersey.
Candidates need to have a “certain character, strength, principles in order to capitalize on making that endorsement something,” Spadea said.
“Our plan aligns with his plan, so it would have been a real match,” he said. “So, it would’ve helped me. It’s not going to help Jack the way he thinks.”

While the state of Connecticut suggests “that homeschooling parents complete the Intent to Homeschool form for each child annually and submit it to the Superintendent’s office for signature”, the form is not mandatory. 
In the past three school years, the rate of children exiting the public school system to homeschooling has been less than 0.5% annually of all students in Connecticut public schools, according to a recent report by the Connecticut Department of Education. About 22% of these had been identified for special education prior to their exit, according to the report. 
The rate of children transferring to homeschooling has had a small decline, from 0.4% in the 2021-2022 school year to 0.3% in school years 2022-2023 and 2023-2024. According to the 2025 report, 1,857 children were homeschooled across the state of Connecticut in the 2023-2024 school year.
The numbers of children who transferred to homeschooling do not include children who were never enrolled in public schools.
The optional “Intent to Homeschool” form is sent to school districts. Some parents notify their district that they are continuing homeschooling from the previous year, or that they have children who were never enrolled in school in the first place. For example, the Connecticut Department of Education reported that in Bridgeport, 56 children exited from public schools in the 2023-2024 school year. Bridgeport Public Schools told the CT Mirror they knew of 90 children who were homeschooled that year, which includes children whose parents submitted the Intent to Homeschool form.
The CT mirror contacted 10 of the state’s biggest school districts as well as some in the Greater Hartford area. Of the districts that provided five years’ worth of data, three reported slight decreases in the number of homeschooled children in 2024-2025 compared to 2020-2021, while two reported that homeschooling remained steady. Their data include children who may have unenrolled and reenrolled.
School districts do not have a way of accounting for children who were never in the system. 
“There may be more students who live in the Norwalk community who are homeschooled, but we cannot track them unless they entered our district at some point,” according to an email from Norwalk Public Schools. 
According to the 2024 Household Pulse Survey data, a U.S. Census survey conducted across nine two-week cycles in 2024, the actual number of homeschoolers may be higher. The survey estimated that 3% of Connecticut adults living with K-12 children who reported their school enrollment type are homeschooling. There were also many adults surveyed who did not report their children’s enrollment type.
According to the Household Pulse Survey’s 2023-2024 data, 6% of children nationally are homeschooled. Connecticut is one of 30 states that does not collect or report homeschool participation data.
According to the CT Homeschool Network, “CHN has grown over the decades to around 25,000 CT families,” but this number also includes families who are not currently homeschooling their children.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)With roughly a month left of the legislative session, some big ticket bills are starting to be set aside until next year. Requests for bills that committees hope to carry over to the 2026 session are supposed to be due to the presiding officers on Friday.
Meanwhile, the Maine Senate and House of Representatives have been busy with marathon voting sessions.
To start, lawmakers this week backed a bill (LD 702) that would officially designate Jan. 6 as a Day to Remember, which if the governor allows the bill to become law will require an annual proclamation “honoring the resilience of democracy during the events of January 6, 2021 in Washington, D.C.,” and encouraging education and civic organizations to observe the day with discussions and events. Before passing the House 74-65, the legislation prompted passionate debate over whether the designation is an important record of the U.S. Capitol riot or if it would be divisive. The Senate voted 20-14 in support.
Other votes of note: 
Following the House vote last week, senators voted 20-12 to reject a bill (LD 187) that would prohibit public sector labor unions from imposing mandatory service fees on nonmembers, otherwise known as a “right to work bill.” 
A labor bill that did pass the Legislature this week is LD 54, which requires employers to disclose pay ranges and maintain records of employees’ pay histories.
Both chambers backed legislation (LD 407) directing the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, which operates the former Brunswick Naval Air Station, to take steps to purge the property of firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, by Dec. 31, 2026. (More on that here and here).
Following passage in the House, the Senate voted 17-15 to back legislation (LD 328), “An Act Requiring the State to Pay a Retired State Employee’s or Retired Teacher’s Premium for Medicare Part B Under Medicare Advantage.” Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), who co-chairs the Labor Committee, said the measure is in part a response to the cut and capping of cost-of-living adjustments for retired teachers and other state employees.
Legislation (LD 792) to provide one-time funding to support a research project to evaluate the impact of access for cancer patients to specific dietary services died in what is called non-concurrence after both chambers could not agree on whether to pass or reject the bill (the House was against, Senate for). 
The Senate voted 20-13 and the House 75-64 to back a bill (LD 700) that requires the University of Maine System to waive tuition and fees for eligible full-time students to make up the difference between costs and federal Pell Grants and other financial aid.
Legislation (LD 14) to provide any member of a federally recognized Indian nation, tribe or band in Maine is not required to pay a fee for admission to any state-owned park, historic site, camping area or beach managed by the State passed the Senate unanimously before passing the House 121-18.
Rebuffing the majority of the financial services committee’s opposition, the Senate voted 21-13 and the House 73-69 in favor of an amended version of LD 163, which requires insurance coverage for federally approved nonprescription oral contraceptives and nonprescription emergency contraceptives.
The House and Senate unanimously backed a resolve (LD 270) to establish legislative review of proposed changes to Chapter 850: Health Plan Accountability, a major substantive rule of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, Bureau of Insurance. During the House discussion, Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) pointed to a portion of the rule that would ensure the name and title of an individual reviewing health insurance claims would not be disclosed publicly, which she said was brought forth after the murder of the UnitedHealth CEO.
Both chambers supported legislation (LD 281) to provide ongoing funds to the Maine Discovery Museum to support the Maine Science Festival, the Maine Invention Convention and the Science Around ME program. 
The chambers are at odds over legislation (LD 828) that would allow chiropractors to be designated as school health advisors. After being rejected by the House by a 77-63 vote, senators accepted an amended version of the bill that specifies that chiropractors can provide physical examinations of students.
The House and Senate are also split over a bill (LD 1013) that would require voter approval if a municipality is seeking to issue a $10 million or more bond. The Senate voted 18-16 in favor of the bill while the House rejected the measure by a vote of 74-68.
And the chambers are at odds over LD 421, “An Act to Eliminate Barriers to Reentry into the Community After Incarceration by Repealing Certain Driver’s License Suspension Provisions.” After the House killed the bill under the hammer, Sen. Pinney Beebe-Center (D-Knox) asked the Senate to take up the minority report in support of the bill, which it backed 19-15. Supporters said the provision would help formerly incarcerated people rejoin society in productive ways, which would be less likely to lead to recidivism. 
The chambers both rejected bills that would prohibit geoengineering (LD 825); direct the Public Utilities Commission to take steps to reduce the use of natural gas through energy contracts (LD 1251); and a bill that would require municipal approval before the state places noncitizens in a municipality (LD 422), among others.
The House and Senate also voted against labor bills that would roll back several child labor protections regarding the number of hours 16- and 17-year-olds can work (LD 644) and extend the hours minors under 16 years old can work (LD 618). More on those here.
Both chambers also rejected a bill (LD 918) that would allow a qualifying religious organization to self-insure for automobile insurance. Sponsor Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said the bill is meant to help Maine’s Mennonite community, explaining that they don’t believe in relying on others, which he said extends to insurance coverage. However, critics said it would leave those on the other side of an automobile accident with fewer protections.
Some of the other bills that passed both chambers under the hammer:

Senate action
Following similar action in the House last week, the Senate voted 21-12 to advance an emergency measure (LD 1948) that would make the funding in the two-year budget for MaineCare available more immediately (more on that here). The body first voted 21-12 to suspend the rules to bypass the committee process. For an emergency provision to pass, it will ultimately require support of two-thirds of both chambers, which is unlikely given Republican opposition. During debate, Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Lewiston) said MaineCare providers across the state “are in crisis because of delayed promised payments…The tragic part of this is we have the funds to make these payments. We need the votes to get the funding out.”
Senators rejected a committee recommendation and backed legislation (LD 125) to raise the maximum annual amount of tax credits the Finance Authority of Maine may issue to investors under the Maine Seed Capital Tax Credit Program from $5 million to $10 million. 
The Senate unanimously backed an emergency bill (LD 1139) to provide ongoing funding of $6 million a year for crime victim services, citing the likelihood that related federal grants may soon be cut. (More on that here).
Senators voted 19-15 to back the committee recommendation against a bill (LD 16) that would establish separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine. While supporters cited the distance that people in that part of the state have to travel, judicial committee chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said they spent a lot of time working on the proposal but ultimately decided that long term operational and fiscal consequences were too concerning to move forward. 
Senators backed a provision (LD 771) that amends the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances. Supporters said the change addresses a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances.
Some of the other bills that passed the Senate under the hammer, without a roll call: 

LD 375 “An Act to Require the University of Maine School of Law to Provide an Online Degree Program”
LD 504 “An Act to Improve Family Court Procedure”
LD 1456 “An Act to Expand the Number of On-premises Retail Liquor Licenses a Liquor Manufacturer May Be Issued”

House action
Members of the House voted 79-62 to reject legislation (LD 542) that would establish municipal property tax levy limits, restoring provisions of a law that was repealed in 2023.
The House voted 75-67 to reject a resolution (LD 492) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to provide for “parental rights.” (More on this here).
Members of the House voted 75-66 to reject LD 451, which would require operators of wind or solar developments to test for PFAS and, if so, determine if contamination was “reasonably caused” by the development.
The House also rejected a bill (LD 878) to study the effects of 5G on wildlife populations and children. During discussion, bill sponsor Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) said she’s “trying to find answers for constituents.” But chair Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) said the energy committee saw hundreds of studies that showed this is not needed. 
The House voted 77-63 to pass a bill (LD 1080) to prohibit public utilities from requiring deposits based solely on a residential customer’s income. 
Appropriations
Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

LD 461 “An Act to Fund Rural Patrol Services in Washington County”
LD 477 “An Act to Enhance Public Safety in Rural Counties by Providing State Police Patrol and Policing Services”
LD 1061, “An Act to Increase Community Support for Families in Maine”
LD 814 “An Act to Provide Funding to Area Agencies on Aging for Community-based Services and Programs to Support Older Adults”
LD 298 “An Act to Employ Mental Health Personnel Within the Maine State Police”

This week: Nearly 3,0000 grocery store workers threaten strike; paid family and sick leave unscathed in state budget deal; Minnesota employment flat in April; and hundreds of federal workplace safety employees reinstated. 
Nearly 3,0000 grocery store workers threaten strike
Nearly 3,000 workers are headed toward unfair labor practices strikes at 38 grocery stores across the Twin Cities after they rejected the latest offers from UNFI-owned Cub, Haug and Knowlan’s Festival Foods.
It was an unprecedented vote by workers who could walk off the job around Memorial Day if they don’t reach a deal with the companies, according to leaders with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 663.
“They’re not listening. Pure and simple. They’re ignoring everything we’ve suggested,” said Nicolas McBride, assistant meat manager at Haug’s Cub in Minnetonka and member of the bargaining team.
McBride said the companies want to shift more health care costs onto workers, which would more than double his cost and eat up the modest pay raise of $3 per hour spread over the life of the three-year contract.
He also said the companies’ proposed pay raises would only kick in once the contract is ratified, with nothing retroactive to when the contract expired in March. That would add up to hundreds of dollars for workers.
“I’ve been in the union for 28 years and every single contract we’ve gotten back pay,” McBride said.
UFCW Local 663 has been negotiating with the companies since January, along with Lunds & Byerlys, Jerry’s Cub Food, Kowalski’s and Radermacher’s Cub Foods. Workers at those four companies ratified contracts over the weekend, averting a strike.
While the offers were similar, UFCW Local 663 President Rena Wong said the companies made good faith efforts to listen to workers and respond to their proposals. For example at Lunds & Bylerlys, workers wanted to raise part-time wages, particularly for the custodial staff.
“They came back and they made that change. They listened,” Wong said. “That is contrary to what UNFI, Haug’s and Knowlan’s did.”
The union has filed an unfair labor practice charge against UNFI with the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private sector unions, alleging the company has not bargained in good faith. The union also alleges Haug’s and Knowlan’s have violated labor protections for collective bargaining.
In a statement, UNFI said it has been negotiating “diligently and in good faith” and has offered “strong wage increases, continued market-leading union health care and significant increases in our contributions to the union’s pension plan.”
Paid family and sick leave unscathed in global budget deal
Paid family leave and earned sick time came out of difficult budget negotiations largely unscathed under a deal announced by legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday. The deal doesn’t have complete buy-in from progressive Senators because it would roll back access to MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults, however. Much could still change between now and the end of the session.
Paid family leave and earned sick time have faced stiff resistance from business leaders, who have found sympathetic ears among moderate Senate Democrats and newly empowered House Republicans in control of half the lower chamber.
The budget agreement would reduce the maximum payroll tax for the paid family leave program from 1.2% to 1.1%. The change may be insignificant since payroll taxes might never rise to the tax cap, depending on how many people claim benefits. The program is slated to start next year with a payroll tax of .88%, with employers paying at least half of the cost.
The tweak is far less significant than cuts proposed by two moderate Democrats and Republicans earlier this year, which would exempt businesses with 15 or fewer employees and reduce the total number of weeks employees could take off in a year from 20 to 14.
Moderate Senate Democrats also recently voted with Republicans to exempt small farms and businesses from providing paid sick and safe time — at least six days a year for full-time employees — among other changes sought by business leaders. That proposal appears to be dead.
Democrats did make concessions on unemployment insurance for hourly school workers, with legislative leaders agreeing to repeal the benefit in 2029.
School districts complained paying for unemployment for school bus drivers, paraprofessionals and cafeteria workers threatens their tight budgets and makes it harder to fill part-time summer positions. Democrats vowed to protect the benefit, although they will have to win back control of state government to do so if the deal becomes law.
Minnesota employment flat in April
Minnesota employment stayed relatively flat in April, losing 1,300 jobs out of about 3 million statewide, according to data released by the state Department of Employment and Economic Development on Thursday.
The labor market has stayed strong despite upheavals in the global economy since President Donald Trump took office and launched a trade war, halted billions in federal funding, and moved to eliminate more than 120,000 federal jobs.
DEED reported 200 federal jobs lost in Minnesota last month, a small percentage of the 18,000 federal employees in the state, not including postal workers and military personnel. Many of the Trump administration’s layoffs have been reversed or paused, while those workers who took the “Fork in the Road” buyout offer won’t show up in the data until they are off the payroll.
“We would expect to see a drop at some point, it’s just hard to say when,” said Angelina Nguyen, director of the labor market information office at DEED.
Unemployment also ticked up slightly to 3.2% in April, mainly due to 3,300 joining the labor force. The unemployment rate remains 1 percentage point lower than the national rate.
Hundreds of federal workplace safety employees reinstated
The Trump administration reinstated hundreds of laid off workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health this week, including those who screen coal miners for black lung and those who provide services to the first responders to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.
The reversal comes after intense public pressure from unions, members of Congress and a lawsuit brought by a coal miner, which led to a federal judge ordering nearly 200 workers be reinstated on Tuesday. The following day, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told Congress 328 employees at NIOSH had been reinstated.
Some 900 workers, or more than 90% of the entire agency, were planned to be permanently cut as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s campaign to drastically shrink the size of the federal workforce.
The agency, which is part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, helps reduce workplace injuries and illnesses across industries by investigating workplaces to mitigate exposure to toxins, inspecting personal protective equipment for nurses and firefighters, and tracking cancer in firefighters.
On Wednesday, the AFL-CIO, leading a coalition of unions, filed a lawsuit challenging the dismantling of the agency, saying it would lead to more workers dying on the job.
“Working people have fought too hard for these critical protections to now watch an unelected billionaire dismantle them and take us back to a time when chronic disease and death on the job was commonplace,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/493920792_1264876998972980_257142171735395332_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

You can read more about the section here.

Several years ago, I confronted the possibility that I, like many Mississippians, had been blindsided by cancer.
A routine blood test detected alarmingly high PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels, and after informing me that the odds were about 25% for a positive cancer diagnosis and 60% of that for an intermediate to severe form of the disease, my urologist recommended a biopsy. Those odds represented a 15% probability of a metastatic crisis, and given the low risks associated with prostate biopsies, I opted for the procedure.
After an anxious week of waiting, the pathologist’s report indicated that I had dodged the terrifying reality of cancer—unlike for the roughly 16,000 Mississippians who are diagnosed with cancer each year, with an associated annual death toll of about 6,500. 
I am a retired scientist and although my area of expertise involves field biology, my research background helped me evaluate the medical options and procedures related to prostate cancer. I could understand the relevant scientific papers and search for qualities that define good medical research: testable hypotheses, large sample sizes, replicate studies, appropriate statistical analyses and peer-reviewed papers published in reputable journals. When evaluating my options I could avoid ideologically-based claims like those promising that cod liver oil and  other vitamin A supplements are effective for preventing and treating measles.
I also understood that although the initial blood test for PSA antigens, preliminary MRI and biopsy were technological procedures, those procedures were developed through painstaking scientific research—the kinds of research carried out by institutions like the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s (UMMC) Cancer Institute, but now threatened by cuts to federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute and National Science Foundation (NSF).

In other words, the Trump administration is directly harming the kinds of scientific research that could improve the lives of those 16,000 Mississippians who are diagnosed with cancer each year.
In 2023, the UMMC received almost $97 million in research grants, awards and contracts, much of which came from federal funding sources. Cutting NIH funding to the UMMC and other American research institutions threatens the well-being of all Mississippians, regardless of their political affiliation, age, sex, gender, race or ethnicity—or whether their health is threatened by cancer, sickle-cell anemia, heart disease, diabetes, traumatic injury or poor delivery of medical services to underserved populations. Who among us doesn’t know multiple people whose lives have been affected by those diseases or problems? Ironically, it seems that cuts to NIH funding  likely will hit “red states” like Mississippi the hardest. 
Scientific research is a human endeavor, conducted by fallible human beings, as we all are. And yet the core scientific process, which relies on experimental and observational studies, verifiable data and hypotheses that can be tested by multiple independent observers, is the only truly self-correcting discipline—one that rises above the (occasional) false leads, mistakes and pettiness of its individual practitioners to improve the quality of life for everyone.
The scientific process is why we no longer believe that cancer is caused by an excess of black bile, as did physicians in the Middle Ages. We now have targeted gene therapies that dramatically increase survival rates for many types of cancers. It is why we no longer believe that malaria is transmitted by humid and stale air.
And it is why we embrace the germ theory of disease; use antibiotics to treat a variety of diseases, from syphilis to tuberculosis; and employ vaccines to prevent or diminish the damage caused by polio, measles, rubella, whooping cough: on and on and on. The medical benefits derived from high-quality scientific research is one critical reason that average life expectancy in the United States rose from roughly 40 years in 1860 to almost 79 years in 2020. 
Of course, federal researchers and research dollars benefit many other aspects of life in Mississippi besides those related to health care. Proposed cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, which could affect as much as 50% of the workforce at some stations (there are four such stations in Mississippi, supporting research projects on everything from cotton ginning to poultry and insect pest management), would harm the productivity and competitiveness of Mississippi farmers.
Proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)—54% in the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 funding bill—will hamper the ability of the EPA to clean up Mississippi’s nine active Superfund sites, which contain toxic chemicals like PCBs and dioxins.
Or take the impacts of proposed cuts to scientific research by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The Mississippi Gulf Coast is imperiled by rising sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico (almost 2°F between 1970 to 2020), driving increasingly powerful hurricanes, and a sea level rise of up to 10 millimeters/per year, which translates into almost 4 inches of sea level rise per decade, which in turn increases storm-driven flooding. Consequently, along Mississippi’s Gulf Coast homeowner’s insurance is becoming more and more expensive, while the nonrenewal rate by insurance companies is increasing.
Even if one does not “believe” in human-driven climate change, it remains imperative to study sea levels and sea surface temperatures to help protect against the harmful effects of increasingly powerful tropical storms—and the equally damaging effects on homeowner’s insurance rates and availability for Gulf Coast Mississippians.
It also is crucial that we understand the costs of extreme weather events, those causing at least $1 billion dollars, to help insurance companies, policymakers and scientists understand major disasters like the hurricanes that batter the Guld Coast of Mississippi—and yet NOAA will no longer collect these data.
Although scientific research is not primarily a jobs or economic stimulus program, federal research and development funding also contributes in vital ways to overall economic growth, maintaining America’s competitiveness on the world stage and our country’s high standard of living.
Recent analyses suggest that net economic returns for federal research and development dollars are much higher than for other forms of investment such as for physical infrastructure, and may be responsible for as much as 25% of post-World War II productivity and growth—and that contrary to claims by the current administration, public research investments are not less productive than private investments. 
I could describe many more examples of benefits provided by federal science funding, but I will end with one perplexing but illustrative story. Last February, President Trump ordered the release of billions of gallons of water from California reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ostensibly to benefit Central Valley farmers and help Los Angeles fight wildfires like those that devastated the area in January. However, there were no scientific justifications for President Trump’s order, as related to hydrology, irrigation or wildfire suppression
 Still, one Central Valley farmer stated that although the water release was counterproductive, “I have a conservative mindset. I encourage the trigger-pulling attitude, like: ‘Hey, let’s just get stuff done.”
Maybe there are occasions when a “trigger-pulling attitude” is appropriate. But when the gun is aimed at your own head, the results will be predictable and catastrophic—whether we’re talking ill-considered water releases from California dams or indiscriminate and draconian cuts to federal scientific agencies and research funding, which will harm the citizens of Mississippi in so many ways.

Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday told Congress the Trump administration would not cut funding for Head Start, after layoffs at the agency and funding freezes raised fears the six-decade-old program would be radically downsized.
In an appearance before a Senate subcommittee, Kennedy said the administration would “emphasize healthy eating in Head Start, and ensure the program continues to serve its 750,000 children and parents effectively.”
The early education program, which serves children from low-income and homeless families around the country, grapples with staffing shortages and many centers operate in a perpetual state of financial precarity.
[RELATED: New England Head Start office closed; federal funding in flux]
While the program has been spared from elimination, Kennedy has laid off a significant number of employees who helped the program operate and shuttered half its regional offices. Providers have experienced repeated funding delays since President Donald Trump took office, forcing some to briefly close.
In a tense exchange, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, pressed Kennedy on why the federal government delayed sending funding to a Head Start operation outside Milwaukee, forcing it to close.
“What would you say to a parent who shows up for … Head Start and the doors are closed?” she asked him.
“I would be very sad,” Kennedy said. “I fought very hard to make sure Head Start gets all of its funding next year.”
Asked what was causing the delays, Kennedy said he did not know, but suggested the problem came from employees “who wanted to make the Trump administration look bad.”

That’s had a negative impact on commercial property values, which are linked to property taxes that the city depends on. Mayoral candidate Josh Kraft, a nonprofit executive and son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, said city officials should put “everything on the table to bring sources of revenue to the city,” including incentivizing businesses to move to Boston.  Wu said city budget officials are “cinching our belt even tighter,” exercising fiscal discipline by cutting hundreds of jobs that have been vacant. But she also took her first shot of the night at Kraft, pointing to his stance that the city should cut two percent from the budget. That translates into cutting police, fire and city services, she said.Kraft in turn panned her argument that the city couldn’t find small amounts in a $4.6 billion budget that can be cut. “I just find that hard to believe,” he said. “It’s easy to stand on the sidelines when you’re new to the city, new to city policymaking and say cut cut cut and not say from where,” Wu shot back, referring to Kraft moving into Boston in late 2023, ahead of his mayoral run. Two other candidates on the stage – Hyde Park activist Domingos DaRosa and Alex Alex, who decided to run after he was unable to get a city job – had their own ideas. DaRosa said the city should extract more money out of tourists who come into the city, and he suggested conducting an audit to root out misappropriated spending, while Alex suggested stricter traffic enforcement and the implementation of congestion pricing, which charges drivers a fee if they enter the city at certain times of the day. The concept has seen success this year in New York City. The mayoral forum, which lasted roughly two hours, was put together by Democratic groups and moderated by GBH News reporter Saraya Wintersmith. Wu and Kraft are so far the only candidates who have gathered more than the 3,000 signatures needed to qualify for the ballot, while another dozen have expressed interest in running. If more than two candidates get enough voter signatures by May 20, the city plans to hold a nonpartisan preliminary in September, which will winnow the field to two finalists in November. The candidates also touched on K-12 education and higher education. Asked for their priorities on improving Boston Public Schools, Wu noted that the pandemic disrupted school learning, but attendance and graduation rates are up. Kraft said he would focus on increasing literacy rates, especially in the younger grades, and expand access to vocational education.  As for the colleges and universities that power Boston’s economy, Kraft defended their focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, which has come under attack from the Trump administration. “DEI is a crucial part of education because the more diverse an administration is, professorships are, the more you learn, the more experiences you can share with students so people have a deeper understanding,” he said. Wu said Boston should continue speaking up against the Trump administration to “create space” for universities to stand up against intimidation from Washington, D.C. DaRosa said he would like to see universities pay more in taxes to the city, while Alex called the Trump crackdown on higher education the “perfect opportunity” to reshape academia, which has benefited from the slave trade and been the “lapdogs of tyrants.” All the mayoral contenders were asked which Boston ward they live in. The boundaries of wards, a combination of precincts, are used to define key political sections in cities and towns. Wu, who lives in Roslindale, said Ward 18, as did Hyde Park’s DaRosa. “I’m embarrassed to say I don’t know,” said Kraft. Alex, who lives in Dorchester, also said he didn’t know. As the forum wrapped up, Wu leaned over to Kraft and held up three fingers, letting him know he lives in Ward 3.The post City finances top of mind in early days for Boston mayoral candidates appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250515_200822.jpg?fit=1024%2C862&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 11:10:49.504041

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight, via EcoFlight)Production at South Dakota’s only active, large-scale gold mine climbed to its highest level in eight years, according to a new 2024 annual report.
The Wharf Mine, owned by Chicago-based Coeur Mining, is near the city of Lead and the Terry Peak Ski Area in the northern Black Hills. The mine produced 98,042 ounces of gold last year — nearly 5,000 ounces more than the prior year.
The mine also produced 232,013 ounces of silver, which is a lesser-value “co-product” of the gold mining process. Silver production was down about 36,000 ounces from an usually high level in 2023.
To extract all of those minerals last year, miners stripped away 12.9 million tons of earth to access 5 million tons of ore.
State regulators issued a warning letter to the mine in 2021 about selenium pollution in False Bottom Creek, which flows within the mine’s boundaries. Selenium is a naturally occurring mineral in soil, but when it’s turned loose in the environment in large amounts, it can pollute water and be harmful to people and fish.
A staff member for the state Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources said Thursday during a meeting of the state Board of Minerals and Environment that the company is building a new water treatment plant to address the problem. The plant is expected to be operational by October.
The annual report says the mine employs 255 people and paid $12.5 million in state precious-metal severance taxes last year, plus nearly $800,000 in state and local sales taxes.
Coeur Mining’s annual report for investors says it sold $227.6 million worth of gold from the Wharf Mine last year, and $6.4 million worth of silver, for a total of $234 million. That was a 25% increase from 2023.
From those proceeds, the company said it made donations to 55 Black Hills-area entities, such as nonprofits and school groups, totaling $220,000.
The company operates additional mines in Nevada, Alaska and Mexico, and reported total 2024 precious-metal sales of more than $1 billion.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_0415-scaled-e1684864040881-1024x692.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

His appointment signals a new chapter for the Office of the Marijuana Commissioner (OMC), the regulatory agency tasked with implementing and enforcing the Delaware Marijuana Control Act, which took effect on July 5, 2023.
OMC’s mission is to oversee the adult-use and medical marijuana industry with a focus on public health, preventing underage use, ensuring equity, and generating tax revenue through a safe and well-regulated market.
Sanderlin brings over 15 years of experience advising businesses, investors, and policymakers on marijuana regulation and public policy. As principal of Sanderlin Strategies, he has worked across multiple jurisdictions to support licensing, compliance, and the development of marijuana programs. Previously, he practiced law at Greenberg Traurig, where he represented clients in regulatory and legislative matters.
“Josh Sanderlin’s depth of regulatory experience and his focus on equity and transparency will be critical as we create a system that protects public health, promotes opportunity, and delivers on the promise of responsible legalization,” said Governor Matt Meyer.
Sanderlin holds a Juris Doctor from the Catholic University of America, a Master of Public Administration from Florida State University, and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Jacksonville University. He is widely respected for his commitment to transparency, equity, and good governance in emerging industries.
OMC also recognizes the leadership of Deputy Commissioner Paul Hyland, who has played a key role in advancing the state’s marijuana program during the transitional period. “OMC is excited to welcome Commissioner Sanderlin and to hear his vision for the future of this office,” said Hyland.
“I’m honored to serve as Delaware’s Marijuana Commissioner,” said Sanderlin. “I look forward to working with the dedicated team at OMC and partners across the marijuana industry to build a safe, well-regulated market that delivers real justice and lasting benefits to all Delawareans.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Senate voted to enact new rules to streamline the voting process in Alaska and expand voter access. If signed into law, the legislation would update the state’s voter rolls, mandate that the state pay for postage for mailed ballots, introduce a new ballot tracking system, and repeal a requirement that a witness sign absentee ballots, among other changes. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 64 along caucus lines, voting 14 to 6 on Monday. The bill now moves to the House for consideration in the last week of the legislative session. 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and a bill supporter, called it a “compromise bill” years in the making at a news conference on Tuesday. “It includes 12 different bills that have been introduced over the years from members of all political parties — Republicans, Democrats, independents, minority and majority members,” he said. “Roughly 50% of the bill is at the request of the minority in the House and the Senate. So it is truly a compromise bill.”
Wielechowski said the first goal of the bill is to update the state’s voter rolls. “We have 106% more registered voters in the state than we have citizens, and so it takes some steps to fix that,” he said.
 
 Under SB 64, the Division of Elections would send a notice to confirm address if the voter has: 

Registered to vote in a another state
Received a driver’s license in another state
Registered a vehicle in another state
Served on a jury in another state
Obtained a resident hunting or fishing license in another state
Pays resident tuition at at university in another state
Receives a residential property tax exemption in another state
Receives public assistance in another state 



If passed, the bill clarifies residency as “as a place where a voter has a reasonable and articulable plan to return to whenever they are absent.” The bill would shorten the timeframe in which Alaskans are marked as inactive voters and can ultimately be removed from the voter rolls if they don’t vote. It also would expand the list of things that trigger notices to start that removal process.
Once those notices are sent, the voter will have a chance to respond within 45 days, or be moved to an inactive status for a period of 28 months, or two elections. In that time, a voter can confirm residency and their voter registration by contacting the division, or by voting. 
Wielechowski said the bill addresses the causes of ballots being disqualified, by eliminating the witness signature requirement for absentee ballots and allowing mistakes to be corrected ahead of Election Day. 
“It fixes a number of issues that have resulted in voters’ ballots being thrown out, particularly military voters, and particularly those in rural Alaska: There’s a witness signature problem,” he said. 
Wielechowski pointed to House District 18, which includes Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, as having the highest rate of reject ballots in the last election. 
In the 2024 general election, the state rejected 1,303 absentee ballots, or 1.7% of ballots cast. Nearly 40%, or 512 ballots were rejected due to “improper or insufficient witnessing.” That was fewer than the special election in 2022 following the death of U.S. Rep. Don Young, when over 7,500 ballots were rejected, with a third of those due to a lack of witness signature. 
If passed, the bill would allow for voters to fix minor errors, with the division notifying and allowing the voter an opportunity to correct a mistake before Election Day, a process called “ballot curing.”  
The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, which advocates for civil and voter rights, has been calling for both items, and supports the bill, according to Michael Garvey, its policy director.
“We’ve seen it lead to completely unnecessary rejections,” he said. 
He noted that rejection rates have been higher in rural districts, as well as districts with higher proportions of Alaska Native voters.
“And so someone who’s taken the time to fill out their ballot, put it in the mail, put a stamp on it, and a lot of cases to have that rejected, and then just to be notified that it didn’t end up counting, that’s pretty dispiriting,” Garvey said. “And so the state really should have a way to allow voters to fix that small amount of mistakes.”
The ACLU filed a lawsuit in 2022 asserting the state violated due process rights when rejecting ballots without notice or opportunity to correct errors. The Alaska Superior Court denied the motion in a January ruling, but said that the Legislature could enact a “notice-and-cure system.”
Under the legislation, voters would be notified of technical mistakes before an election and be able to correct them. Voters would not be able to open the envelope and change their vote, but be able to fix external mistakes, such as missing a signature. The division would notify the voter within 24 hours, by email or phone number, and the voter would be able to provide identification and correct the mistake by filling out and submitting a form.
The bill also establishes a new ballot tracking system, so voters can be notified when their ballot is received and counted. It also provides for paid postage for all absentee ballots.
Other new provisions in the bill include:

Adding tribal identification cards to the list of acceptable voter identification in person and by mail;
Removing hunting and fishing licenses from the list of voter identification; 
Establishing a new rural community liaison position within the Division of Elections to support rural districts, including recruitment and training of poll workers;
Requiring that secure ballot drop boxes be available at every division office, and allowing municipalities to provide drop boxes in accordance with division regulations;
Requiring the state to develop a cybersecurity program, and notify the public if there is a data breach;
Requiring that absentee ballot counting start 12 days before the election; and
Requiring the division to publish results for all rankings in the precinct results.

The Division of Elections has estimated that if passed, the bill’s new provisions, staff salaries and cost of paid postage would cost $765,000 in one-time costs and $190,000 annually. 
However, Republican members of the Senate objected to what they say is not enough security protocols to prevent opportunities for voter fraud.
“We have a moniker: You want to make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat,” said Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla in an interview Thursday. “I want to be clear that I’ve never said fraud swung an election. I said I want to make sure we don’t have the potential for fraud, which I think the Division of Elections director agrees with.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXShower said he opposed removing the witness signature, without another kind of verification check. “We suggested several things, like doing what the Permanent Fund Division, use their data, have two attesters… (who) under the penalty of perjury, would have to attest that yes, you are, in fact, her (the voter),” he said, and it was rejected by the bills sponsors. 
Shower also opposed several items, including ballot drop boxes, and has concerns about the language around residency and whether voter rolls are accurate or updated. He said he also has concerns that mail-in absentee ballots present a scenario where they’re fraudulently filled out, and the division cannot verify the true identity of the voter. “Who knows where they went? Who knows how many of them came back? We have no idea,” he said. 
Opponents of these proposals have pointed out that there isn’t much evidence of Alaskans committing the crime of voter fraud. The state has investigated a few cases – the current system catches when two ballots are submitted for the same voter, which has been extremely rare, and can result when a voter forgets that they had already cast a mailed ballot. 
Shower said he’s concerned about personal data breaches like in 2020, where an estimated 113,000 voters’ personal data was exposed, and he wants to see the state take more serious security protocols.
The bill is now being heard in the House Finance Committee and is expected to move to a full House vote in the final days of the session, which ends May 21.

(Provided by the S.C. Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — A condemned inmate is scheduled for execution in one of his two death penalty cases, the state Supreme Court said in a Friday order.
Stephen Stanko, 57, is set to be put to death at 6 p.m. June 13. His execution would be the sixth in the state since the process resumed in September following an unintended 13-year hiatus.
  Stephen Stanko, 57, is scheduled to be executed June 13. (Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)
Stanko was sentenced to death twice, in two separate cases for crimes committed within two days of each other in 2005.
The U.S. Supreme Court turned down his final appeal for a 2009 conviction earlier this month. Appeals are ongoing in his other death sentence, which a jury recommended as part of a 2006 conviction.
By law, Stanko will have until May 30, two weeks before he’s set to die, to choose his method of execution.
The death warrant comes as attorneys raise questions about the state’s protocols for execution by firing squad, an option added by legislators in 2021. Two inmates in the last two months chose to die that way.
In the most recent execution, which took place April 11, marksmen mostly missed inmate Mikal Mahdi’s heart, attorneys claimed.
An autopsy photo showed two bullet holes in his chest where attorneys would have expected three, one from each gun shot at him, attorneys said in a filing to the state Supreme Court last week.
Prison officials have said nothing went wrong. Fragments of bullets struck Mahdi’s heart, and two bullets hit the same spot and took the same trajectory through his body, explaining the two wounds, said prisons spokeswoman Chrysti Shain.
Stanko also has the option to die by lethal injection, which three of the five inmates executed in the last eight months chose, or electrocution, which no inmate in the state has selected since 2008.
Stanko’s crime spree started April 7, 2005, when he strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death at her home in Murrell’s Inlet while beating and raping her 15-year-old daughter, according to court documents. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before stealing jewelry and credit cards and fleeing.
He went to his friend’s house in Conway. After having breakfast with his friend Henry Turner, Stanko shot the 74-year-old in the back while he shaved in the bathroom mirror, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun, according to court documents.
Stanko then hit Turner in the head and fatally shot him in the chest.
Driving Turner’s truck, Stanko went to Columbia, where he spent an evening buying people drinks at bars before traveling to Augusta, Georgia. There, Stanko convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament and went home with her, according to court records.
Stanko stayed with the woman, including attending church with her, until April 12, when he left abruptly in the middle of the night. Soon after he left, the woman recognized his photo in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death and called the police, who captured Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
During Stanko’s trials, defense attorneys argued to no avail that he was insane at the time of the killings, with decreased brain functioning making him unable to understand right and wrong.
A jury convicted Stanko in 2006 of killing Ling and beating and raping her daughter. A separate jury convicted him in 2009 of killing Turner. Both juries recommended death sentences, which multiple courts have affirmed.
Turner’s killing is the crime for which Stanko is set to be put to death in June.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

Financial institutions serving Delaware’s underserved neighborhoods now have a new opportunity to support local economic growth, thanks to a newly launched state fund aimed at increasing access to capital in low- to moderate-income areas.
The Delaware Council on Banking has opened applications for the Delaware Community Investment Venture Fund (DCIVF), a program designed to help banks, credit unions, and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) develop and deploy innovative financial products in communities that have historically lacked access to capital and financial services.
“The Delaware Community Investment Venture Fund reflects our ongoing commitment to fostering equitable economic development across the state,” said Governor Matt Meyer. “By providing targeted support to financial institutions serving low-to-moderate-income communities, we are strengthening the foundation for inclusive growth and long-term prosperity in Delaware.”

Eligible institutions can apply for grants that support projects aimed at developing and testing new financial products, underwriting tools, or services.
The goal is to enhance access to funding and capital for businesses operating in underserved areas.
“I created the community investment venture fund to build an economic ecosystem that provides more access to capital,” said Sen. Darius Brown, D-Wilmington. “Commerce is the life’s blood of our economy and through intentional investments, we are the place where opportunity lives.”
Applications for the DCIVF opened on May 15, and must be submitted by 5 p.m. on June 16.
An optional virtual information session will be held on May 22 at 3 p.m. for interested applicants.
“The Fund aligns with our regulatory priorities of ensuring fair access to financial services and strengthening the safety and soundness of institutions serving vulnerable communities,” said State Bank Commissioner Robert Glen. “We encourage banks, credit unions, and CDFIs to apply.”

Assanis, who has served as the University’s 28th president since 2016, announced his plans to step down on June 30.
Carlson, who joined UD in 2022 as its 12th provost, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to lead the institution during the transition period.
According to Kelly, the board will launch a national search for a permanent president during the upcoming academic year.
As provost, Carlson has played a central role in advancing the University’s academic mission.
Her initiatives have included integrating long-term financial, enrollment and hiring strategies, expanding academic offerings, and fostering innovation through programs like the New Program Incubator and the One Idea, One Slide Summit.
She has also been an advocate for improving academic spaces and creating flexible pathways for students to complete their degrees.
Before joining UD, Carlson held multiple leadership roles over more than two decades at the University of Notre Dame.
Her career there included service as vice president, associate provost, and dean of the Graduate School, where she emphasized holistic student development and strategic planning.
An expert in spatial cognition, Carlson holds a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is widely published in her field.
She has served on editorial boards of leading cognitive science journals and governing boards of professional societies.
The transition marks a pivotal moment for the University as it begins the process of identifying its next permanent leader.
“I am honored and humbled to be stepping in to guide this very special institution, and I thank the Board of Trustees for their confidence and support,” Carlson said. “I look forward to convening campus conversations this summer and fall to reaffirm our mission and identity and to together design a path forward that is uniquely our own.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/provost-carlson-laura-portraits-061022-003-udaily-story-page-800x533-1.jpg,,,2025-05-16 10:07:03.823876

(Stock photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Iowa State University scientists say their research could lead to better methods of recognizing when someone is experiencing mental health struggles based on their online presence, making it easier to offer resources to those in need.
ISU assistant professor of information systems and business analytics Wenli Zhang, in collaboration with researchers at universities in Delaware and Rhode Island, has developed a “deep learning model” for detecting mental health symptoms on social media, The model factors in more than just positive and negative sentiments on a subject that a person might post online.
This method could and would not replace medical diagnoses, Zhang said. But in the future, she said, the learning model could be used as a tool to provide additional information and resources to those expressing symptoms of mental health issues and to study population-level data over a period of time.
“Maybe we can use big data and machine learning to help … this process,” Zhang said. “Because nowadays, not just in the United States or other countries but in the entire world, mental disorders, especially depression, are underdiagnosed and undertreated.”

The team used a large dataset sourced from Reddit by a different group and offered to researchers for their own work, Zhang said, but the learning model her group created allowed them to dive deeper than others.
Zhang said the goal behind deep learning is to use data to identify patterns in order to detect connections and predict outcomes. As social media data is much more than just numbers in rows and columns, she said the model used to sift through it needed to be intricate.
“When we have unstructured data, like natural language or images, the patterns are very complicated,” Zhang said. “The size of the inputs are very large, so we need a very complex model to … identify the patterns.”
The difference between the team’s new deep learning model and others is what data it pulled as evidence of possible mental health symptoms, Zhang said.
While previous research has relied on “sentiment scores” calculated by finding language expressing someone’s positive or negative emotions in their posts, Zhang said they found little connection between these scores and depression diagnoses. Posters could be referring to something specific they did or didn’t like, she said, like movies or music, which is not what researchers were looking for.
Instead of trying to employ the same method, Zhang said the team turned to language used in more clinical settings when it comes to research and diagnosis, then tried matching it to more natural text and speech.
One example she gave was the term “attempted suicide” — found in clinical writing, but not often on social media. The team used “natural language processing techniques” to link informal language from Reddit to formal terms, Zhang said, then looked at how many times the poster would “mention the symptoms or treatments or major life events that may exacerbate mental disorders.”
Zhang said her experience with modeling such as this comes from her background working in health care analytics during her Ph.D. studies. She used machine learning to track social media data to detect symptoms of asthma and other conditions.
When she came to ISU and began teaching, Zhang said she found depression and other mental health conditions to be a big issue. She said she hopes that in the future, the model can be used by social media platforms as a tool to support at-risk people, like providing a pop-up message with relevant resources and the statement that they are not alone.
“Maybe they can use our tools to identify, maybe, the teenagers that need more help, or maybe senior people that need more help,” Zhang said.

From CalMatters politics reporter Yue Stella Yu: 
In the state Legislature, an open rebellion sometimes does wonders. 
Two weeks ago, Assemblymember Maggy Krell, a first-year Sacramento Democrat, publicly defied Democratic leaders in attempting to pass harsher penalties for soliciting sex from 16- and 17-year-olds. Joined by some moderate Democrats and Republicans, the fight laid bare the splinters among Democrats and forced Assembly leaders into damage control mode. 
The end result? An overwhelming Assembly vote on Thursday to raise penalties for teen sex solicitation, with no votes in opposition. 
The measure — amended after a weeklong negotiation between Krell and Assembly Democratic leaders — would allow prosecutors to charge someone soliciting sex from a child more than three years younger than them with a felony. It would also increase the fines on businesses and hotels for facilitating or shielding sex trafficking activities and require the Office of Emergency Services to fund up to 11 district attorneys’ efforts to prosecute human trafficking. 
It was a victory lap for Republicans, who have long fought to enhance punishments for child sex trafficking and solicitation. During a Thursday press conference, they urged Senate Democrats, who will consider the measure next, to leave it intact.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego: “Don’t you dare water down a word in AB 379 as passed today. We will not tolerate any weakening of the tools that law enforcement needs to protect these children.”

It is unclear how Senate Democrats will respond. Last year, Senate Democrats removed provisions from a Republican-backed proposal that would have applied harsher penalties to soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds — the same provisions that Krell unsuccessfully fought for this year. 
Krell, who was stripped off of the bill as a principal author after her defiance, told CalMatters she is “thankful” to others for cooperating. 
Her takeaway after all this drama? 

Krell: “I’m easy to work with, hard to f—k with.”

Support for Hollywood, not so much for news

As California faces a $12 billion budget shortfall, Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing to expand support for one industry, while reducing support for another. 
In recent years California’s film industry has been struggling due to pandemic-era production shutdowns, labor strikes, deadly wildfires and competitive tax incentives offered by other states. 
The Legislature is considering a bill that would expand the state’s film and television tax credits and set aside as much as $750 million annually to film production. It would also raise the tax break applicants can receive, and extend the credit to live action and animated series. 
The bill is backed by motion picture studios, unions representing entertainment industry workers and Newsom, who told reporters on Wednesday, “we need to step things up,” when it comes to supporting the state’s film industry.
At the same time, the governor wants to reduce the first-year payment the state is required to provide to help fund local news outlets from $30 million to $10 million. H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance, said in an email the proposed cut is due to “fewer resources than projected in the January budget.”
The money stems from a deal lawmakers brokered with Google last year: To support California’s beleaguered journalism industry, the state and the tech giant agreed to put millions of dollars into a fund to be distributed to outlets over five years. In exchange, the Legislature pulled two bills that would have forced tech companies to pay outlets for their content. To date, no money has been distributed to news outlets.

GOP wants to preempt state AI laws, including CA

Though it’s unlikely that a congressional bill to implement a decade-long ban on state governments from regulating artificial intelligence will pass out of the U.S. Senate, proponents of AI regulation are still ringing alarm bells about the bill’s broad implications.
As CalMatters’ Khari Johnson explains, Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives included the AI proposal in a sweeping budget reconciliation bill. On Wednesday the House approved that budget bill along party lines. Now sitting before the Senate, the AI proposal faces tough odds since federal rules require that budget reconciliation bills be strictly related to fiscal matters.
But if passed, the legislation would make enforcing over 20 laws California passed last year illegal. It would also jeopardize 30 bills the state Legislature is currently considering to regulate AI, including ones to protect consumers from AI-powered price gouging, or require reporting when health insurance companies use AI to deny care.
Proponents of the bill say a moratorium is necessary to resolve a patchwork of state regulation. But the proposal also aligns with efforts by the President Donald Trump administration to curb AI regulation, which it argues stifles innovation. A White House plan to advance the AI industry’s growth by lifting some regulations is expected this summer.

And lastly: Mental health crisis calls

If you live in Sacramento County and you call the Sheriff’s Department because someone in your family is having a mental health crisis, there’s a chance they may not come. That’s because of a new policy that says deputies will only respond to those calls if a crime has already occurred, is in progress or the person in crisis is putting someone else in imminent danger. 
But this isn’t just a Sacramento issue. An investigation by CalMatters contributor Lee Romney has found that other police agencies are also backing away from mental health crisis calls. 
This week Lee joined the health policy podcast Tradeoffs to break down her findings. Listen here.

Gary Peters.
They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.
More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.
St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”
Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.
Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.
In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.
“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.
 Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).
Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.
These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.
During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored. The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.
“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.
 Energy inequality across America

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see. Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.
At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.
That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.
 The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.
In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.
Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.
“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”
DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.
Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.
One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.
“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.
There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.
 The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods. “I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.
For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.
Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.
However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.
“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.
 Solar helps cool city 

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.
The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.
Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”
In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.
The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate income households.
“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.
Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.
“Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

Gavin Newsom’s latest budget proposal lays out deep cuts to public universities and health care.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest budget proposal lays out deep cuts to public universities and health care. It also seeks to more than double the tax credits for Hollywood studios — an expansion moving smoothly through the state Legislature.


Staring down a $12 billion budget deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed steep cuts to California’s health care services and public universities — all while promising more dollars to Hollywood.
Newsom on Wednesday doubled down on his proposal to expand the state’s investment in film and television tax credits, incentives created by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2009 to boost California’s marquee industry. If passed, the state would allocate up to $750 million each year to film production, up from the current $330 million. 
Despite saying that any funding request from Los Angeles unrelated to disaster recovery would be a “non-starter,” Newsom deemed the tax credit expansion essential to reviving an ailing industry. 
“It’s on life support,” he told reporters. “We need to step things up, and this is all part and parcel of economic recovery, economic growth.”
Newsom’s plan would also increase the amount each qualified applicant can receive, extend the credit to live action and animated series and devote more money toward independent films.
But his proposal has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans who argue the state should prioritize essential programs in a tight budget year. Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Chico called Newsom’s proposal “tone-deaf.”
“I’m not sure the rest of California will be OK with their senior programs, their disability programs, their education programs being cut in order to prop up a regional industry,” said Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Moreno Valley Democrat. 
Some lawmakers warned that other states could respond with even more aggressive incentives, creating a “race to the bottom.” 
“It seems eminently predictable that we will be back next year with a proposal that says: ‘We’ve fallen behind again. I don’t know what happened. And now we need to do more,’” said Sen. Christopher Cabaldon, a Napa Democrat, in March. 
Despite those concerns, the proposal has advanced in the state Legislature with little resistance. Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Los Angeles Democrat who chairs the powerful budget committee, told CalMatters that anyone seeking large funding increases this year “should stop wasting people’s time” because there isn’t enough money.
Newsom’s proposal is different, Gabriel said, because it would expand a longstanding, tested program that would also help offset the impact of the LA wildfires.
For Newsom, a lame-duck governor with presidential ambitions, expanding the tax credits could please the wealthy Hollywood donors who could propel his campaign. 
But the handout can easily be portrayed as a tax break for the rich.
“The ads kind of make themselves,” said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento. “It’s been effective in previous years to … use (Hollywood) as an example of unserious, privileged waste.”
Saving Hollywood
Hollywood has suffered. A “quadruple-whammy” of the COVID-19 pandemic that shut down productions, a Hollywood writers strike, deadly wildfires and growing production incentives from other states that lured movies out of California have decreased its nationwide share in film industry employment from 54% in 2010 to 46% in 2023, according to the bill analysis. Film production levels in Los Angeles also saw a sharp drop-off in recent years.
The industry is also struggling to compete globally, so much so that even President Donald Trump has weighed in, ordering a 100% tariff on overseas productions, though he has given no details. In response, Newsom has offered to work with Trump to develop a $7.5 billion federal tax credit. 
“I applaud President Trump for recognizing that we are losing a lot of films to foreign countries, and I hope he steps up,” Newsom said Wednesday.

The proposed state film tax credit expansion has united motion picture studios and entertainment industry workers, but it is the unions that have been leading the fight. 
The groups backing the plan have poured at least $8.4 million into lawmakers’ coffers since 2015, including nearly $6.5 million from the California State Council of Laborers alone, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. Walt Disney, a top supporter, has given nearly $750,000 to lawmakers since 2015.
Dozens of unionized workers have filled legislative hearing rooms and spilled into the hallways as they testify in support. 
“We are the thousands of artisans whose names whip by in the credit roll at the end of the movie. Not those that appear in huge letters and fade slowly at the beginning of the movie. We don’t go to the award shows. We work the award shows,” said Renata Ray, representing a chapter of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.
Nalder said that is a smart political move since labor unions hold so much political sway with Democratic lawmakers. 
And the tax credit expansion “touches both the struggling workers as well as international mega-stars,” said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at University of California-San Diego. 
Still, the funding could backfire on Newsom as he eyes a potential White House run in 2028.
“You’ve got to think about policies’ effect on your core supporters … but also the average voters in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, who may not see someone who’s helping bail out Hollywood as someone taking the nation in the direction they want to see,” Kousser said.
Do film tax credits work?
California’s film tax credit was created in response to other states’ incentives. As of last year, 37 states had similar incentives. California’s program is often compared to the unlimited tax credit in Georgia, a frequent destination for film production, and New York’s incentives, which were raised last week, from $700 million to $800 million a year. 
But California’s program is unique: It is the only state to award credits based on the likelihood of a project creating jobs and boosting the economy. It is also one of the few states to prohibit using the tax credits to pay “above-the-line” crews, such as directors, actors or writers. 
The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office said there is “good evidence that tax credits increase production activity” and it could increase the size of the state’s film industry.
That is partly because some studios choose to film elsewhere when they are denied tax incentives. Between 2011 and 2013, roughly two thirds of the applicants who did not receive tax credits in California shot out of state, according to a 2016 report by the legislative analyst. And between 2020 and 2023, almost 60% of applicants who were denied the tax credits produced out of state, according to a 2023 report by the California Film Commission, which administers the credits.
But would the tax credit boost the state’s broader economy? Research is mixed.
A study of California’s first film tax credit program, which used a lottery system to award credits, found major studios that received the incentives spent and hired more in California. 
Supporters of the California proposal, such as Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Zbur, a Los Angeles lawmaker who introduced the legislation — argue that the program “pays for itself.” They frequently cite a 2023 analysis by the nonprofit Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation which concluded that for every dollar the state spent on the tax credits, state and local governments collected $1.07 in tax revenue. It also said each dollar invested led to $24.40 in economic activity and $8.60 in increased wages.  
“Every show that shoots in California supports hundreds of jobs. It pumps money into local economies from lumber yards to restaurants, from car rentals to dry cleaners,” said Ed Lammi, a former Sony Pictures Television executive, in an opinion piece citing the research.
The study was prepared for the Motion Picture Association, one of the legislation’s top supporters. The association has given lawmakers $168,000 since 2015, Digital Democracy data shows. 
But while some studies show some evidence that filmmakers are drawn to states with better incentives, the legislative analyst’s office and most researchers have concluded that states almost always lose money on such programs, and that the credits have little to no effect on a state’s economic growth or its job market. 
Michael Thom, a professor at the University of Southern California, wrote to lawmakers in March that his research showed the programs generally failed to create jobs or increase wages. “Simply put, California cannot afford the existing incentive, much less a substantial expansion to it,” he said. 
Mike Gatto, a Los Angeles Democrat who authored the first expansion of the film tax credit program in 2014, said he is skeptical about subsidizing the film industry without addressing the root causes of its problems.
“It is doubtful that the amount of money that the state gives to this industry proves to be something that we get back,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/010425_Golden-Globes_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

Now the state is pulling back some of its commitments. Google could follow suit.,"In summary
Google and California struck a deal last year to fund local news. Now the state is pulling back some of its commitments. Google could follow suit.


A controversial $125 million deal California struck with Google last year to prop up the state’s struggling journalism industry is already on track to shrink — before any of the money has been delivered to news outlets.
The deal, announced last August, committed California and Google to each put tens of millions of dollars into a fund to be distributed to local news outlets over five years. In exchange, lawmakers scrapped two ambitious proposals that sought to force the search engine behemoth and its tech counterparts to pay outlets for using their published content.
But Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday proposed to slash the state’s initial commitment to the journalism fund by two-thirds. 
Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer wrote in an email that the administration is seeking to reduce the state’s first-year payment of $30 million to $10 million solely because of “fewer resources than projected in the January budget.” The cut is part of Newsom’s May budget proposal, in which he’s seeking to close an estimated $12 billion shortfall for the 2025-2026 fiscal year that begins in July. 
The proposal to reduce the state’s share of the funding outraged local news advocates and proponents of requiring tech platforms to pay journalism outlets for their content — who already called last year’s deal insufficient. It raises questions about Google’s commitment to paying its share of the matching funds, and the overall status of the agreement which was announced in August but appears to have made little progress toward becoming reality. 
There were no signed term sheets in Google’s handshake deal with the state and with lawmakers last year — only public promises. 
“It’s extremely disappointing,” said Steven Waldman, president of the journalism advocacy group Rebuild Local News. “It was already too small and they’ve walked in the wrong direction from it at a time when the collapse of community news in California continues … Pink slime and rumor and misinformation is flooding into the vacuum so time is of the essence to try to turn this around. Instead, the effort is shrinking.”
A draft of the deal released last year suggested UC Berkeley would administer the funding program; the university has since declined to do so and the state has not announced a new administrator. As a result, Google also does not appear to have made its first-year payment of $15 million toward the fund, Waldman said.
The deal did not include strict timelines, but proponents said they aimed to “front-load” much of the money in the first year, which they believed could garner more private contributions along the way.
Deal struck after millions in lobbying from Google
Neither Newsom’s office nor Google responded to inquiries. The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a lobbying group that last year was largely bankrolled by Google to oppose the news bills, declined to comment. Google’s payments to influence state lawmakers surged to almost $11 million from July through September last year when the bills were under consideration – 90 times more than it has ever spent on lobbying in California over the same period of time.
A spokesperson for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who negotiated the deal last year in exchange for abandoning her bill that would have required platforms such as Google and Meta to either pay a fee or negotiate with news outlets for using their news content, said there would be “more information to share on this in the coming days.”
Wicks, in a statement, did not address the proposal to cut state funding. Instead the Oakland Democrat thanked Newsom for “for making an essential public investment that strengthens journalism” and described the funding as a “down payment, combined with those of private and philanthropic partners.”
After the first-year payments, Google and the state both were to put $10 million a year into the fund for four more years. 
The company also agreed to continue paying $10 million a year in existing grants to newsrooms — money it had threatened to withhold if the legislation passed. And it planned to put $17.5 million into an unspecified artificial intelligence program that had given some journalists and their union representatives anxiety over job losses. 
Now, Waldman is worried the state’s reduction in funding could prompt the company to do the same. As part of the deal, Google specified it would only pay into the journalism fund as a match to state dollars, said former Sen. Steve Glazer, the author of the other bill that was scrapped.
“They did not want a precedent to be set in California that could be easily replicated in other states, so they insisted upon a state match,” he said. “The fact that the governor is proposing to renege on (part of the deal) is a cherry on top for Google and it allows them to reduce their contribution if they desire.”
Glazer’s bill would have imposed a fee on major tech platforms to provide news outlets a tax credit to employ local journalists. The measure, legislative staff estimated, would have raised $500 million a year. Wick’s bill requiring the platforms to negotiate payments to news outlets was modeled on similar programs in Canada and Australia, but the political headwinds were tough in the tech companies’ home state. 
Lawmakers pursued both proposals to try to stem the decline of the news industry in California.  
Following a nationwide trend, media companies have hemorrhaged jobs over the past two decades as advertisers fled print media for the internet and technological advancements reshaped how readers consume news. The state has lost one-third of its newspapers since 2005 in a trend experts say worsens civic engagement, polarization and misinformation.
To try to keep their readers, publications increasingly rely on social media and online search. Google controls the lion’s share of search in a way the U.S. Justice Department and one federal judge have said violates antitrust law.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525-Google-LS-Getty-001-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

A new podcast episode revisits CalMatters’ recent story on police stepping back from mental health calls, and what that shift means for crisis response systems.


“Mental illness is not a crime” has become a rallying cry for improving the treatment of people in crisis. As the health care podcast Tradeoffs explained last year in its special three-part series “The Fifth Branch,” more than 100 communities across the U.S. now send mental health experts instead of armed police to certain 911 calls. 
Now, a handful of sheriff’s departments in California have started refusing to respond to some 911 calls that involve mental health issues. The most prominent official involved is Sacramento Sheriff Jim Cooper, who announced in February that, going forward, his deputies would only respond to mental health calls if a crime had been committed or was in process, or if someone other than the person in crisis was in imminent danger.
 
 

“We wear the badge, we carry the gun,” Cooper said at his press conference announcing the new policy. “We deal with crime, not mental health crises.”
Veteran journalist Lee Romney has covered mental health issues in California for nearly 25 years and witnessed the growing consensus that police should be less involved in mental health crises. Lee was shocked by Cooper’s announcement.
“It seemed like he was throwing the baby out with the bathwater,” Lee told Tradeoffs. “Law enforcement is recognizing that things go better for them when they collaborate with clinicians, with paramedics. I think he’s just taken it a step beyond.”
Lee wrote about the new policy for CalMatters. She talked with Cooper and other law enforcement leaders, along with family members of people with severe mental illness.
You can listen to the full conversation with Lee below or read the transcript on Tradeoffs. It includes the powerful story of a scared mother who felt abandoned when her teenage daughter was in crisis and Sacramento deputies refused to respond.
Here are a few takeaways from Tradeoffs’ conversation with Lee:

Lee says Sheriff Cooper’s decision to pull back on mental health calls was motivated in part by concerns over legal liability. Cooper has cited a recent federal court ruling that held two Las Vegas police officers liable for killing a mentally ill man in 2019. But other legal experts say Cooper’s concern is misplaced. They say cops still have legal protections when answering mental health calls.
At least a handful of sheriff’s departments are following Sacramento’s lead. “I think that they are trying to make a point,” Lee said of these departments. “They’re trying to force a broader conversation and say, ‘Hey, it’s not our job to fix the mental health crisis problem.’ ”
Critics — including lawmakers, firefighters and community members — worry Cooper’s policy will put civilians and first responders at risk. But Lee says some mental health advocates are cheering the move. Cooper’s decision, they say, has pushed Sacramento to increase its efforts to come up with better ways to respond to mental health crises without sending the police.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/022822-Sacramento-County-Sheriff-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601
,California,2025-05-16 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Congress might strip Californians of protections against AI in health care, hiring, and much more",Khari Johnson,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/05/state-ai-regulation-ban/,House Republicans want to ban state AI regulations for 10 years. California leaders are alarmed.,"In summary
House Republicans want to ban state AI regulations for 10 years. California leaders are alarmed.




House Republicans moved to cut off artificial intelligence regulation by the states before it can take root, advancing legislation in Congress that, in California, would make it unlawful to enforce more than 20 laws passed by the Legislature and signed into law last year.
The moratorium, bundled in to a sweeping budget reconciliation bill this week, also threatens 30 bills the California Legislature is currently considering to regulate artificial intelligence, including one that would require reporting when an insurance company uses AI to deny health care and another that would require the makers of AI to evaluate how the tech performs before it’s used to decide on jobs, health care, or housing.
The California Privacy Protection Agency sent a letter to Congress Monday that says the moratorium “could rob millions of Americans of rights they already enjoy” and threatens critical privacy protections approved by California voters in 2020, such as the right to opt out of business use of automated decisionmaking technology and transparency about how their personal information is used.
If passed, the law would stop legislative efforts in the works nationwide. Lawmakers from 45 states are or have considered nearly 600 draft bills to regulate artificial intelligence this year, according to the Transparency Coalition, a group that tracks AI policy efforts by state lawmakers and supports legislation to regulate the technology.
The measure was introduced by Congressman Brett Guthrie, a Republican from Kentucky and chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee who said the legislation is necessary to resolve a patchwork of state regulation. On Wednesday, members of Congress in that House committee voted 30-24 along party lines to approve the budget reconciliation bill that includes the moratorium on state AI regulation. It will now advance to the House floor and potentially the Senate, where some observers say it faces an uphill battle against rules that limit policy changes in budget proposals.
As written, the moratorium would lift after 10 years. But it would have plenty of impact in the meantime, said Ben Winters, an attorney for the Consumer Federation of America. In California, he thinks the legislation could halt efforts by the Privacy Protection Agency to regulate automated decisionmaking, prevent enforcement of laws to protect voters from deepfakes and short circuit draft bills aimed at protecting people from discrimination and landlords who use AI to raise rent prices.
“If this bill were to pass, California couldn’t protect its citizens from exactly those harms,” he said.
Companies and lobbyists are attempting to use Washington D.C. to undermine California’s legislative AI leadership, said state Sen. Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Becker has authored or coauthored a number of bills regulating AI, including one signed into law that requires AI makers provide tools to consumers so they know when generative AI is in use and another that seeks to prevent health insurance companies from unfairly using AI to deny people health care.
“If this bill were to pass, California couldn’t protect its citizens from exactly those harms.”Ben Winters, attorney for the Consumer Federation of America, on AI harms like deepfakes, discrimination and algorithmic price setting.
“This is an effort to tell people when something was created by AI, and so if this gets delayed for a year or two or 10 it’s going to have really negative consequences,” he said.
What’s unclear, he said, is exactly what regulation is covered by the moratorium. Would it, for example, wipe out privacy protections that Californians enjoy, and which were targeted by Congressional legislation last year? And how would it affect a bill Becker authored that gives people a way to quickly delete personal information collected by data brokers, set to go into effect next January?
“If they preempt that, it’s really negative for the country,” he said. “We’re [California] big enough that we can influence the country on our own, but if they preempt what we’re doing then it’s up to the federal government who has been unable to act on these issues.”
Momentum for AI harms — and, possibly, for curbs on regulation
For all the worry, the moratorium is dead on arrival if it reaches the U.S. Senate, said Gus Rossi, director of public policy and strategy at Omidyar Network, which funds public interest AI projects and tracks AI regulation. 
That’s because a federal regulation known as the Byrd rule requires that budget reconciliation bills be related to fiscal matters, and, in Rossi’s reading at least,  a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation doesn’t fit that definition. But Rossi still thinks people should take it seriously, arguing that it’s an attempt by House Republicans to establish a marker on what they think should be the approach to AI legislation, and a sign of things to come.
“The action is in the states, not D.C.,” he said. “That’s why some people in D.C. are trying to stop states.. particularly California, who’s leading the pack.”
If this bill or a similar one in the future passes, Rossi expects it would get challenged in court and put a chilling effect on efforts to regulate AI by state lawmakers.
It’s unclear whether it’s legal for the federal government to make a blanket moratorium on state regulation, said Winters, who worked in the U.S. Department of Justice during the Biden administration.
He agrees that the Byrd rule means the bill is unlikely to pass if it reaches the U.S. Senate, though Republicans may connect it to a $500 million plan to invest in AI for federal agencies and argue that it’s essential to limit state regulation in order to carry out certain budget provisions.
The House bill makes exceptions for states to continue enforcing some laws related to AI, such as laws that enable more use of AI or that are intended to improve government efficiency. It’s reasonable to interpret that exception to mean states like California could continue enforcing privacy law if this bill passed, said Amba Kak, codirector of The AI Now Institute, a research and equitable AI advocacy organization. But that’s risky.
“We can’t count on the fact that courts will see it this way, especially in the context of an otherwise sweeping moratorium with the clear intention to clamp down on AI-related enforcement,” she said.
A House AI task force spent years discussing areas of bipartisan agreement and possible bills to pass to regulate AI, New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a hearing about the moratorium, but Congress was unable to pass any of that legislation. During that time, people committed suicide from their interactions with chatbots and kids and teens were harmed by falsely generated sexually exploitative deepfakes, and so states decided to act to do things like force AI chatbots to protect the private information of people seeking mental health care in Utah and require chatbots include a protocol for when someone expresses the desire to commit self harm in New York. 
“All of these protections are protections that Congress refuses to take up, refuses, and so states are taking up this responsibility,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “Let states protect people. A moratorium is a deeply dangerous idea at this moment.”
“All of these protections are protections that Congress refuses to take up.”Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democratic congresswoman, on state AI regulations
Congresswoman Doris Matsui, a Democrat from the Sacramento area,  echoed Ocasio-Cortez at the hearing, saying,  “We can’t shoot ourselves in the foot by stopping the good work states have done and will continue to do.” 
Supporters of the moratorium identify different sorts of harm if it doesn’t pass. A patchwork of state regulations of AI “is the fastest way to secure Chinese dominance of AI,” said Jay Obernolte, a Republican from California and co-chair of the House AI task force. He supports a moratorium and preemption of state law by federal law, and if Congress fails to act, he said the people it will hurt most are entrepreneurs who can’t afford to follow regulatory regimes passed by different states.
“The most destructive thing is if there’s fear out there that every few years as the winds of political fortune shift, the rules governing the use of AI completely change,” he said during the hearing.
Broader pushback against AI regulation
The proposed moratorium is in line with efforts to prevent regulation of AI by President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance, who say such regulations will stifle innovation. A White House plan to promote growth of the AI industry and likely reduce regulation is due out by this summer. Companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and big businesses who use AI  have lobbied in Sacramento and Washington D.C. to prevent regulation of the technology. 
Guthrie’s proposal comes a few days after Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, pushed for “light touch” AI regulation to ensure the United States maintains AI supremacy over other nations and to, in Cruz’s words, “prevent needless state over-regulation.”
The intent of Guthrie’s bill, Winters believes, is to send a signal to tech companies and open up the door to possible future legislation if the budget reconciliation bill fails to pass. It’s a trend consistent with Senator Cruz’s statement last week and efforts to remove red tape for data center projects on federal land.
“I’d describe this as.. explicitly saying we are supporting the AI companies more than the American people,” he said. “We’re seeing an explicit turn toward a deregulatory state.”
Federal lawmakers have steadily increased the number of bills they propose related to AI in recent years, but they have passed relatively few of them into law, according to the AI Index report. Out of more 220 bills proposed last year, only four passed.
By contrast, state lawmakers passed more than 130 bills to regulate AI last year. California passed 22 bills last year, more than any other state, and attempted to harmonize its rules with the European Union’s AI Act and other U.S. states. The 2024 State of State Tech Policy report found a 163% increase in tech policy proposals by state lawmakers last year compared to 2023. That trend is driven by one-party control in the vast majority of state houses across the country.
The adage that states are the laboratories of democracy is still true, said ​​Scott Brennen, a coauthor of the State of State Tech Policy report, so shutting down their ability to see what they can cover and try out different approaches doesn’t seem like a good idea, and could undercut the federal government’s ability to make better policy. Since AI is getting integrated into an ever-wider range of tools and platforms, Guthrie’s moratorium appears to apply widely, he added, including to social media platforms, ongoing efforts by states to protect children online, and data privacy protections that address automated decision making.
“I don’t necessarily think state regulation of AI is always the best course of action, there are definitely areas like consumer data protection where it would be better if the federal government took the lead, but the federal government isn’t taking the lead,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051325-US-Capitol-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-16 09:07:37.508601

NEW ORLEANS – With Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” as a soundtrack, nurses at University Medical Center walked off the job for the third time, picketing along the city’s Canal Street thoroughfare earlier this month.
“We will picket, shout, bargain, petition and strike again, and again, and again until the nurses win the first contract!” Terry Mogilles, an orthopedic trauma clinic nurse, told a rapt crowd on May 1. The crowd comprised about 100 nurses and their supporters, with many of the nurses wearing scrubs or red shirts with white lettering reading “We Will Strike for Our Patients!”
Mogilles and roughly 600 University Medical Center nurses voted to unionize with National Nurses United in December 2023. They are in their 16th month of union representation but say their employer is stalling on a contract that would actually improve their jobs.
Observers say nurses may be waiting even longer. On average, health care unions go around 17 months before obtaining first contracts. Today, the nurses not only have to overcome their employer’s resistance, but the downstream effects of the Trump administration’s policy changes, too.
In November, University Medical Center Management Corporation, filed a complaintwith the National Labor Relations Board, blaming the union for delays in negotiations. Workers say it is UMC that is delaying, and LCMC, the parent corporation for UMC and one of only two hospital administrators in the city, declined Capital & Main’s request for comment.

Nurses at University Medical Center are running up against a systemic flaw facing most newly organized workers — made worse by the current presidential administration, said Margaret Poydock, senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute.
While the National Labor Relations Act mandates that employers must “bargain in good faith,” the law does not enforce a timeline on negotiations; more than half of all newly organized unions take over a year to get a contract, and the average as of 2022 was 465 days. There’s also a built-in incentive for anti-union employers to delay first contracts: One year after workers win union recognition, they can vote to dissolve their union. A long delay can enable employers to restart union-busting efforts.
“There are not really legal penalties,” said Poydock, because the National Labor Relations Board cannot fine employers for prolonging negotiations. Furthermore, said Poydock, in the case of unions who believe that their employer is not bargaining in good faith, “The only legal recourse workers have is through the board.”
However, the Trump administration has thrown the National Labor Relations Board into turmoil. One week after his inauguration, Trump fired the Joe Biden-appointed NLRB chair, Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the five-member board with just two members. The agency cannot issue decisions without a quorum of three members, giving reluctant employers even less incentive to bargain in good faith, knowing cases brought against them can be prolonged.
While Wilcox has sued for reinstatement, the case has bounced between judges and is still in litigation. If Wilcox loses her case, the board may remain without a quorum; if Wilcox wins reinstatement, Trump can appoint two more members to the board, creating a conservative majority. “That might make workers more hesitant to bring cases to the board, because they potentially will not have a ruling that favors them,” said Poydock.
President Trump also signed an executive order gutting the Federal Mediation & Conciliation Service (FMCS), cutting its staff from 220 to about a dozen and “eliminating [the FMCS and six other agencies] to the minimum presence and functionrequired by law.” The service helped workers and companies reach contract agreements. Though National Nurses United did not comment on whether it planned to seek FMCS involvement, without protections from the National Labor Relations Board or support from FMCS, unions like the one at University Medical Center have fewer options — outside of strikes — to force their employers to negotiate with them.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
New Orleans nurses say they walked out because workplace conditions have failed to improve.
The union has struck twice before, in October 2024 and February. Both times, management locked them out, costing LCMC a reported $2 million per day, or a total of $16 million.
In the months since, nurses say workplace violence has continued, pay is not sufficient, and University Medical Center has moved too slowly on contract negotiations.
“We had a number of nurses that were hurt on the job by patients; the potential for danger went up instead of going down,” said Mogilles. Nurses also say there have been several instances in which guns have been found in the hospital, and that chronic understaffing has continued, endangering patients and nurses alike.
Negotiations over pay have also contributed to the strike. Nurses say University Medical Center officials took eight months to respond to a seven-page wage proposal nurses had submitted last July. The hospital response, they say, was one paragraph long.
Umer Mukhtar, an ICU nurse and bargaining team member, said that the hospital’s delayed response “was a very strong motivation for us to come out and picket again.”
Mukhtar said retention at the hospital is poor, noting that eight nurses left his ICU in the past month.
“They [LCMC Health] want to keep [telling] lies while they buy time to union-bust and hopefully — for them — decertify the union,” he said. “They’re trying to make [the majority of nurses think that] the union is not an effective bargaining tool.”
On Canal Street’s rain-washed stage, Mogilles earned riotous applause as she closed out her speech. “Asking politely does not work!,” she said. “LCMC, you not like us! And we’re so glad we not like you.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Permitting reviews for major mining projects may take years to complete, usually gathering input from the community and vital information on the natural and cultural characteristics of the sites. However, the Trump administration announced on Monday that, under newly established emergency procedures, a uranium mining project in Utah would have a completion timeline of just 14 days. 
After a portion of it was already mined, the Velvet-Wood mine located in San Juan County is set to be reopened by Anfield Energy, a Canadian energy development company, according to an economic analysis of the project. The project is expected to yield significant results, since the Velvet mine has already produced 400,000 tons of ore containing 4.2 million pounds of uranium, often used as fuel at nuclear power plants, and 4.8 million pounds of vanadium, which is used in steel production and energy storage. 
But, environmental advocates worry that accelerating the approval process for this project would set a dangerous precedent for the country and may cause harm to the already scarce water resources in the area.

“These processes, which are enshrined under one of our bedrock environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act, are really fundamental to being able to do an objective, well-thought out assessment of what the potential harms of a project like this might be,” Lexi Tuddenham, executive director of the environmental nonprofit HEAL Utah, said. “And they also, under the normal process, give the opportunity for public comment.”
The project sits in a Utah area that has seen the boom and bust of uranium mining over time, leaving abandoned mines without any cleanup plans, Tuddenham said. It is also near the Navajo Nation, which has been affected by uranium mining and processing throughout history. In such a rushed process, it would be extremely difficult to consider public comments from tribes.



Let us know what you think...


 


By shortening the process to just two weeks, there’s essentially not an opportunity for the people who may know the landscape best to provide important information on the site’s characteristics.
“One of the things being said about this mine is that it would only require about three acres of surface disturbance, but that’s not accounting for the underground disturbance that happens as part of the mining process,” Tuddenham said. “There’s really complex hydrology, like aquifers and just different water tables throughout our landscape, and when you mine into them, sometimes you permanently alter them.”
An energy emergency order
When the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the permitting review would be expedited to 14 days, it cited the national energy emergency declared by President Donald Trump on his first day in office. 
“America is facing an alarming energy emergency because of the prior administration’s Climate Extremist policies. President Trump and his administration are responding with speed and strength to solve this crisis,” Doug Burgum, secretary of the Interior, said in a statement in a news release. “The expedited mining project review represents exactly the kind of decisive action we need to secure our energy future.”  
The department added in the release that the U.S. “is dangerously reliant on foreign imports to meet its demand” to fuel nuclear reactors.
However, at the same time, a court battle is ongoing over the Trump order that allowed the process to be fast-tracked. Fifteen blue states are suing the federal government for issuing an energy emergency declaration without an actual emergency. 
“The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” attorneys general for the states wrote in the suit.
While Tuddenham believes there may be ways to make it easier for the public to engage in the process, expediting the years-long timelines, making substantial mistakes at the beginning of the permitting analysis would make wait times even longer and put a bigger burden on taxpayers.
“If you really skip around and skip around this bedrock environmental law and try to basically do it wrong, you’re, quite frankly, opening yourself up to a lot more litigation and red tape,” she said. “So going faster at the start doesn’t mean going faster overall.

A bill that would have changed the governance of the department did not pass before the Legislature adjourned on Wednesday. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would have subjected the Alabama Department of Archives and History’s Board of Trustees to political appointments failed to become law in another legislative session.
SB 5, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliot, R-Josephine, would have taken the board’s power to nominate its own members and made the governor the appointing authority for most seats, including members from each congressional district. Eight at-large appointments would havecome from the House Speaker, Senate President Pro Tempore, and the House and Senate Minority Leaders.
This year’s effort was the furthest his bill has moved. Elliott said that he planned on bringing it back next year.
“I think at the end, everybody was on the same page … just ran out of time. It happens,” Elliot said after the Senate adjourned its final day Wednesday, adding that “it’s certainly a starting point for next year, and we’ll come back with it.”
Elliott has pushed for similar legislation since a presentation about LGBTQ+ history in Alabama at Archives in June 2023 led to attacks from Republicans and right-wing groups.Elliott tried to pull $5 million from the department in a special session on redistricting in the summer of 2023, but the bill failed to pass.
The following year, Ellitt filed a  bill that would have allowed state officials and legislative leaders to handpick the board members, keeping the board’s size as it was. That bill made it through the Senate and a House committee, but it never got to a vote in the full House.
The bill this year faced some delay after it returned to the upper chamber after the House added an amendment to remove the Senate confirmation process from appointments by the Speaker of the House.
Sen. Robert Stewart, D-Selma, asked Elliot how he felt about eliminating the Senate confirmation process, saying that this would make the Department of Archives and History one of the few agencies not subject to Senate oversight via confirmations.
Elliot, ignoring the debate while using his phone on the podium, did not look up.
“Well, I guess it’s not his pleasure,” Stewart said.
Elliot asked the Senate to adopt the House amendment, which would have sent the bill to the governor, but Senate Democrats continued to filibuster, effectively delaying and later killing some local bills. Elliott eventually changed his mind and asked the Senate to nonconcur, sending the bill to negotiations between the House and Senate through a conference committee.
The conference committee met shortly before the Senate convened Wednesday and removed the amendment added in the House, bringing the bill back to the Senate version. But amid a filibuster from Senate Democrats, neither chamber took up the conference committee report before the Legislature adjourned for the year.

Archives meeting

Archives’ board of trustees met on Wednesday afternoon.
“Whatever happens, we are very committed to working with the new appointments to be sure that we continue to serve the state well, and that there may well be some benefits of having those kinds of direct connections with the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House through their respective appointments,” Steve Murray, the director of Archives and History, said.
He then expressed gratitude to the members who would have been replaced under the legislation.
“I also want to thank the staff who have maintained really an unbreakable spirit of service and continuity in our work,” he said. “It has not been an easy couple of years for us here, but they remain absolutely committed to the work that we are doing, and do it with such energy and knowledge, and enthusiasm, and professionalism, that I could not be prouder to be affiliated with them.”
After the 90-minute meeting, Delores R. Boyd, chair of the Board for Archives said the changes that was under consideration by the Legislature were unnecessary.
“The governance structure that has worked for years was adequate,” Boyd said. “I respect the judgement of the politicians who believe that ought to have more impact. I hope that their motivation though, is one that is destined to keep this important agency on the same trajectory, that is: we are the crown jewel of state archival and history agencies. We have functioned well for over a century.”

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager is proposing the state tap into the Rainy Day Fund to provide additional pay for public school district teachers in hard-to-fill positions, citing the success similar funding provided two years ago had on the Clark County School District.
The Las Vegas Democrat is also proposing a mechanism to provide charter schools with dedicated funding for broader teacher and support staff raises, making good on a commitment to try and extend to them what they were denied by the Legislature two years ago.
The policy proposal to provide an additional $5,000 per year in pay for district teachers at low-income schools and in critical areas was well received by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee during a hearing Thursday. As was the proposal to establish a mechanism for broader teacher and support staff raises at charter schools.
But the proposed funding mechanism included within the bill — taking $90 million out of the state’s fully funded $1.3 billion Rainy Day Fund — may be a sticking point.
Yeager acknowledged it’s “a serious request” that will raise concern and discontent.
“I do think it’s accurate to say that it is already rainy and has been raining when it comes to filling hard-to-fill positions,” he continued. “If we’re being honest with ourselves, things are only likely to get worse when it comes to education and education funding given what’s happening at the federal level at the moment. So, I believe this is a good use of the funds.”
Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who chairs the Ways and Means Committee, in the meeting said she was “not in agreement” with the funding component of Yeager’s bill but said she would work to find an appropriate source of funding.
“I don’t think we have an answer for that today,” she added.
Monroe-Moreno, who is also chair of the Nevada State Democratic Party, did not elaborate, but Democrats this entire legislative session have warned that an economic downturn and budget cuts at the federal level may force the state to tap the Rainy Day Fund in order to maintain important services.
Yeager’s proposal, Assembly Bill 398, would provide up to $90 million in differential pay across two years for public school district teachers in positions deemed hard to fill. To qualify for the differential pay, teachers would have to work at a Title-1 school with a high vacancy rate, defined as 10% at the elementary level, 12% at the middle school level, and 15% at the high school level. Or they would have to work in an area that has been deemed to have a “critical labor shortage” — English language arts, math, science, or special education.
The Clark County Education Association and CCSD dedicated similar differential pay using an infusion of funding approved by the 2023 Legislature. According to Clark County Education Association Executive Director John Vellardita, who presented the bill alongside Yeager, the results were a resounding success.
Vellardita said Title-1 schools that qualified for the differential pay in 2023 saw a 53% reduction in vacancies, from 1,346 vacancies in May 2024 to 633 in January 2025. Special education positions saw an 84% reduction, from 310 vacancies in August 2024 to 50 in March 2025.
That progress toward getting a qualified teacher in every classroom needs sustained investments, he added. “It has made a difference. We’re asking for this to continue.”
CCEA Vice President Matt Nighswonger said during support testimony that the additional funding helps with teacher retention by incentivizing them to stay in positions that need the most experienced teachers.
“Teachers often view these positions as a stepping stone to a different school or a one-year teaching assignment to demonstrate they are a quality teacher,” he said. “Once they have demonstrated their prowess, they move on to a school in the suburban ring or to subjects that are not as demanding to teach.”
AB398 funding for educators would be available for all 17 Nevada school districts. But Yeager acknowledged that charter school teachers and education support professionals at both charter and district schools would not be eligible for the hard-to-fill position pay.
“Were our financial situation better, I might have made a different decision,” he said. “A future legislature can always decide to include them, but I didn’t believe it would be fiscally responsible for me to include them now. I don’t want to spread the funding too thin so that it doesn’t work and achieve the objective of actually filling these hard-to-fill positions.”
The Nevada State Education Association, whose affiliate units include teachers in non-Clark counties and support staff in CCSD, opposes the bill on the grounds it excludes education support personnel who are just as hands-on and vital to student success. Teamsters Local 14, which represents bus drivers and some other support staff within CCSD, similarly opposed the bill.
The Charter School Association of Nevada, Nevada Association of School Boards and Nevada Association of School Superintendents, as well as Clark and Washoe school districts, support the legislation.
Support from the charter school community was due to a conceptual amendment establishing a statewide fund that charter schools could tap to help with raises for their teachers and support staff. Yeager said the idea is to create a system similar to 2023’s Senate Bill 231, which provided $250 million in funding for teachers and support staff at public school districts.
The budget committee last week approved an education budget that makes permanent those SB231 raises.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s recommended budget had charter school raises being similarly baked into the education budget, but Democrats rejected that recommendation, saying charter school raises needed to be handled separately. That prompted Lombardo to publicly threaten to veto the education budget.
“I’ve been clear and consistent on this,” Lombardo said in a statement issued last week. “I will not sign an education budget that does not include equal pay for public charter school teachers and make teacher pay raises, including those for charter school teachers, permanent.”
Yeager’s AB398  provides a possible solution to charter school raises. Charter schools, likely collectively through their authorizing agency, the Nevada State Public Charter School Authority, would have to request the funds from the Interim Finance Committee, which makes financial decisions when the legislature is not in session. The schools would also have to match the funding, a requirement of 2023’s SB 231.
The governor’s office did not respond to the Nevada Current’s request for comment on Yeager’s proposal and whether it satisfies his requirement for equal pay for charter school teachers.
The current legislative session must end on June 2, leaving less than three weeks for lawmakers to pass a balanced budget that the governor will sign. In 2023, legislators failed to do so, which forced a 1-day special session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SteveYeager-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-16 08:03:48.435728

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)On Monday, the Trump administration announced that it is canceling permission for about 9,000 Afghanistan refugees to remain in the United States, including some who aided America’s war effort in Afghanistan.
The move came eight days after the Alaska House of Representatives voted unanimously to approve a resolution that asks the administration to resume evacuation flights from that country. The state Senate is considering that resolution as well.
House Joint Resolution 13, from Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, asks federal officials “to resume processing stalled applications by Afghan allies” and to reinstate evacuation flights “for applicants with approved special immigrant visas and their families, including efforts to overcome logistical barriers and diplomatic negotiations.”
The resolution doesn’t address the Trump administration’s actions; the resolution was developed before those were announced.  
Speaking on the House floor, Stapp said he served two tours of duty in the Iraq War and saw the bravery of local interpreters and police officers who worked with members of the American military despite threats to their lives.
“This resolution requests that our federal partners expedite special immigration visas so that we can look to bring as many of those people who stood shoulder to shoulder with us during our time at war to the United States so we can fulfill the promises that we made to them before they too suffer the same fate … that so many have already suffered,” he said.
HJR 13 is in the Senate State Affairs Committee and becomes final only if approved by the Senate and the House.

Twenty Black families from South Carolina filed a lawsuit, Briggs v. Elliott, the first direct attack on the validity of the “separate but equal” doctrine in public schools. 
The litigation was later combined with the successful Brown v. Board of Education case. The litigation might never have happened if not for the Rev. Joseph A. DeLaine, who accepted the NAACP’s call to challenge the school bus transportation practices in Clarendon County, where Black students had to walk up to 8 miles to school. 
“I realize that the stand that I take may cost me my job as a school teacher, but we need men,” he wrote. 
Property owner Levi Pearson had previously sued, asking that school buses be provided for Black students. After his lawsuit failed on technical grounds, Thurgood Marshall approached DeLaine, saying he needed families for litigation, or the NAACP couldn’t go any further. 
After gathering the signatures of 107 parents and their children, economic pressure and violence followed. Despite this, 17 adults signed the petition again, and the lawsuit moved forward to trial. Evidence showed that South Carolina spent $221 annually for each white student, but only $45 for each Black student. White children had modern schools with a teacher for every grade. Meanwhile, Black children studied in wooden shacks, reading textbooks discarded by white students. 
As a result of their activism, the Pearson family saw boycotts of their timber, and the Briggses were fired from their jobs. So were DeLaine and his wife. They saw their home and church burned to the ground. They were forced to leave the state after a drive-by shooting.

Birmingham officials have filed a lawsuit against a new state law that would reduce the number of appointments from the city to the Birmingham Water Works Board. (John Coletti/The Image Bank)The Alabama Legislature’s 2025 session is over, and the lawsuits have begun.
After state lawmakers passed a bill reducing Birmingham’s appointments to the Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB), Birmingham officials filed a federal lawsuit to try to protect their controlling interest in the utility.
The city government currently appoints six of the nine directors on the board; SB 330, sponsored by Sen. Dan Roberts, R-Mountain Brook, converts BWWB into a regional authority with seven members and a single appointment from the city.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A hearing on the lawsuit, filed before Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bill on May 7, was scheduled for Thursday but postponed. The law does not explicitly mention BWWB but its provisions reflect the make-up of the water utility. Currently, two directors are appointed by the mayor while the Birmingham City Council appoints four members.
A message was left with Gov. Kay Ivey’s office Thursday seeking comment.
Proponents of the legislation said it was necessary to impose changes. In the past, the water utility has been beset with issues with billing, oversight and concerns over public trust. Customers reported concerns with unread meters and inaccurate water bills.
Under Roberts’ bill, the governor, lieutenant governor and counties that own a major reservoir would each get an appointment. Birmingham’s mayor and the president of the Jefferson County Commission also get an appointment. The governor’s appointment must come from one of the counties served by the utility.
Another county located outside the area where the utility is based gets to also appoint a board member. The governing body of the municipality where the regional water utility is located appoints a director. Finally, that law states that a resident where the water utility is located may also be a member of the Board.
The remaining members are selected, respectively, by the Jefferson County Mayors Association, the Shelby County Commission and Blount County Commission.
The lawsuit alleges the bill the equal rights and due process protections in the U.S. and Alabama constitutions. The lawsuit says that lawmakers in the Legislature, most of whom are white, reduced the power of officials in Birmingham whose population is 67% Black and forms 41% of the utility’s customer base.
The lawsuit also notes that other areas with representation are mostly white. In Blount County, it says, only about 2% of the residents are Black, and in Walker County, only 6% are Black.
“SB330 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution,” the lawsuit states.
Plaintiffs listed in the lawsuit also stated that the law violates their right to due process because any changes to the board require changes to the Certificate of Incorporation, which is not part of the legislation, that must be approved by Birmingham City Council. The law changes the Certificate of Incorporation by reducing the number of members that the city council may appoint, which members of the Council did not approve.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Stacey Pape: Proposed federal budgets cuts put public libraries under threat.","Dear Editor,On behalf of the South Burlington Public Library board of trustees, we express our deep concern about proposed federal budget cuts that threaten the future of public libraries here in Vermont.In South Burlington, we have a beautiful, welcoming public library because of the tireless support of our citizens. The library prides itself on strengthening our community through abundant resources. For example, our residents have access to materials from libraries throughout the state and beyond through interlibrary loan. We also offer the ABLE library (audio, braille, large print and electronic books) at no cost to patrons of all ages who are blind, visually impaired or have reading disabilities.And residents only need a library card to find online instruction and information on a huge range of topics, like car repair, test prep, nutrition, coding, starting a business and how to talk to others who hold opposing viewpoints. These essential services support education, employment and community well-being. However, these services are now under threat. The president’s executive order issued on March 14 proposes drastic cuts to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the agency that provides crucial federal funding for libraries across the country. If implemented, this order would cripple the ability of our library — and all of Vermont’s libraries — to serve our residents.The Vermont Department of Libraries stands to lose roughly one-third of its funding if these cuts are made. All but two full-time employees of the Vermont Department of Libraries receive federal funds for their salaries. Without qualified staff to run the programs, many resources, such as the ILL and ABLE, will be inaccessible. Support, training and certification from the VDOL for Vermont library staff may also disappear.These services enable South Burlington residents to access information and materials far beyond the reach of a single public library. ILL is the most effective and efficient use of federal funds because it extends lending possibilities.Without the statewide ABLE Library, the South Burlington Public Library cannot provide full library access to local residents with disabilities. And removing access to Gale Research may leave residents without these plentiful online resources, both during and after library hours.These losses to our state libraries are not inevitable. Please urge Vermont’s congressional delegation to reject any budget that includes cuts to IMLS or otherwise undermines the critical mission of our nation’s libraries.Keep up with the issues facing libraries at the American Library Association’s website and sign up for news updates at Every Library. Protecting federal library funding is not just a matter of budget priorities. It is a commitment to the democratic values of access, opportunity and knowledge for all.Thank you for supporting your local library.Sincerely,Stacey Pape, chair of the South Burlington Public Library board of trustees, On behalf of the South Burlington Public Library board of trusteesRead the story on VTDigger here:  Stacey Pape: Proposed federal budgets cuts put public libraries under threat.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letters-to-the-editor_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

Each tribe has their own history — their own story — and each has the right to pursue its own future.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peter A. Thomas: An alternative perspective on the Vermont Abenaki.","This commentary is by Peter A. Thomas. He is a retired UVM research associate professor. The text is adapted from his presentation to an information program for Vermont legislators about the state-recognized Abenaki communities on April 4, 2025.In 1978, while directing the consulting archaeology program at UVM, I received a contract from the National Park Service to do an archaeological survey in the Missisquoi Wildlife Refuge in Swanton. Along the north bank of the river, where Robertson’s Lease of 1765 established seven Abenaki farmsteads, we recovered ceramic and stone artifacts for 1.5 miles, confirming that this same area had been a focus of Native settlement for several thousand years.This project began a quarter-century of dialogue with the Abenaki community at Missisquoi. I worked with them to address the reburial of human remains. Young members of the community worked alongside my field team in Highgate where we were excavating Native sites spanning thousands of years. Everyone I met was open, enthusiastic, respectful and proud to be engaged. They were certainly not self-obsessed and self-serving “wannabes.” These folks directed their efforts towards the welfare of their family, extended families and community.The emergence and revitalization of the Missisquoi and other Abenaki bands in Vermont that I had observed was not unique. This upwelling of tribal activity was sparked by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and ‘70s in which marginalized and disadvantaged communities throughout the country stood up and demanded recognition, respect and civil justice.READ MORE
The Narraganset, Mohegan, Pequot, Mashpee, Nipmuc and Stockbridge also made their presence known at this time. Some received federal recognition; others did not. They are all still here. In 2012, I was asked by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs to review the documentation which the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi, St. Francis/Sokoki Band had submitted with its request for state recognition. Contrary to recent accusations in the press, I was not paid to do so.Criterion 6 of the Legislature’s nine conditions for state recognition asked how the tribe would “address the social, economic, political or cultural needs of its members with ongoing educational programs and activities.” The listed accomplishments demonstrated the enormous commitment of time and initiatives of the Abenaki Tribal Council, Abenaki Self-Help Association and the Abenaki community at large to improve the condition of its people.In 1976 there were enormous obstacles to community betterment. According to documents submitted as part of the recognition process by the Missisquoi, in 1976 nearly 40% of the Missisquoi families had no income from employment; 66% of the heads of households had neither a high school diploma nor GED; health and housing conditions were alarming. These challenges were met by developing an affordable housing project, expanding basic literacy, and preventing school dropouts.Also from the documents the Missisquoi submitted: Looking back some 35 years, the Abenaki drop-out rate at Missisquoi Valley Union High School was 70% with 50% leaving school before ninth grade. In 2012, the drop-out rate was 3% and conversational Abenaki was being taught at the local high school.In 1982, fewer than 5% of the Abenaki who graduated received any post-secondary education. By 2009, 40% of Abenaki high school graduates went on to college; several were pursuing advanced degrees. In 1980, the Federal Commissioner of Administration for Native Affairs identified the Abenaki Self Help Association as one of the 12 outstanding Native social service agencies in the country. This is not a record that any group of “pretendians” could have ever achieved.A parallel revival also seems to have occurred at Odanak. Gordon Day, when working for the Museum of Man in Canada to record Native Abenaki speakers, made these early observations in 1956:“Superficially this band appeared to be almost totally acculturated. Their houses and clothes were Euro-Canadian. They had had the attention of Christian missionaries for 300 years; They had not hunted and trapped for a living since about 1922; Certain elders did remember Abenaki traditions, which as children they had heard from grandparents who were born in the early 19th century … The one native trait which was apparent was the language, which was then spoken as the language of choice by about 60 of the elder generation. By 1968, Gordon could count only 22 Abenaki speakers.”Like all of the Vermont Abenaki tribes, Odanak worked to revitalize their history and Native culture. Each tribe has their own history — their own story — and each has the right to pursue its own future. I am deeply saddened by all the vitriolic clamor that has been going on in the press. Regardless of Odanak’s current agenda, when Missisquoi petitioned for state recognition in 2012, the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Narraganset, Wampanoag (Aquinnah), Mohegan and Haudenosaunee all sent letters of support. The refrain that I’ve heard from tribes across the U.S. — “We know who we are!” — should not be ignored. I thought that we as Vermonters were long past the days when our fourth-grade Vermont history books informed us that “Indians never lived in Vermont.” Do we want to be troubled again with such a stamp of ignorance and regressive policies?

They’re all trying to convince Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson that there are problems with the tax bills on his desk, and they are suggesting vetoes as a fix. Not surprisingly, they say the provisions drawing their antipathy will cost them, and by extension their customers, more money.
Ferguson has received written requests from hundreds of people and groups hoping to influence him ahead of Tuesday, the deadline to make decisions on pending bills.
He can sign or veto them entirely. He could veto a part, then sign what’s left into law. If the governor fails to act on a bill by the deadline, it would become law without his signature.
Whether he’ll wield the veto pen with such force as to require summoning the Legislature into special session is unknown. Rejecting the entire operating budget certainly would.
Ferguson could be tactical and veto a prong in a tax bill that the next two-year budget is not dependent on, for example. Lawmakers could make any course corrections next session. 
“Each day, we make some decisions and delay others,” Ferguson said Wednesday. “Some are a little more complicated, so we’ll keep talking.”
Here’s a glance at some of the folks trying to bend Ferguson’s ear their way.
The big one
House Bill 2081 is the most far-reaching of tax bills pushed through by majority Democrats over Republican opposition. It’s got five parts that are projected to generate $2.1 billion in the next budget and $5.6 billion over four years.
It has an across-the-board boost in business taxes, temporary surcharge on high-grossing firms and higher tax rates on large financial institutions and computing giants.
A number of companies and organizations are pressing Ferguson to remove the three-year surcharge for companies grossing more than $250 million. Among them are the Washington Hospitality Association and Washington Food Industry Association, who say it will drive up costs of food sold in restaurants and by independent grocers.
The Associated General Contractors want the whole bill vetoed. In its letter, the organization said the business tax increase will result in higher bids, driving up the cost of housing, schools, roads, and bridges.
“This could lead to delayed or canceled projects, job losses, and ultimately reduced state revenues,” executives with the group wrote
Sales tax on services
Senate Bill 5814, the other major money-maker, is relied on to raise $1.1 billion for the next budget, mostly by applying the retail sales tax to more services, such as digital advertising and temporary staffing. 
A coalition of streaming services, including Netflix, Paramount+, Peacock, and the Walt Disney Co., argues the new ad tax will lead to higher costs for customers or fewer options if services leave the market. They also think it may be challenged in court.
“Singling out one segment of the ad economy for this kind of discriminatory treatment is the wrong way to address the state’s fiscal needs and would do far more harm than good,” the Streaming Innovation Alliance told the governor.
The American Staffing Association wants Ferguson to pull temporary staffing services from the bill. Nearly 266,000 residents were employed through temporary or contract positions in 2023, it said.
“A sales tax on staffing services effectively raises the cost of labor, which research shows will lead to reduced demand for temporary work,” wrote Toby Malara, the association’s vice president of government relations. 
There is also a provision to begin taxing certain products with nicotine, like Zyn pouches, on Jan. 1, 2026.
PMI US Corporate Services, better known as Philip Morris International, wants it removed. “This would be the highest tax rate on nicotine pouches in the nation, and more importantly, would tax nicotine pouches at a higher rate than combustible cigarettes,” the company noted in its letter.
Ending tax breaks
Senate Bill 5794 aims to bring in $148.5 million by getting rid of tax breaks enjoyed by around 4,000 taxpayers. Ferguson is hearing from those who don’t want to lose the perks.
Operators of self-service storage facilities are one group. They would begin to pay taxes on the renting or leasing of individual units. They contend it’s not legal and urge Ferguson to view such a tax with skepticism as he did the now-discarded wealth tax. They attached an analysis from attorney Philip Talmadge, a former state Supreme Court justice, to drive home their point.
“Self-storage is not a luxury — it is a lifeline for thousands of working- and middle-class Washingtonians. Taxing it under a constitutionally dubious statute will only raise costs and undermine the integrity of our state’s tax system, while inviting a lawsuit the State will struggle to defend,” wrote Lance Baker, president of the Washington Self Storage Association.  
Community banks are pleading to preserve a deduction for first mortgage interest income. Eliminating it will increase their taxes and they say those costs will get passed on.
“Your administration has consistently emphasized the urgent need to expand housing supply and make homeownership more accessible,” wrote Jolene Riggs, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Baker Boyer National Bank in Walla Walla. “This added expense will force lenders to increase interest rates and fees, or reduce lending, making homeownership less attainable for the very families you seek to support.”
Taxing Tesla
House Bill 2077 would begin taxing the sale of electric vehicle credits between automakers. This has been dubbed the “Tesla tax” because the firm led by Elon Musk is the only automaker with credits to sell in Washington. Tesla opposes it, saying it will slow Washington’s push to sell more electric vehicles.
“Governments don’t tax or penalize overcompliance because it’s contradictory to the stated program goals,” Tesla executive Noelani Derrickson wrote, adding “it sets up a bizarre and unprecedented taxing scheme.”
Ford Motor Co., Rivian Automotive, and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation also want brakes applied to the new tax, which is counted on to generate $54.5 million for the operating budget.
Road revenue
Senate Bill 5801 is the $3.2 billion transportation revenue package. The marquee item is a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax. There’s lots more in it, like a bump up in the cost of vehicle weight fees and fees for getting rid of old tires. 
Another component increases the state tax on diesel by 3 cents in July and another 3 cents in 2027. The Washington Trucking Association asked this to be crossed out.
Most requests concerning this bill were from opponents of a new 10% “luxury aircraft tax.” It would apply to non-commercial planes and be levied on the portion of the selling price above $500,000.
In a joint letter, the Washington State Aviation Alliance and seven other groups told Ferguson that assuming that “because aircraft are expensive and therefore ‘a luxury item’ reflects a grossly uninformed understanding” of how non-commercial aircraft are used in communities. 
They are “tools that provide essential services for people of ALL classes, not just the wealthy,” reads the April 28 letter.
Rhys Spoor, a pilot and president of the Stuart Island Airway Park Association in Friday Harbor, was more blunt in summing up his argument. 
“You already have enough in taxes and should be required as a public servant to live within a frugal budget, just like most of the rest of us have to do,” he wrote.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0821-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

(Getty Images)Members of the Commission for Higher Education met in Hammond on Thursday for several hours to detail new laws and review the changing landscape for higher education institutions, notably slimmed-down budgets, more state oversight and shifting criteria for certain scholarships. 
Like most portions of the two-year budget, state funding for higher education took a 5% hit in the final days, triggered by a grim forecast that predicted $2 billion less in revenues over the next biennium. 
Two scholarship programs stayed flat, which Brooke Kile described as a “huge win” for commissioners. Both the 21st Century Scholars program and the Frank O’Bannon Grants aim to make college more accessible for Hoosier students.

“It’s a win for higher education; it’s a win for Hoosier businesses that need talent,” said Kile, CHE’s senior associate commissioner for business solutions. 
However, unused dollars allocated to the Frank O’Bannon fund can now revert back to the general fund, a change from previous years. CHE will be permitted to transfer that money to other programs. 
“What we were spending was … $130 million a year out of a roughly $168 million appropriation. With this new ability that we received starting the next fiscal year, we are allowed to spend up to the full appropriation,” said Chris Lowery, the state’s commissioner for higher education. “That is significant, additional help for low-income students.”
In addition to the 5% reduction for some other scholarship programs, CHE’s budget line and individual allocations to each public institution were reduced along with restoration and rehabilitation funding. 
Also tucked into the budget was language abolishing the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet, an initiative touted by former Gov. Eric Holcomb. Instead, the higher education body will take up many of those duties and align the state’s educational goals with business needs.
 Other legislative impacts

Though the state’s educational institutions will be exempt from new contracting rules advanced as part of an accountability and transparency measure, CHE itself will have to operate under the requirements for documenting bids and federal funding. 
Under a separate law, CHE will also be required to submit a report examining the utilization of physical facilities at state educational institutions, including an analysis of classroom spaces, laboratories and more. 
One of the biggest changes to the operation of the state’s public institutions will be enhanced tenure reviews tied to “productivity.” Such scrutiny will include teaching loads, time spent on instruction and graduate student oversight, and the research produced by a faculty member. 
State law now requires that if these criteria are not met, the faculty member “shall” be placed on probation and could be dismissed. Additionally, professors must publicly post their syllabi.

Schools will no longer be required to have diversity committees under Senate Enrolled Act 289, which also impacts certain scholarships geared toward supporting minority students. In an attempt to still reach those students, the legislation defined “underserved counties” to include Allen, Lake, Marion, St. Joseph and Vanderburgh. Certain students from those counties may still qualify for the minority scholarships. 
Another new higher education law will require several state agencies to collaborate and create a public dashboard detailing secondary programs, such as career and technical education and adult high schools. Such reports must include information related to participation, costs, completion and employment outcomes for students. 
As the author of Senate Enrolled Act 448, Terre Haute Republican Sen. Greg Goode highlighted the measure as one with bipartisan support during the 2025 session before the commission on Thursday. He described it as an effort to help universities focus on training the workforce for high-demand priorities such as life sciences, microelectronics, semiconductors and more. 
“This is a way to help encourage and inspire department chairs, from my perspective, to grow our enrollment,” said Goode, who previously worked at Indiana State University. 
The bill would also study whether the state should have minimum admission requirements for Hoosier students.
 


				Under state law, the commission must also publish its recommendations for tuition and fee increases across the schools it oversees within 30 days after the state budget is enacted. While CHE always recommends a 0% floor increase, the maximum hit a high of 4.7% in 2009 during the great recession.
Following the recommendation of Gov. Mike Braun, commissioners have opted to direct schools to keep tuition and fees flat for the next fiscal year. 
“I know that’s a real challenge for our institutions, and I’m very sensitive to that. But I think the most important thing is what we’ve been striving for through our whole agenda: increasing enrollment and getting more Hoosier students to go to college.”

(Getty Images)Federal lawmakers are considering funding $1,000 savings accounts for children and a $5,000 baby bonus to combat falling birth rates. But I think it’s a much larger discussion than one-time payments that won’t even cover the cost of diapers.
I must start this conversation by being clear that I have never given birth. I was lucky enough to find a man with an amazing daughter, and she welcomed me as a mother. Before I met her, I never had the maternal urge or instinct.
Rather than attacking women who have a different vision for their lives, I want to focus on how to support those who want to be parents — whether of one child or many siblings.
I have experience with both, in a way. My parents both came from large families: eight and 10 siblings. Our family gatherings are epic. But I only had one sibling, a brother I lost too soon.

The U.S. birth rate has been in decline since 2007. Other countries are seeing the same phenomenon. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks two birth rates: crude birth and fertility.
Crude is the number of children born per 1,000 people. The number is calculated by dividing births in a year by the average population for the year.
Fertility rates are calculated by the total number of births to women aged 15-44.
USA Today reported in January that the crude birth rate for the U.S. in 2023 was 10.74 births per 1,000 people. The fertility rate that same year was 54.5 births per 1,000 women aged 15-44, a slight drop compared to 2022’s rate of 56 births per 1,000 such women.
In comparison, the fertility rate was 69.5 in 2007.
Vice President J.D. Vance and others are concerned about the stability of the economy due to the falling birth rates. Labor shortages are a prime consideration, as well as reduced tax revenue to support public infrastructure and services.
While a lower population could reduce consumption to a point, a baseline of service will always be needed, some argue.
There does seem to be an increased focus on career than family in recent decades. But even those who want to have children find themselves putting it off because they simply can’t afford it. It’s that group of people that government could support, in order to encourage and incentivize births.
Solutions
Child care costs are the number one concern for most. At this point, a year of child care costs as much as college tuition.
Having a parent stay home is an option, but in the current economy it would be a struggle to keep up with a family’s needs on one salary. Here in Indiana, legislators reduced eligibility for a child care voucher and also have shown no interest in a child care tax credit. They have instead focused on child care regulations that might be limiting the number of seats available in the state. While helpful, it’s doubtful the tweaks will make a significant dent in the shortage.
Let’s also remember that child care also helps employers fill open jobs.
Indiana has had a prekindergarten program since 2015 but it serves only 6,000 children statewide — and funding has stagnated.
Prekindergarten not only helps parents struggling with care options but also gives children a solid foundation for school. A longitudinal Indiana study found positive effects as a general measure of school readiness and early language and literacy. Additionally, children who participated had significantly higher mathematics and meaningfully higher English language arts scores on Indiana’s statewide assessment in the third and fourth grades than the comparison students.
Then there’s the issue of paid maternal leave. Mandating coverage would go a long way to ensuring new mothers could bond with their children and come back to careers they value. More than a dozen states have paid leave laws but Indiana is not one of them.
Family-friendly quality of life measures are also important, including a variety of parks, trails, and affordable housing. No one wants to cram multiple children into a bedroom together, and current housing prices are helping dictate family decisions.
I think the billions being discussed on the federal level — and millions in state-level decisions — would be better used in a targeted manner to grow the infrastructure needed to have and nurture children. Let’s hope the discussion continues beyond one-time payments.

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer.The recent double felony conviction of Minnesota painting contractor Fred Newell should send a clear message: Wage theft is a crime, and when workers come together through a union, justice is not just possible, it’s within reach.
Newell, owner of Integrated Painting Solutions, was entrusted with public funds for a publicly funded project. Instead of paying his workers what they were rightfully owed, he kept money for himself. He filed false payroll reports. He misclassified employees to skirt labor laws. He lied and told workers that prevailing wage standards didn’t apply to them. When workers spoke up, he said he’d pay them back. He never did.
Let’s be clear: this wasn’t a misunderstanding, it was intentional theft — plain and simple. And it’s far from an isolated incident.
As we know, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. This conviction could be a sign that wage theft is happening in our cities, on our job sites, and on the very projects meant to benefit our communities more than we think. 
As union members, we see wage theft for what it is: a systemic exploitation of working people, particularly those who are the most vulnerable — workers who can’t afford to lose a paycheck, workers who fear retaliation, and workers who are told to “take it or leave it.”
This is why unions like ours exist. We are the first line of defense. When a worker is being cheated, they can’t just call 911. But they can call a union, even if they’re not a member. And when they do, we don’t just listen — we take action.
Our union stood up for the workers who were denied fair pay. A felony conviction was secured — a rare and meaningful outcome in a system where wage theft is too often treated like a paperwork issue instead of the serious crime it is.
Newell will be sentenced on June 6 and could face up to a year in jail. He is also effectively barred from working on city of Minneapolis projects going forward. That matters. That’s accountability. And it wouldn’t have happened without union involvement.
For too long, wage theft cases were limited to slow-moving civil enforcement. That meant justice was delayed — and often denied. But now, thanks to partnerships between labor and forward-thinking prosecutors, these cases are being prioritized. Minnesota now has some of the toughest anti-wage theft laws in the country because our legislators understand that when wage theft is allowed to go unchecked, it sends the wrong message to bad actors: that cheating workers is just part of doing business.

It’s not. It’s a crime.
When unions are strong, wage theft doesn’t stand a chance. We don’t just protect our own members — we protect the standards for everyone. That’s why the work we do matters not just for unionized workers, but for non-union workers, too. When we raise the alarm, the whole industry hears it.
We’re proud of the bravery of the workers who spoke up and called us when they were being cheated. We’re also proud of the future partnerships we’ve built with the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, and the Labor Council Advisory Committee.
But we also know this is just one case. 
Wage theft could be happening right now — today — on job sites across this state. It could be happening to workers without representation, without protections, and without a clear path to justice.
If you’re a worker experiencing wage theft, don’t wait. Don’t go it alone. Call a union. We are the first step, we are the frontline, and we are ready to fight for you.

There is a deep irony that the face of resistance against Ron DeSantis’ efforts to conceal and misrepresent Florida’s Black history has lived the very history that the governor and his arch-conservative/MAGA buddies are working so hard to erase.
Racism and discrimination are poisons that have infected every part of this country and all of its institutions, including the legal and criminal justice system, education and academia, the military, the media, and healthcare. Segregation, discrimination and legal and de facto separation of the races was never stamped out and is rearing its ugly head again thanks to arch-conservative elements seeking to return the state and the country to a time when Black people occupied a place several tiers below their white counterparts.
Although the governor is wont to sugarcoat the brutality of chattel slavery, Jim Crow, segregation, and the casual, ruthless treatment of African Americans in Florida, 84-year-old historian and scholar Dr. Marvin Dunn is living proof of the lies and emptiness of the DeSantis/MAGA narrative.
He and other Black people carry in their bones the wretched history that DeSantis and others so desperately want to hide.
‘I know Jim Crow’

“I knew Jim Crow. I grew up in Florida under his dark, suffocating wings. I knew him intimately, as did every Black person I knew growing up in Deland and Miami in the 1940s and 50s,” Dunn writes in his book, “A History of Florida: Through Black Eyes.”
“He hovered over every aspect of the first twenty-five years of my life, sucking ambition from me. I grew up during the last vestiges of his reign. I was so used to seeing the signs that read, “Whites seat from front – Colored seat from rear” on public buses that, when they were finally removed in the 1960s, sometimes I thought I still saw them there.
“Even after his death, Jim Crow was, for a while, omnipresent mentally and emotionally in our lives; such had been his reach. No black person I knew escaped the impact of the Jim Crow system or the possibility of being killed for no other reason than being black. A black person in Florida, during the time I grew up, lived with a pervasive awareness of the limitations a racist society imposed and of the impact those limitations imposed upon one’s life.”
With the passage of time, fading memories, and historical misinformation and disinformation, DeSantis and others seek to soften the violent, random, heartless system and spare the descendants of the perpetrators the pain of memory.
Against this background, Dunn’s is one voice standing up to the DeSantis political steamroller. He is a man whose actions are consistent with his values and beliefs. Dunn’s stories, books, lectures, and interviews serve as a poignant reminder of the power and potency of Black people.

Racial caste system
Dunn, 84, is countering the lies, hateful rhetoric, suppression of free speech and dissent, and efforts to intimidate critics and anyone standing up to DeSantis and the MAGA horde.
Dunn was born in DeLand and grew up in the segregated South to a family that endured the indignities of Jim Crow and struggled economically because of racism and segregation, not because they didn’t work damn hard.
Dunn says in his book that in June 1940, he was born in an orange grove barn in the Blackberry community of DeLand. Corinne Elizabeth Williams, his mother, was a housecleaner and cook, and his father, James C. Dunn Sr., was a fruit and vegetable picker. The family were migrants who harvested crops in DeLand and Hicksville on Long Island, N.Y., he recalled.
He vividly remembers that every aspect of Black life was suffocated by the rigid racial caste system that consigned African Americans to second- and third-class citizenship manifested in inferior living accommodations; the worst-paying jobs, and a joke of an educational system. Black schools were in deplorable condition, the books were hand-me-downs, and children often had to walk miles to school in all types of weather, often passing sturdy, well-constructed white schools on the way.
“For most blacks of my generation in Florida, and I suspect elsewhere, the inferiority of our blackness was instilled in us by the people who were closest to us, our parents and grandparents,” Dunn writes.
Disrespect
“Jim Crow ruled. We used the colored water fountain at the Volusia County Courthouse. The water was not chilled as it was in the white fountain. We used bathrooms in the basement that were marked for ‘colored.’ I noticed that when I went downtown with my mother to shop, whites had the privilege of skipping ahead of us. Essentially, in the South at that time, a white person was not expected to wait until a black person was served, which would have been an act of subservience, or at least, respect.”
Noted Civil Rights attorney Benjamin Crump captured Dunn’s life’s work.
“As Black history is scrubbed from classrooms, Dr. Marvin Dunn is planting truth — literally. Under a tree at FL Int’l Univ, he’s teaching the Rosewood massacre and handing out banned books. In a state erasing our past, Black educators are once again forced to be the curriculum,” Crump wrote.
Meanwhile, after being named chair of the FIU Psychology department, Dunn co-produced several video documentaries. His FIU archival collection now consists of more than 4,000 photographs and images reflecting the Florida Black experience.
As a historian specializing in Black Florida history and culture, Dunn is founder and president of the Miami Center for Racial Justice and is known for organizing the “Teach the Truth” tours, which highlight Florida’s history of racial violence. Center staff members take participants to historic sites related to the history of racial violence in the state.
Dunn’s books include his “History of Florida,” “Black Miami in the Twentieth Century,” and “The Miami Riot of 1980: Crossing the Bounds.” In July 2024, the center received a Mellon Foundation grant of $1.5 million to extend this work to Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.
‘Insult to injury’
Except for an occasional phenomenon like Joe Louis, Jackie Robinson, or Gloria Lockerman, Dunn remembers, Black Floridians saw little that was worth emulating.
“Adding insult to injury, this was by design, and Florida itself was complicit in it by subjecting us to a segregated education system that intentionally depicted African Americans primarily as laborers,” he writes in his “History.”
“My education in Florida schools skipped over slavery with a few drawings of slaves picking cotton and appearing happy to be doing it. They had neat little cabins with little black children playing in the background. Florida was complicit because it imposed upon us a racist educational system that denied us our heroes, heroines and fighters. It was an effective, intentional and insipid way of milking ambition from generations of black Floridians,” Dunn writes in his “History.”
DeSantis’ Florida, and by extension about half of America, are places where one group of people believe they have the God-given right to alter the truth, expurgate historical facts, and suppress the racial violence, lynching, and destruction of Black communities in Ocooe and Rosewood in the early 20th Century. They’re intent on erasing the savagery and casual violence and diminishing the accomplishments Black Floridians wrote into history.
William DC Clark, a South Florida retired firefighter and paramedic, argues African Americans and their allies must fight like hell against this tyranny of the minority on all fronts.
“By now everyone knows that Trump (and DeSantis) are trying to erase any significant gains that Blacks have made. They’re trying to make it look like we didn’t even exist. Some say they’re trying to take us back to the day when we were considered 3/5ths of a man,” Clark, president of the DCS Mentoring Program in Miami, told me in a recent interview.

Passive no more
“But what gets me is, when most reporters report on the latest DEI snub or latest firing of a top-ranked Black person, they do so as if they were reporting on someone being given a ticket for jaywalking.
“Maybe they feel the same way as Trump. Maybe they’re so used to many of us being so passive that it’s normal to them. But this is anything but normal and contrary to their beliefs, some of us will die for our freedom. FAFO if you want to … .”
The days of Blacks only having the option of cleaning white people’s homes; being prohibited from entering through the front door; being forced to step off the sidewalk when white people approached; enduring busing to get an education; and keeping Blacks in line are dead.
Dunn and Clark are the tip of widespread resistance in Florida and elsewhere to the grotesque efforts by Ron DeSantis and the Republican-majority Legislature, GOP leaders, policymakers, and donors to drag the country back to Jim Crow.
DeSantis and his hobgoblins probably think they’ve won this battle because the opposition is afraid and confused, and too many have been cowed into silence. But all of us need to do as Clark and Dunn have done and continue to fight against the forces of ignorance by organizing, protesting, engaging in civil disobedience, and using the courts, literature, music, and theater arts. Because, despite what the MAGA crowd posits, African Americans are Americans too.

The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.


The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)State budget negotiations were top of mind for lawmakers Thursday, even as the Senate took action on a variety of bills, with Senate Republicans calling for a meeting with Gov. Tony Evers and Democrats calling on Republicans to support Evers’ budget requests. 
The Wisconsin Legislature is in the process of writing the next biennial budget, and Republicans are intent on passing a tax cut this session after failing to get Evers’ approval for a proposed cut last session.
Republican leaders have said they want an agreement on the tax cut before allocating spending to other priorities, and are waiting for Evers to schedule an in-person meeting with them to work it out.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said during a press conference ahead of a Senate floor session Thursday that Evers’ office has had lawmakers’ plan for a tax cut since March and that they have asked Evers for a list of specific items that he would want in the budget to agree to cutting taxes. However, LeMahieu said they haven’t been given any details in the last several weeks.
“Speaker Vos and I provided the governor with a series of times [to meet] into next week as a last-ditch effort to preserve these good faith negotiations,” LeMahieu said. “I hope sincerely that he accepts… one of those dates next week. It’s imperative that we meet by the end of next week at the latest to stay on schedule to pass a budget by the end of the fiscal year. It’s as simple as that. Time’s ticking… and if we’re going to work to get a budget passed, we need to meet with the governor next week.”
LeMahieu said GOP tax goals include exempting income for retirees in Wisconsin to encourage them to stay in the state and increasing the second-tier tax bracket, similar to a bill the governor vetoed last session. LeMahieu said the new tax bracket won’t reach as high up the income ladder as the vetoed one.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said on Tuesday that work on the budget is “on pause” until legislators get an in-person meeting with Evers and that their preferred option is “to be able to get an agreed upon tax cut so that we know we have X dollars to invest in schools and health care and all the other things that are important.” 
LeMahieu said that the latest Legislative Fiscal Bureau report would also be pivotal in negotiations because it will help lawmakers understand “what kind of tax cut we can afford” and “what kind of other investments we can afford.”
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected in the fiscal estimate released Thursday afternoon that the state will finish the 2023-25 fiscal year, which ends June 30, with a $4.3 billion budget surplus, which is slightly higher than the estimate from January. However, the estimate also found that tax collection will likely be lower over the next two years.
“While we are not surprised by these new estimates, we remain cautious as we work to craft a budget that invests in our priorities, funds our obligations, and puts the State of Wisconsin in a strong fiscal position for the future,” Joint Finance Committee Co-chairs Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) and Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said in a statement. 
The lawmakers said that the estimates are a sign that they need to continue to approach the budget in the same way they have in the past. They also called on Evers to “take these revenue re-estimates seriously” and to “come to the table with legislative leaders and work with us to craft a reasonable budget that works for Wisconsin.” 
Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee said in a statement that the estimate is a sign of the decline the economy could face due to Trump administration tariffs. 
“Now, more than ever, Wisconsinites are struggling to put food on the table and maintain a roof over their heads. This projection shows it’s going to get even worse, especially when our communities start to feel the direct impact of the Trump regime’s trade war around the globe,” the lawmakers said. “Together, we need to ensure Wisconsinites have the resources to get through the chaos and uncertainty that lies ahead.” 
Ahead of the floor session, Democratic lawmakers called attention to Evers’ budget requests, saying that the various non-budget bills the Senate took up Thursday don’t address the issues that Wisconsinites are most concerned about. 
“It’s been 87 days since [Evers] has introduced his budget. It invests in essential priorities — K-12 funding, child care education, mental health, helping the environment and putting much needed funding in the university system. What have Republicans done in those 87 days? Well, they stripped essential items in that budget….” Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) said at a press conference. “What the Legislature should do is debate the budget.”
Wisconsin Republicans on the Joint Finance Committee cut over 600 items from Evers’ proposal last week , saying they were taking the budget “back to base.” 
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) noted that lawmakers recently traveled across the state to hear from Wisconsinites about their priorities for the state budget and then failed to act on any of those priorities. She then listed several bills on Thursday’s calendar. 
“We’ve got a bill on changing the name on the name-change process for people convicted of violent crimes; a bill that gives big businesses their own private courts; a bill tweaking surcharges for electric vehicles,” Johnson said. “I’m not saying that these bills aren’t important to someone, but we sure didn’t hear about these issues when we traveled across the state at our listening sessions.” 
Johnson said that lawmakers need to ask if the bills “meet the moment” the state is facing. 
“Do they lower the cost for hard-working families? Do they help us hire nurses, teachers, child care providers? Do they clean our water and keep our streets safe [or remediate] lead contaminated classrooms?” Johnson asked. “If the answer is no, then why the hell are we here?” 
Democrats, including Hesselbein, have said they think Democratic votes will be necessary to pass a budget, but they don’t necessarily expect to be in the room for budget negotiations between legislative Republicans and Evers.
Asked if Democrats are requesting to participate in a sit-down between Evers and Republicans, Hesselbein said she is “in consistent contact with Gov. Evers and his administration, and those conversations have been both before and moving forward.” 
Pressed on whether she wants to be in the room when the governor and Republicans meet, Hesselbein said “I’ll be honest, sometimes it’s hard to get all of us in the same room because of timing and schedules and things like that.”
Some of the bills that the Senate took action on Thursday include: 

SB 33, which would make it a crime to share nonconsensual “deep fake” nude images and was introduced in reaction to the growing use of artificial intelligence to make fake images. It passed unanimously. 
SB 125, which would require the Public Service Commission to conduct a study for a place to locate a nuclear power plant. It passed with bipartisan support from 28 Senators. Four Democrats and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) voted against the bill. 
SB 96, which would exempt electric vehicle charging stations at a person’s home from the electric vehicle charging tax. It passed unanimously. 
SB 146, which would bar someone convicted of a violent crime including homicide, battery, kidnapping, stalking, human trafficking and sexual assault from changing their name, passed 18-15 in a party line vote.
The Senate also passed AB 73 in an 18-15 vote. The bill would create a specialized commercial court meant to handle business cases. It comes after the state Supreme Court discontinued a pilot program last year.

But without water, survival time drops to 3-7 days.  Clearly, if we don’t drink water, we quickly die from dehydration.  Given that the human body is 76% water, one might think as a society we would put the absolute highest priority on maintaining this most vitally necessary substance for our survival.  
Unfortunately, that is not the case on either the federal or state level as politicians pander to the never-ending demands to lower water quality standards to appease industries, municipalities, water utilities, and to muster support by claiming deregulation is “cutting red tape.”
The average American would be shocked to know what’s in their water — as well as what passes through both fresh and wastewater treatment plants. Nor are the effects of the growing multitude of pollutants a mystery.  Scientists and doctors know certain substances are extremely deleterious to human health. Yet, bowing to the pressures of commerce or cost, the current direction is to allow more, not less of these substances in our water.  
The most recent egregious example is the move by Lee Zeldin, now the head of Trump’s mis-named Environmental Protection Agency, to roll back the limits on PFAS, that were first adopted by Biden’s administration just last year.
PFAS are a group of widely-used substances which are known as “forever chemicals” because they are basically impossible to remove once they are in the human body or environment.  They are classified by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer as “carcinogenic to humans.” 
In March, only a month after being confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin claimed he was making “the largest deregulatory announcement in U.S. history” by redirecting the EPA to favor deregulation and energy production. He claims his rollback of PFAS standards in drinking water is introducing “common-sense flexibility” by kicking the compliance date out to 2031 and rescinding standards on three PFAS substances. But continuing to poison the population surely doesn’t make much common sense. 
While the deregulatory wrecking ball crashes into the federal water quality standards, Montana’s legislature and governor have similarly decided to turn our water quality regulations to a sort of mush by repealing “numerical standards” that measure the amount of pollutants actually in the water to “narrative standards.”  
As reported, narrative standards are described by the Department of Environmental Quality as “more general statements of unacceptable conditions in and on the water.”  To put it mildly, this change does not portend cleaner water for Montanans and is now the subject of a lawsuit by the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper group challenging the agency’s use of narrative standards in its refusal to list the Big Hole River as impaired due to nutrient pollution.
Despite being at the very headwaters of the nation’s mightiest rivers, studies in Montana’s major river valleys found an alarming number of chemical pollutants in our groundwater, domestic, and commercial wells.  The Helena Valley study, for instance, found “pharmaceutically active” compounds including antibiotics, hormones, and drugs as well as the herbicide atrazine in the groundwater/well samples…all of which affect both humans and aquatic life.  
Simply put, we’re heading in the wrong direction and fouling our own nest by moving to capitulate to commerce rather than regulating pollutants to protect the health of our citizens and environment.  We know the damage is being done.  And no amount of short-term profits can or ever will replace the most vitally necessary substance for life — good, clean water.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1368715188-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 07:04:24.369482

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A coalition of news organizations, including the Indiana Capital Chronicle, is asking a federal judge to block a state law barring press from witnessing state executions, arguing it violates the First Amendment. 
The Indiana Attorney General’s Office, in response to the preliminary injunction request, urged the court on Thursday to deny what state attorneys called a “last-minute” and legally baseless request.
The dispute centers on an Indiana law that limits attendance at executions to: the warden, a warden’s designated assistant, the prison physician, another physician, a spiritual advisor, a prison chaplain, five friends or relatives of the inmate and eight members of the victim’s family.
A Department of Correction (DOC) policy also says press “shall not be permitted to witness the execution.”
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
Five media outlets filed the underlying lawsuit last week. Attorneys with the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press are representing the news entities.










A lack of press access leaves the public with an incomplete understanding of the proceedings.


– complaint filed by five news entities, including the Indiana Capital Chronicle


A hearing before Judge Matthew Brookman is scheduled for Friday morning in Evansville, in Indiana’s southern district. It’s not clear if Brookman will make a decision at that hearing.
The state attempted to move the legal matter to the federal court in Indiana’s northern district, but that request was denied by the judge.
Court proceedings come just days before the scheduled execution of death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. The prison warden said in a declaration filed Thursday that Ritchie has not requested media be permitted as one of his five witnesses.
The execution is set to take place before sunrise on Tuesday, May 20, and will be the second death sentence carried out in Indiana since the state resumed capital punishment last year. 
Before that, executions were on a hiatus for more than a decade.
Media organizations seek urgent intervention
Media organizations asked the federal court to intervene before Ritchie’s execution. They’re also seeking access to future executions until the broader legal challenge is resolved.
In a motion for a preliminary injunction filed Monday, the five media outlets — including the Capital Chronicle, The Associated Press, Gannett, Circle City Broadcasting and TEGNA — argued that Indiana Code and DOC policy violate their First Amendment rights by denying press access to executions.
The groups contends that journalists, as representatives of the public, are entitled to witness executions — a critical part of the criminal justice process.
Reporters from all five entities have covered portions of the case and The Associated Press regularly covers executions nationwide.
Indiana is one of 27 states with the death penalty, but one of only two states — along with Wyoming — that doesn’t include media witnesses at executions.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith witnessed December’s state execution of Joseph Corcoran — via the inmate’s guest list.

Plaintiffs argued that this restriction undermines a key purpose of the First Amendment: public accountability.
“Loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,” the plaintiffs said in the motion for preliminary injunction, quoting a 2012 opinion issued by a federal judge in Illinois in a separate media access case.
The news entities pointed out in their complaint that the federal government permits journalists to observe executions conducted at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute.
They also held that Indiana’s law treats the press more harshly than other members of the public. While victims’ families and a condemned person’s friends or clergy may attend, the media is explicitly barred unless a journalist is handpicked by the inmate.
“The statute and policy single out the press for disfavorable treatment,” attorneys said in the complaint.
“A lack of press access leaves the public with an incomplete understanding of the proceedings,” they continued, citing examples from recent federal executions in which journalists documented botched attempts and unusual behavior by medical staff or inmates — observations that would not have been publicly known otherwise.
State contends media already have access
But in a 25-page filing submitted Thursday, the state pushed back, arguing that executions are not judicial proceedings covered by the First Amendment’s right of public access. 
The attorney general’s office additionally emphasized that Indiana law permits inmates to designate up to five witnesses — potentially including reporters — meaning journalists are not categorically banned.
“This lawsuit seeks to establish privileged access for the press beyond what the law generally provides the public,” state attorneys wrote. “The Constitution does not mandate privileging the press.”
Defendants also argued that executions are not part of the judicial or adjudicative process, and said in their response that a criminal prosecution comes to an end once a sentence is imposed. 
“After that, the individual is committed to the executive for execution of the sentence,” the attorney general’s office wrote.
Story continues below.

The office leaned on a 19th-century U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave states broad power to regulate executions — including who can witness them. 
“These are regulations which the legislature, in its wisdom, and for the public good, could legally prescribe,” the state quoted from Holden v. Minnesota, decided in 1890. The attorney general’s office emphasized that even banning press entirely from executions is constitutionally permissible.
The state also criticized the plaintiffs for waiting until days before the execution to file their motion, calling the timing “inequitable” and a bid to delay a lawfully imposed sentence.
 “They waited … until only seven days and three minutes before the scheduled initiation of the execution they now seek to enjoin,” the filing continued.
The state warned, too, that any sudden change in procedure, such as allowing unvetted media access, could complicate operations and compromise staff anonymity.
“Adding an unknown number of persons into the facility and into this process to witness a currently undefined portion of this procedure greatly complicates the strong interest the State has in performing a complex operation,” per the attorney general’s office.
New details about execution protocols
State officials have largely shielded details about how Indiana executions are carried out, but the state’s motion — in addition to a declaration provided by Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal — sheds light on DOC’s extensive planning and training.
According to the state, executions are performed by a specially-trained group that’s divided into multiple sub-units ,including an injection team, IV team, extraction team, and a death watch unit.
Each member of the execution team must pass medical, psychological and background screenings. The teams regularly train every two to three months, but when a death warrant is scheduled, that schedule increases to biweekly. 
New document shows Indiana paid $900,000 for execution drug, but other details still sparse

Since the Indiana Supreme Court issued the death warrant for Ritchie on April 15, the teams have been training weekly, Neal said.
Hands-on training involves simulations for IV insertion using EMS-provided equipment and infrared technology to locate veins.
Thirty days before an execution, officials begin preparations inside the facility, Neal noted in his declaration. 
The condemned inmate undergoes a medical evaluation and weekly assessments of their veins for IV access. The execution chamber is cleaned and inspected weekly, then daily in the final five days before the scheduled execution date. 
Equipment, supplies, and communication systems — linking the prison and the chamber to the governor’s office, the Indiana Supreme Court and internal command centers — are tested, as well.
Prison officials meet with the inmate to discuss the lethal injection process, witness lists and options for final statements and spiritual advisement.
The DOC protocol also includes test runs to ensure the victim’s family is kept separate from the condemned’s witnesses. Two-way radios on separate frequencies from normal prison traffic ensure real-time coordination throughout the process.
Gov. Mike Braun rejected a clemency plea from Ritchie on Wednesday, one day after the Indiana Parole Board recommended that the death row inmate’s upcoming execution proceed as scheduled.
Ritchie, who fatally shot Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney during a police pursuit on Sept. 29, 2000, had petitioned the board to commute his death sentence to life without parole.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)ALMA, Ark. — Dozens of people attended a public hearing Thursday at the Alma Community Center near Fort Smith, where several individuals and elected officials spoke about how pungent odors from land-application operations in the area have affected their lives and region. 
Denali, a waste recycling company that applies waste left over from chicken and other industrial processing, has earned the ire of Sebastian and Crawford County residents due to overpowering odors from a sludge lagoon in Van Buren and huge increases in the amount of waste it applies to fields in the area.
Now, with one of its Crawford County land application permits up for renewal, that ire was on full display at the hearing held by the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality. Not one person who spoke during the comment period spoke in favor of granting the permit renewal.
  The permit 

Denali’s application to renew an existing land application permit in Crawford County would add 670 acres of applicable fields to the roughly 1,500 acres already permitted.
Denali has struggled to comply with — and knowingly violated, according to records — its permits in recent months. Starting last year, Denali began land application within 24 hours of predicted rainfall, which is a violation of its permits, despite a rebuke from DEQ’s top water official. That culminated in a $19,800 fine earlier this year, something many residents have called “a slap in the face” for being too low.
The state of Missouri’s decision to disallow Denali from land application on Missouri fields led to an effective doubling of land application volume in Arkansas, according to Arkansas state records. In the same 2024 letter, the company pressed ADEQ to speed up the approval process for multiple pending land application permits.
  The hearing 

A restaurant owner among those who spoke at the hearing in Alma, said he couldn’t use his patio when the odor wafted over Fort Smith. The patio made up 20% of his revenue, he said.
Michael Gray, a wildlife biologist, said he bought land in the area in 2021 for recreational waterfowl hunting, with the additional hope of restoring the wetlands on it as well. Denali’s land application directly next to his property, he said, had potentially left his wetlands “damaged forever.” 
“Now learning that ADEQ fined the company only $19,000 for repeated violations is a slap in my face since I spent nearly double that” to try to clean up pollution he believes is caused by Denali’s land application practices. 
Meanwhile, Neva and Ralph Bogner, who have repeatedly complained to the Division of Environmental Quality about Denali’s permit violations, expressed concerns about the land the company wanted to add to the permit as part of the renewal. 
They said they could already smell the waste being applied to the fields two miles away at times, with Ralph Bogner previously describing the smell as one “like death.” If DEQ approves the permit renewal, a new field only a mile away will be available for waste application, Neva Bogner said.
Local officials expressed frustrations with Denali when they took to the microphone, with at-large Fort Smith City Director Christina Catsavis saying the company went back on a 2019 promise that it would shut down the Van Buren lagoon. The smell was impacting the area’s growth and economic prospects, multiple officials said, causing events to be cancelled and outdoor recreation to be unenjoyable.
“These odors are pungent and nauseating,” Catsavis said. “Denali has not demonstrated a responsible approach to their operation, and the history of complaints, legal action and public disruption should weigh heavily against permit renewal.”
Fort Smith Mayor George McGill made similar remarks, adding that the stench had even caught the attention of the F-35 fighter training facility located in the city.
State Rep. Cindy Crawford, R-Fort Smith, also addressed the room, saying that after hearing the comments of area residents, she planned to ask Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders to help, saying, “We can’t do this.”
Nancy LaPierre, a spokesperson for Denali, said assertions by the speakers that Denali did not live in the area or understand the smell were incorrect.
“We live and work here too, right?” she told the Advocate after the hearing. “And the communities are important to us. … We heard everything that folks had to say here. We do have a plan in place that we have been executing and we’ll continue to execute.”
Rep. Brad Hall, R-Alma, wrote Act 1009 of 2025, a new state law that requires DEQ to levy the maximum penalty on future land application violations. After the hearing, he said that while he was optimistic Denali would solve the problem, he was prepared to take further action in the 2027 session if necessary.
“We have a year and a half to come up with different avenues,” Hall said.
A decision has not been made as to whether DEQ will grant the permit renewal.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Our state has a shadowed history when it comes to racial issues that includes the forced removal of Native Americans on Trail of Tears, the slaughter of Black residents during Tulsa Race Massacre and a 2007 law touted to be the nation’s harshest anti-immigrant state law.
I’ve long watched as Oklahoma’s elected officials have failed to learn from and rectify that dark history. Instead, they’ve oft chosen to embark on campaigns that seem to further highlight those past inequities.
It had seemed that we were growing more comfortable with teaching public school students about these dark tales. My administrators were supportive of history teachers teaching about injustices in our criminal justice system, lawful racial segregation and the abuse of immigrants. In fact, I was allowed to discuss how the best of our pioneer spirit has been intertwined with immigration from a variety of countries. Immigrants brought with them the values of hard work, family and community.
But today, we are again seeing a cruel backlash against migrants and communities who are racially different.
That backlash has included prohibitions against discussing “race” in schools. State Superintendent Ryan Walters has attempted to pass a requirement that “students must provide proof of U.S. citizenship when enrolling in public school.” It would also force schools to report to the state the number of students “who couldn’t verify legal residency or citizenship.”
Moreover, under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, some Oklahoma law enforcement officers can “arrest individuals without a warrant if they are suspected of violating immigration laws” if it is believed that they “are likely to evade capture.” But even that raises the question as to who makes that judgment call.
Oklahoma City has been in the headlines after a mother and her daughters were traumatized by a raid conducted at the wrong home by federal officers. They were forced outside their apartment in their underclothes by agents who had misidentified them. The officers ripped up their home, seized phones and took much of the woman’s life savings. And, they didn’t give any information about getting her property back.
And Gov. Kevin Stitt recently generated ire when he vetoed a bill funding the Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons on the national advocacy day that brings attention to the crisis. Hours before his veto, Indigenous advocates were rallying outside the state Capitol to bring attention to the fact that our state has the second highest number of missing Native Americans. Stitt argued in his veto message that “justice must be blind to race.”
I’ll also never forget when lawmakers passed the Oklahoma Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act of 2007, which was designed to be the nation’s harshest anti-immigrant state law. After that law took effect, federal agents would intimidate parents as they dropped their kids off at elementary schools. When one of my student’s family was deported for legally driving down the Broadway Extension, they were forced to get down on their knees. They unsuccessfully begged the police officer to not turn them over to ICE.
The law accomplished nothing except for spreading a “culture of fear,” and opposition to it grew. As Hispanic workers exited the state, business leaders, church congregations, and civil rights advocates joined the fight against anti-immigrant racism.
I’m encouraged that today’s cycle of cruelty is also bringing forth another, and I believe larger, side of our nation and state, which is coming to the defense of immigrants. For instance, there has been bipartisan pushback, including by Stitt, against Walters’ support for immigration raids in schools, and collecting information about immigrants that would be turned over to the federal government.
But we’re at a crossroads. Do we embrace the dark side, which has traditionally been driven by fear and racism, or do we embrace a path of inclusionary hope that aims to not repeat the mistakes of our past?
Today’s attacks on immigrants are an outgrowth of our dark side, but I have reason to believe that we’ll choose the path of hope by learning from the sordid sides of our past.
I believe there will be a time again when our political leaders recognize the proven economic benefits brought by undocumented workers. I believe we’ll again recognize the harm that is done to our reputation when Oklahoma doesn’t stand up for its residents.
Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it’s that doing the right thing always encourages economic investments, entrepreneurs, and brings new opportunities to our state.

Trout Unlimited’s Trout-in-the-classroom program brought five Wind River Indian Reservation schools outside last week for the finale: releasing fry in Washakie Reservoir.

Rainbow trout fry writhed inside. 
The classmate critiques started coming. Too many fish. Too little water. They’d been confined for too long. Duren’s fellow seventh graders urged him to complete the release. A reservoir awaited a few dozen yards away. 
“That’s a Travis Scott concert right there,” Eli Washakie said of the crowded cup.

Another youngster was more blunt: “I think they’re gonna die soon.” 
Duren held his ground. 
“They’re part of my family now,” he joked. “I can’t just let them go.” 
The calls to free the fry persisted. Moments later, the diminutive salmonids swam off. 
The middle school banter on the banks of Washakie Reservoir was set in motion by Trout Unlimited’s Trout-in-the-classroom program. The swarms of fry that swam off this spring morning spent their earliest days of life in seven tanks distributed around the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
“We have all five reservation schools represented here,” said Jeremy Molt, Shoshone and Arapaho Fish and Game’s youth coordinator. “This is one of the only programs where you’ll see all the reservation schools coming together — usually, they don’t do anything like this.”

Rearing trout in classroom tanks for their eventual release is the bait that gets kids hooked on lesson plans about watersheds and fisheries, Trout Unlimited’s Cory Toye said. Mike Mazur, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fish biologist, commended the effort. 
“They’re trying to reconnect the kids back to natural resources: Get them outside, exposed to something other than a screen,” he said. “Especially for tribal people, the connection to the natural world is really important.”
On May 7, the middle and high school students, usually cooped up in classrooms, relished the chance to get outside.

But shifting market and political forces challenge state’s otherwise reliable and expanding trona mining industry.
The post From toothpaste to beer bottles to industrial batteries, the world relies on Wyoming’s ‘white gold’ appeared first on WyoFile .","GREEN RIVER—After a four-minute elevator descent into the bowels of southwest Wyoming, dropping deep enough to bury the Empire State Building, a Tata Chemicals trona miner drove two Wyoming journalists in a truck 8.5 miles through catacombs, crossing under unaware motorists on Interstate 80 above, to where a crew was using an electric boring machine to chew into a wall of trona.
The visitors — briefed on safety protocols and equipped with underground attire and emergency devices — trudged through fresh mud bubbling with methane. Sections were added to a chartreuse inflatable tube that unrolled like a party favor and blew fresh air at the miners, who had just finished patching a small water line break. 
Beams of light from hard hats swiveled and sparred in the tunnel as the earth moaned and machinery hummed. Soon, the machinery funneled a stream of sandwich-sized chunks of trona onto a fast-moving conveyor that would eventually deliver it to the surface to be processed into a fine, white powder and shipped around the world.

Have you ever brushed your teeth with toothpaste? Drank beer from a bottle or stared at the road through a car windshield? The white stuff — sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) to be precise — calms your heartburn and washes your socks. Check under your sink. Take a look in your bathroom cabinet. Many of those taken-for-granted products you use daily require an ingredient sourced from the depths of southwest Wyoming, and the sweat of underground miners.
Tata’s mine, along with its soda ash processing facilities at the surface, is among four such operations in Wyoming — all clustered in an area near the towns of Green River and Granger. Combined, they produce about 10 million tons of soda ash annually and feed 90% of the nation’s soda ash consumption. Wyoming producers make up more than 14% of the global market, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Soda ash, in fact, accounts for more than half of Wyoming’s global commodity exports with a whopping $1.3 billion worth of shipments annually, according to industry officials and state economists.
Wyoming coal can’t say that. Not even close. 
Despite the industry’s global importance and massive operations, employing some 2,500 workers in the state, it plods along without much fanfare. Unless you live in the region, you might not even know about trona or its role in everyday life.
“If you’re in Cheyenne and you say ‘trona’ or ‘soda ash,’ a lot of people will say, ‘What’s that?'” said longtime Green River resident Stan Blake who served as House District 39 representative from 2007 to 2020. The business, perhaps, is guilty of being kind of boring, or simply void of political drama, Blake suggested. “It’s just been steady for years and years, so it doesn’t get talked about much.”

It was a mystery, even to many who began their careers in coal mining and wound up at this trona mine. “I wasn’t even aware of trona until I came to Wyoming,” said Mine Electrical Planner Kale Pitt. When asked about the significance of the industry, another Tata miner said, “Other than they make glass and soap out of it, that’s about all I know. It’s a good way to make a living, I guess.”
The miner turned his headlamp and went back to the business at hand.
He was spot on, in Blake’s estimation, who was never a trona miner himself. He spent more than 30 years on the rails and in train yards rather than chipping at trona in Wyoming’s subterranean, but he knows his Green River neighbors and notices toys in driveways.
“The level of lifestyle out here is higher, probably, than a lot of other places in the state,” Blake said. “It seems like everybody’s got a boat and they go out to Flaming Gorge and fish. And everybody — all the miners — like to hunt. The [trona] mines are really, really relevant here in Sweetwater County, that’s for sure.” 
Perhaps less glorious than coal, less loud than oil, there are changes afoot in the trona industry with implications, both good and potentially not so good, for Wyoming.
Optimism and expansion 
Baking soda and Range Rover windshields aside, Wyoming trona mine owners have been scrambling to meet new opportunities while bracing for headwinds.
“The world has an insatiable appetite for soda ash.”Jon Conrad, Tata Chemicals
On the opportune side, there’s wildly escalating demand for batteries and solar energy panels across the globe, according to industry reports. Though the business of toothpaste and baking soda doesn’t change much, global manufacturers are keen on ramping up production of energy components vital to meeting low-carbon initiatives. They can’t do it without more trona processed into soda ash. And Wyoming has a lot of trona — the largest known deposit in the world, according to industry and federal officials. Ninety percent of the world’s mineable, or “natural,” trona ore is right here in southwest Wyoming, they say.
“The world has an insatiable appetite for soda ash,” said Wyoming Tata’s Director of Governmental Affairs Jon Conrad, also a former Wyoming legislator. By Conrad’s estimation, the industry in Wyoming aims to expand — perhaps even double production in the next eight or so years.

In addition to Tata’s plans to crank out more soda ash while trimming its cost of production, neighboring producer WE Soda — with a larger operation than Tata’s — has launched a multi-billion-dollar expansion that’s crossing permitting milestones. A big part of that effort, “Project West,” will include “solution” mining, or pumping water into the trona deposits to flush the material to the surface rather than sending legions of boat-owning miners underground, according to the company.
Federal regulators also recently advanced permitting for a potential fifth trona operation in the region — Pacific Soda’s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine project, which would also pull trona via water injection-and-return wells. The operation would create an estimated additional 300 full-time jobs in the region, according to the company.

All of that optimism and investment, however, might stand a little broadside to some shifting market and political winds.
Shifting markets
Wyoming’s trona industry has, for decades, won an advantage for producing “natural” soda ash. It’s pretty simple: mine the rocks, crush them, dissolve and dehydrate the mineral and ship it to customers. But for the past couple of decades, China and Turkey have ramped up production of synthetic soda ash — a product derived from flushing sodium carbonate-containing material from more prevalent, less pure deposits.
Synthetic soda ash threatens to beat out natural soda ash on price, according to industry officials. Though Wyoming producers claim their product is superior for both its quality and lower-carbon footprint, natural soda ash producers must find efficiencies to lower their cost of production.
Solution mining is one major cost-efficiency strategy, according to Conrad. Another is finding alternatives to expensive electrical power and other forms of energy.

Mining trona and processing it into soda ash requires a lot of electricity — about a continuous 32 megawatts at Tata Chemicals, according to the company. One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes. Tata produces about 90% of its own electricity, via coal and natural gas burners, which also generate steam used in the refining process. But the operation relies on utility provider Rocky Mountain Power for the rest of its electricity needs, and those costs keep climbing. Tata wants to reduce or eliminate its reliance on Rocky Mountain Power by incorporating nuclear energy.
Last year, the company inked a letter of intent with BWXT Advanced Technologies to install up to eight nuclear microreactors on site, boosting Tata’s self-produced electrical power to about 40 megawatts — enough to meet expansion plans without increasing its reliance on Rocky Mountain Power. “The microreactors offer a carbon-free, reliable source of energy that can support [Tata Chemicals’] operations and contribute to the state’s energy portfolio,” the company said in a prepared statement.
But even the industry’s best-laid plans to increase its competitive edge could be derailed by politics. President Donald Trump’s tariff wars take particular aim at China, which accounts for about 10% of Wyoming soda ash sales. If the country retaliates with its own tariffs, it could be a major blow to the industry, according to University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby. It might even dampen the industry’s plans to expand operations.
“That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,” Godby said.
Back underground, Mine Production Supervisor Eric Castillon proudly described a continual process of increasing production efficiencies in a never-ending effort to sustain the company’s competitive edge.
“This is the trona capital of the world,” Castillon said over the hum of a mobile conveyor carrying rock to the surface. “I can see this mine going for another 50 to 100 years. Trona’s not going anywhere, as long as there’s a need for it.”

(Photo by Evan Houk/Maine Morning Star)The tax cut legislation that U.S. House of Representatives Republicans are putting together in Washington includes measures that will cost thousands of jobs in Wisconsin and undercut the state’s progress toward cleaner energy, according to environmental and labor advocates.
To help pay for the extension of tax cuts enacted in the first Trump administration, the GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee is proposing to repeal clean energy tax credits, Politico reported this week. The tax credits were among the measures enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
“These credits are not just numbers on a balance sheet out in Washington D.C,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in an online press conference Wednesday. “They are representing real jobs, real economic growth, and real progress towards Wisconsin’s sustainable energy infrastructure. Since the IRA was signed into law in 2022 we have seen an unprecedented boom in clean energy development in the trades.”
The press conference was hosted by Forward Together Wisconsin, a nonprofit established to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.
“We’ve been seeing this real opportunity to drive energy costs down, and I cannot for the life of me understand why people want to reverse that progress,” said former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, president of Forward Together Wisconsin.
In addition to the tax credits that the U.S. House proposal would repeal, President Donald Trump in his second term has frozen federal clean energy grants that were part of the 2022 legislation. Those include grants to establish a network of electric vehicle charging stations — prompting a lawsuit by 15 states, including Wisconsin.
Solar energy investments that have boomed in the last three years are among those that are threatened by the House proposal, according to advocates.
“At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement this week.
Since passage of the IRA, Wisconsin has seen $933 million in clean energy and transportation private-sector investments, along with just over $2 billion from federal grants and loans, according to Innovation Policy & Technology, a San Francisco climate change policy think tank. The organization tallied 61 new clean energy and transportation projects that got underway in the state, with 45 manufacturing American-made products.
“Lower investment and higher energy bills due to repealing these federal programs and tax incentives will cost nearly 5,200 Wisconsin jobs in 2030 and more than 6,400 jobs in 2035, compared to current policies,” Innovation Policy & Technology reported.
The advocacy group Climate Power has calculated that without the federal support $5.4 billion for 15 planned Wisconsin clean energy projects could be in jeopardy.
Of those projects, 12 — 80% — are in five congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Climate Power. Three representatives of those districts — Bryan Steil in the 1st CD, Scott Fitzgerald in the 5th CD and Glenn Grothman in the 6th CD — voted against the IRA in 2022. The other two, Derrick Van Orden in the 3rd CD and Tony Wied in the 8th CD, weren’t in office at the time but publicly opposed the legislation.
John Jacobs, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 494 in Southeast Wisconsin, said the clean energy tax credits and related policies have spurred investment and employment for the union’s members.
“I see first-hand how the clean energy tax credits have delivered on their promise, creating good family-sustaining union jobs across Wisconsin,” Jacobs said. “Repealing these tax credits could be devastating to many, but would put thousands of jobs at risk and hurt a growing industry.”
The tax credits were “an investment in America,” he added. The jobs lost if the credits are repealed “translate to economic instability for families across our state.”
The IRA also included a provision that extends the value of the tax credits to nonprofit organizations and government agencies.
Thanks to that benefit, called direct support payment, the Menasha Joint School District in the Fox Valley has qualified for a $4 million reimbursement from the federal government for installing rooftop solar energy and geothermal energy systems in a school currently under construction, said Brian Adesso, the school district’s business services director.
Once the school is complete the district expects to save $159,000 a year on its electric bill, “which is cost savings to local taxpayers and money that can be invested back into the students and staff,” Adesso said at the Forward Wisconsin press conference.
Adesso said the tax credits gave the district “certainty” it needed to be willing to undertake the clean energy additions to the project. Killing the credits would make that choice harder for school districts and impose higher costs on local property taxpayers, he added.
“The bill making its way through Congress takes a sledgehammer to the tax credits,” Addesso said — ending some credits early and attaching “bureaucratic restrictions that could make many of the credits unusable.”
Barnes said Forward Wisconsin Together is calling on Congress to protect the clean energy initiatives. “The people of Wisconsin deserve better,” he said. “The country deserves better. Clean energy as we know is the future, and we have to continue to invest in it.”

“We’re always thrilled to announce the opening of the aerial tram, because it marks the official beginning of summer at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort,” said Tim Mason, vice president of operations. “The tram is the highest point that many people will access in the Tetons. There are wonderful hiking opportunities and 360-degree views, and skiing is still available in the backcountry. We look forward to welcoming everyone back to experience the unique adventures our aerial tram offers.”
Following the tram‘s opening Saturday, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort‘s bike park, and a via ferrata rock climbing route, are scheduled to open in June, as conditions allow.  
Information about prices for tram rides, activities, weather and mountain conditions is available online at www.jacksonhole.com. Early season conditions and snow exist in the Teton Range. 
The tram is scheduled to operate daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Oct. 6.
Because the tram drops riders off at the top of a mountain above 10,000 feet in elevation, guests should be prepared with clothing, enough warm layers and appropriate footwear to remain warm and dry.

For more than three years, Tennessee reporters heard how they would “learn the truth” about how former House staffer Cade Cothren got the raw end of a deal when he was indicted on political corruption charges.
But when Cothren refused to testify on his own behalf and neither the defense nor the prosecution called House Speaker Cameron Sexton to the stand, we all went home wondering why we hadn’t heard the truth and, worse, why we spent hours covering this debacle of a trial. It’s not yielding much new information.
Jurors also had to be wondering why they gave up their lives for a month to sit through umpteen bench conferences and try to figure out whether Cothren and former House Speaker Glen Casada broke the law by keeping Phoenix Solutions’ operations secret to make $52,000, likely a pittance compared to the amount of money paid to defense attorneys and spent by the federal government to investigate and try this case.
This is a cautionary tale for those making $200,000 a year and suddenly losing it, as was Cothren’s case.
Cothren’s story was that he helped Sexton ascend to the speakership in late 2019 because he still had some pull with supporters of Casada, who stepped down from the speakership that August after a no-confidence vote. He requested the phone log he claims showed he was in constant communication with Sexton in 2019 before getting kicked to the curb. Meanwhile, Sexton cooperated with the FBI and was expected to be a star witness for the prosecution, while also being subpoenaed by the defense.
Court filing: Sexton likely wore a wire for federal investigators

He came out unscathed amid speculation fueled by defense attorneys that he or someone in his office wore a wire and recorded conversations with lawmakers. If so, the prosecution didn’t use them.
The defense didn’t call any witnesses, either, even though it subpoenaed half of the legislature to testify. The move raised questions about whether those in Casada’s camp wanted to be hammered by prosecutors, especially since most received chairmanships to back his ascension to the throne.
As the trial crawled into its 19th day Thursday, jurors in their third day of deliberation pored over dozens of pages of instructions and grew more confused by the minute, evidenced by questions they asked the court about how to apply the rules to 19 counts of fraud, bribery, kickbacks and conspiracy, creating more potential for confusion.
The judge and attorneys acknowledged they didn’t understand the jury’s Thursday question, thus were uncertain about how to answer it. The back-and-forth didn’t exactly engender confidence in the legal system.
In short, the court asked jurors to slide a camel through the eye of a needle, which someone said is as hard as it is for a rich man to give up all earthly possessions and follow Jesus.
“Is there anyone home?”
The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance dismissed a “collusion” complaint this week against Republican Sen. Bobby Harshbarger’s 2024 campaign in upper East Tennessee.
Sen. Ken Yager, chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus, asked for the dismissal after filing the complaint last year claiming the East Tennessee Conservatives PAC and Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger’s campaign illegally coordinated to support her son’s effort when he defeated incumbent Sen. Jon Lundberg of Bristol.
Apparently, all is forgiven.
Registry members Tom Lawless and Paige Burcham Dennis said last October the Registry should subpoena Thomas Datwyler, treasurer for the PAC and the congresswoman’s campaign, to answer questions and provide financial information after two groups poured $600,000 worth of dark money into the Republican primary.

The Registry sent out the demand, but the whole thing turned out to be a tempest in a teapot, when the Attorney General’s Office gave a half-hearted report on the matter and the Registry failed to hunt down the Wisconsin-based Datwyler to testify.
“It’s just one of those where nobody was here to prosecute it,” Lawless said at Tuesday’s Registry board meeting. He added that Yager’s request made the difference.
The Registry is seeking more funding from the legislature to add auditors and investigators, since the AG’s Office glossed over the matter and sent a message that it can’t be called on constantly to do the Registry’s legal work. But getting extra money from the legislature will be difficult, especially when the Registry’s job is to police it.
Staving off pain
Tennessee is set to resume executions May 22, after Gov. Bill Lee called for a hiatus because of questions about the protocol for drugs used to kill people.
A group of death row prisoners filed a challenge in Davidson County Chancery Court to the state’s request for a protective order to keep secret information about lethal injection chemicals and qualifications and training of executioners. 
Suddenly things are moving rapidly because Oscar Franklin Smith, 75, is set to die next week by lethal injection for the 1989 murders of his estranged wife and her two sons. The execution date comes three years after his death was postponed when Gov. Bill Lee ordered a halt because prison staff failed to test lethal injection drugs properly to see if they were contaminated.
They say the state is purposely using drugs with the risk of being “adulterated and lacking in potency, and which will very likely cause superadded pain and suffering.”
Tennessee is planning to use manufactured pentobarbital for the executions, a point the inmates say is significant because no commercial manufacturer will sell the drug to departments of correction for executions.
Bill to allow public access to lethal injection records on the rocks after state lobbies against it

Their attorney, Kelley Henry, said if the Department of Correction were buying execution chemicals from “legitimate” suppliers and ensuring purity and potency and using properly trained personnel to handle executions, the state wouldn’t need “a veil of secrecy.”
“This means that the pentobarbital Tennessee has acquired was obtained on the gray market,” which is “inherently risky,” according to the inmates’ release.
A trial is set for Jan. 12, 2026 because the state said it couldn’t be ready sooner.
But the governor doesn’t appear ready to postpone the Smith execution again.
According to spokesperson Elizabeth Johnson, “As Gov. Lee has said, he believes the death penalty is a serious matter and an appropriate punishment for the most heinous crimes; it’s why he instructed the Tennessee Department of Correction to conduct a thorough review of the lethal injection protocol to leave no question that lawful and effective procedures are followed. The governor thoroughly reviews each case and has full confidence in the Department’s ability to oversee this process in compliance with the revised protocol.”
We’re glad someone has confidence in the Department of Correction.
“When she squeezed me tight …”
The ACLU of Tennessee and Holland & Associates are challenging the state’s refusal to issue driver’s licenses and state ID documents to transgender residents reflecting their gender change.
“Our clients need accurate identification documents in order to travel for work and family, to vote, and to engage in everyday life like everyone else. Forcing them to carry identification that contradicts who they are — or else withholding that identification altogether — is cruel, unfair and unlawful,” ACLU-TN senior attorney Lucas Cameron-Vaughn said in a statement.
Two unnamed transgender women claim their lives have been disrupted, putting them at risk for more discrimination, harassment and possible violence.
One of the women said the Department of Safety and Homeland Security ordered her to surrender her license or have her driving privileges revoked. A Davidson County judge stopped that move.

It’s not clear why the legislature and state are so concerned about people’s sexual preferences, other than to maintain a constant barrage of culture skirmishes.
Consider this question: Does transgender status affect a person’s ability to drive a car? Probably not.
The state should be more concerned about those yahoos driving motorcycles 150 mph and scaring the crap out of everybody on the road. 
But in their infinite wisdom they’re putting more resources into deporting immigrants, forcing businesses to shut down and cracking down on transgender folks. And for what?
Recycled governor
Proving that you’re never too old to go to the office, former Gov. Bill Haslam is set to start serving on the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees, thanks to an appointment by House Speaker Sexton.
The Haslam family name is all over the UT system, mainly the Knoxville campus, so this isn’t exactly shocking. 
Sexton cited Haslam’s role in starting the Tennessee Promise for community colleges and technical schools and the Drive to 55, whose goal is for 55% of Tennesseans to hold some sort of education certificate or degree.
Don’t confuse that with Sammy Haggar’s “I Can’t Drive 55,” because nobody’s doing it unless police officers are standing on the side of the road with a radar detector.
The bigger question is whether Haslam will encourage UT President Randy Boyd to run for governor again or at least to buck President Trump and re-up the DEI program.

Glen who?
In case some folks wonder if the people of the great state of Tennessee, from Mountain City to Memphis, remember Glen Casada, let it be known at least one person does. That’s based on the F-bomb a motorist dropped on the former lawmaker when he walked up to the federal courthouse afternoon last week.
Welcome home, Mr. Speaker.

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Federal prosecutors sought a maximum prison sentence of nearly 20 years for the CEO of Pain MD, a company found to have given hundreds of thousands of questionable injections to patients, many reliant on opioids. It would have been among the longest sentences for a health care executive convicted of fraud in recent years.
Instead, he got 18 months.
Michael Kestner, 73, who was convicted of 13 fraud felonies last year, faced at least a decade behind bars based on federal sentencing guidelines. He was granted the substantially lightened sentence due to his age and health Wednesday during a federal court hearing in Nashville.
U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger described Kestner as a “ruthless businessman” who funded a “lavish lifestyle” by turning medical professionals into “puppets” who pressured patients into injections that did not help their pain and sometimes made it worse.
“In the court’s eyes, he knew it was wrong, and he didn’t really care if it was doing anyone any good,” Trauger said.
But Trauger also said she was swayed by defense arguments that Kestner would struggle in federal prison due to his age and medical conditions, including the blood disorder hemochromatosis. Trauger said she had concerns about prison health care after considering about 200 requests for compassionate release in other court cases.
“The medical care at these facilities,” defense attorney Peter Strianse said, “has always been dodgy and suspect.”
Kestner did not speak at the court hearing, other than to detail his medical conditions. He did not respond to questions as he left the courthouse.
Pain clinics made millions from ‘unnecessary’ injections into ‘human pin cushions’

Pain MD ran as many as 20 clinics in Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina throughout much of the 2010s. While many doctors were scaling back their use of prescription painkillers due to the opioid crisis, Pain MD paired opioids with monthly injections into patients’ backs, claiming the shots could ease pain and potentially lessen reliance on pills, according to federal court documents.
During Kestner’s October trial, the Department of Justice proved that the injections were part of a decade-long scheme that defrauded Medicare and other insurance programs of millions of dollars by capitalizing on patients’ dependence on opioids.
The DOJ successfully argued at trial that Pain MD’s “unnecessary and expensive injections” were largely ineffective because they targeted the wrong body part, contained short-lived numbing medications but no steroids, and appeared to be based on test shots given to cadavers — people who felt neither pain nor relief because they were dead. During closing arguments, the DOJ argued Pain MD had turned some patients into “human pin cushions.”
“They were leaned over a table and repeatedly injected in their spine,” federal prosecutor Katherine Payerle said during the May 14 sentencing hearing. “Over and over, month after month, at the direction of Mr. Kestner.”
At last year’s trial, witnesses testified that Kestner was the driving force behind the injections, which amounted to roughly 700,000 shots over about eight years, with some patients receiving up to 24 at once.
Four former patients testified that they tolerated the shots out of fear that Pain MD otherwise would have cut off their painkiller prescriptions, without which they might have spiraled into withdrawal.
One of those patients, Michelle Shaw, told KFF Health News that the injections sometimes left her in so much pain she had to use a wheelchair. She was outraged by Kestner’s sentence.
“I’m disgusted that all they got was a slap on the wrist as far as I’m concerned,” Shaw said May 14. “I hope karma comes back to him. That he suffers to his last breath.”

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)When he was campaigning for Congress in western Wisconsin, Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden talked about growing up “in abject rural poverty,” raised by a single mom who relied on food stamps. As a result, he has said, he would never go along with cuts to food assistance. 
“He sat down in my office when he first got elected and promised me he wouldn’t ever vote against SNAP because he grew up on it, supposedly,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan said in a phone interview as he was on his way home to Wisconsin from Washington this week.
But as Henry Redman reported, Van Orden voted for the Republican budget blueprint, which proposes more than $200 billion in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in order to make room for tax cuts for the very wealthy.
Still, after that vote, Van Orden issued a public statement warning against reckless cuts to SNAP that place “disproportionate burdens on rural states, where food insecurity is often more widespread,” and saying it is unfair to build a budget “on the backs of some of our most vulnerable populations, including hungry children. Period.”
Van Orden sits on the House Agriculture Committee, which was tasked with drawing up a specific plan to cut $230 billion from food assistance to pay for tax cuts. Van Orden reportedly balked at a cost-sharing plan that shifted 25% of the cost of the program to states, saying it was unfair to Wisconsin.
But then, on Wednesday night, Van Orden voted yes as the committee passed an unprecedented cut in federal funding for SNAP on a 29-25 vote.
Van Orden took credit for the plan, which ties cuts to state error rates in determining eligibility and benefit amounts for food assistance. According to WisPolitics, he declared at a House Ag Committee markup that “states are going to have to accept the fact that if they are not administering this program efficiently, that they’re going to have to pay a portion of the program that is equitable, and it makes sense and it is scaled.” 
But states, including Wisconsin, don’t have money to make up the gap as the federal government, for the first time ever, withdraws hundreds of millions of dollars for nutrition assistance. Instead, they will reduce coverage, kick people off the program and hunger will increase. The ripple effects include a loss of about $30 billion for farmers who supply food for the program, Democrats on the Ag Committee report, and damage to the broader economy, since every $1 in SNAP benefits generates about $1.50 in economic activity. Grocery stores, food manufacturers rural communities will be hit particularly hard. 
Wisconsin will start out with a bill for 5% of the costs of the program in Fiscal Year 2028, according to a bill explanation from the Agriculture Committee. But as error rates vary, that number shifts sharply upward — to 15% when the error rate goes from the current 5% to 6%, to 20% if we exceed an 8% error rate, and so on.  
And there are other cuts in the bill, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) points out, including stricter eligibility limits, work requirements that cannot be waived in times of economic hardship and high unemployment, and reductions in benefits that come from eliminating deductions for utility costs. 
More than 900,000 children, adults, and seniors count on Wisconsin’s SNAP program, known as FoodShare, according to an analysis of state health department data by Kids Forward. The same analysis found that covering the costs of just 10% of SNAP benefits would cost Wisconsin $136 million. 
Alaska and Texas have higher error rates than Wisconsin, and so they — and their hungry kids — are stuck with the biggest cuts. Even if you accept that that is somehow just, the people who are going to pay for this bill in all the states, including ours, are, as Van Orden himself put it, “the most vulnerable populations, including hungry children. Period.”
“He says one thing and does another,” Pocan says of Van Orden’s flip-flopping on SNAP. “He’s gone totally Washington.”
That’s too bad for the people left behind in rural Wisconsin, who will take the brunt of these unnecessary cuts.

(Mario Tama | Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.











Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project



During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
Restorative justice models
In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
Calls for a cultural shift on expectations
While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.











Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.



Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Budgets are not just about money – they also reflect the values and priorities of a state and country. That is especially true now as the Republican-controlled Congress considers the “big, beautiful” tax cut bill President Trump wants approved.
If the final bill contains the tax cuts and budget cuts currently under consideration, it will be the largest tax cut in American history and one of the biggest program cuts in the history of the country as well. It would call for tax cuts of about $4.5 trillion — yes, that’s trillion – and billions of dollars in budget cuts to programs that benefit millions of Americans.
Even though most Americans will get something from the tax cuts, 45 percent of the tax savings will go to Americans earning more than $450,000 per year, according to the independent Tax Policy Center. 
Another study by the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania estimated that the lowest 80 percent of taxpayers would get 29 percent of the tax cuts, while the top 10 percent of income taxpayers would get 56 percent. 
The Tax Policy Center study said about 13 percent of middle-income families would see a tax increase with the plans currently under consideration. The greatest benefit families would receive is the extension of the current $2,000 per child tax credit which might even increase to $2,500. Even that benefit would be cut in half if Congress doesn’t act this year.
To help offset some — yet not all — of the cost of the tax cuts, Congress is looking to cut $1 billion from programs that benefit the most vulnerable Americans, especially children. They are looking at cutting or making it more difficult for low-income families to qualify for Medicaid, they are looking at cutting $230 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) which 40 million Americans rely on for food. Even the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides health care for a third to more than 40 percent of children in 43 of Idaho’s 44 counties could be impacted. 
Idaho’s counties are already feeling the financial pinch of the Trump administration and Congress cutting funding for the Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Program. For example, Valley County will lose $1.3 million for schools, road projects, and suppression projects, according to the McCall Star-News. 
Under the Republican Congress’ plan, the biggest cuts would come from the Medicaid program, which would have a major negative impact on millions of Americans and Idahoans.
One in five Americans – 20 percent – get their health care through Medicaid. In 2024, more than 322,353 Idahoans received Medicaid support, including three out of every eight children, according to KFF, a nonprofit health group. The reliance on Medicaid is especially high in rural Idaho where a quarter of citizens rely on the program. 
Congress also has plans to cut Medicaid payments to public schools, which are used to provide mental health support and other support for students. This will especially affect Idaho where we have one of the highest youth suicide rates in the country, according to Mental Health America.
But the Trump-GOP Congress plan will not just impact vulnerable Idahoans and other citizens. It will drive up the federal budget deficit by trillions of dollars, according to the independent Tax Foundation. The added interest on that debt will reduce the standard of living for Americans by at least one percent, offsetting part of the tax cut benefits, the Tax Foundation said.  
To make matters worse, the Trump administration and Congress are looking to provide a $5 billion dollar-for-dollar tax credit for high income taxpayers to provide vouchers for private and religious schools. This voucher program will not only increase the federal deficit and provide an attractive tax shelter for high income taxpayers, but it will also undermine our already underfunded public schools in Idaho by providing a federal subsidy to competing private and religious schools.
One proposal is to reduce federal matching funds for states that have expanded their Medicaid programs to support working families who can’t afford health care on limited paychecks. In Idaho, 90,000 Idahoans receive health care under the Medicaid expansion program approved by voters a few years ago.
Amid protests and Democratic pushback, U.S. House GOP launches work on Medicaid cuts

If federal funding for Medicaid expansion is reduced and the state doesn’t pick up the added cost, these 90,000 Idahoans could lose their health insurance. If that happens, uninsured Idahoans would be one serious illness or accident away from financial ruin.
Moreover, the only place uninsured Idahoans could go for care is to the emergency room at local hospitals which would double or even triple the cost of their care. In the view of one Idaho health leader, such a scenario would be financially “catastrophic” for Idaho hospitals, especially in rural communities where so many Medicaid recipients live.
One idea is to require all Medicaid recipients to work. But a study by KFF shows that most recipients already work. 
The political challenge Republican members of Congress face is that up to 25 million Republicans are on Medicaid, according to KFF. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon was quoted in The Washington Post as saying that “a lot of MAGA’s on Medicaid.” Even House Speaker Mike Johnson has one of the highest percentages of constituents on public health insurance, according to the Post.
Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley wrote in The New York Times this week that it would be political suicide for Republicans to cut Medicaid. He said the party would be responsible for the closure of rural hospitals that could not survive the cuts or the added expense of treating people in their emergency rooms. He warned that it would “represent the end of any chance of us becoming the working-class party.” 
Meanwhile, you wouldn’t know it because he doesn’t advertise it, but Idaho’s own senior Sen. Mike Crapo, who chairs the powerful Senate Finance Committee, will be a key player in what the final tax and spending cut bill looks like. On May 9, Politico quoted Crapo as saying he has concerns about cutting Medicaid and SNAP programs. 
“I’m not excited about the proposal, but I have to say, there are a number of people in both the House and the Senate who are, and if the president weighs in favor of it, then that’s going to be a big factor that we have to take into consideration as well,” Crapo said in an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt, according to Politico.
Politico said Crapo has been an outspoken advocate for essentially writing off the cost of permanently extending the tax cuts and accounting only for any new tax provisions. That is surprising since Crapo has made a career of calling for reducing the federal budget deficit. 
What Idahoans need to know in this complicated dance over tax and budget cuts is this: Half or more of the tax cuts will benefit more economically affluent taxpayers and most of the budget cuts will be on the backs of low-income Americans, including thousands in Idaho.
Furthermore, the “big, beautiful bill,” as President Trump describes it, will do nothing to reduce the $36 trillion-dollar federal debt. In fact, it is likely to make the deficit even bigger, leaving the mess for our kids and grandkids to clean up someday. 
All so the most affluent taxpayers can receive a “big, beautiful” tax cut.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections on Thursday chose a partnership between Arkansas and Kansas City-based firms to build a proposed new 3,000-bed prison.
In a special-called meeting via videoconference, the seven-member board unanimously accepted the recommendation of its selection committee to negotiate a final contract with the partnership of Nabholz Construction of Conway and J.E. Dunn Construction of Kansas City, Missouri. Board Chairman Benny Magness said he expects to appoint a negotiating team by the board’s regular meeting on May 29.
The choice of a general contractor for the new prison marks the latest step in getting the prison off the ground since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in March 2023 her intent to have the state build the mega-prison. Last October, the prison board hired California-based Vanir Construction Management as project manager for the prison. In April, the board chose Omaha, Neb.-based HDR and Little Rock-based Cromwell Architects Engineers as the design team for the 3,000-bed facility.
Nabholz and J.E. Dunn both have extensive experience constructing correctional facilities, their representatives said Thursday. Dunn built a 2,552-bed prison in Tennessee that took 16 months to finish and was completed in 2015, according to its website. Nabholz has a 30-year history of working on Department of Corrections projects, said Jon Pahl, vice president of preconstruction.
Board members were careful Thursday not to specify where the prison will be located; the motion to approve the contractor said only that the firms would be hired for “the new prison build.”

The planned prison became controversial last fall when Sanders announced on Oct. 31 that the state was buying 815 acres in rural Franklin County for $2.95 million on which to place the prison. Local officials and some lawmakers cried foul, saying they had been “blindsided” by the decision. At least two citizen groups formed to voice objections to the site because of its remote location, which they said would make it difficult and expensive to provide adequate infrastructure and staffing.
A bill to appropriate $750 million toward the prison project stalled in the last days of the General Assembly last month as lawmakers voiced concerns about the ultimate cost and continued to raise questions about the suitability of the Franklin County location. Administration officials provided an estimated cost of the project of $825 million, but opponents said it could cost upward of $1 billion.
In a letter to Sanders the day the legislative session ended this month, Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, asked the governor to use previously appropriated prison funds for their originally intended purpose —expanding the prison at Calico Rock — and taking other steps to increase state prison capacity instead of sticking to the Franklin County proposal.
King was accompanied at a press conference that day by about 20 opponents of the west Arkansas prison site as well as members of the Chickamauga, an Indigenous tribe with a presence in Franklin County. Tribal officials called for an archaeological study before construction begins because of potential artifacts and burial sites in the area. The state hasn’t committed to a formal study but has said it is conducting an assessment of the site for potential archaeological evidence.
The prison board took care of other matters at Thursday’s special meeting, including approving the purchase of 23 TruNarc drug-testing devices for $822,000. The corrections department has been using one of the devices and sharing among its facilities. An official said it is more accurate than previous drug-testing methods.
The board also approved the purchase of 70 new Arkansas Wireless Information Network two-way radios to replace older ones at a cost of $166,000 and 10 zero-turn mowers for $107,000.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s 2025 legislative session exposed some sharp fault lines within the Democratic Party when it comes to labor issues.
Though Democrats hold solid majorities in both the state Senate and the House of Representatives, measures backed by progressive lawmakers to protect workers from extreme heat and to prohibit the use of surveillance-based algorithms to set wages were among the bills that died in the face of opposition from moderates.
The session’s biggest priority for labor groups, a bill aimed at making it easier for workers to unionize, made it through both chambers of the Legislature but is expected to be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis at the behest of business groups. The party’s progressive and moderate wings clashed over several other proposals, including a bitter fight over changes to tipped minimum wage laws.
Here are the major labor bills lawmakers enacted before adjourning their regular legislative session on May 7.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Worker Protection Act
Senate Bill 25-5 would repeal the state’s Labor Peace Act, a 1943 law that erected a unique obstacle to workers seeking to form a union in Colorado.
Under the law, unionizing workers, after winning a simple majority vote to form a union, must hold a second election and obtain 75% approval to negotiate so-called union security — a requirement that all represented workers pay dues, even if they don’t support the union. The Labor Peace Act is effectively a modified version of the so-called “right to work” rules enacted by many conservative states.
Democratic majorities in the Legislature approved SB-5, dubbed the Worker Protection Act. But Polis said earlier this year that he would only sign the bill if it met the approval of business groups like the Colorado Chamber of Commerce. When talks between the two sides stalled, lawmakers passed SB-5 anyway.
Polis has indicated he will veto the bill. He has until June 6 to do so. Labor leaders have vowed to revive the Worker Protection Act next year.
Local tipped minimum wages
As originally introduced, House Bill 25-1208 would have meant steep wage cuts for tipped workers in Denver and Boulder, forcing those cities to dramatically increase their “tip credits” — the dollar amount that employers can subtract from the minimum wage paid to tipped workers, as long as tips make up the difference.
The bill’s sponsors, Denver Democratic Reps. Steven Woodrow and Alex Valdez, pitched the wage cuts as necessary relief for a struggling restaurant industry. But they backed off that plan after intense pushback from labor and progressive groups and a series of long, contentious committee hearings at the Capitol.
Instead, the amended version of HB-1208 would allow, but not require, local governments to increase their tip credits. In theory, a local government could raise the minimum wage for non-tipped employees as high as it wished, while maintaining a tipped minimum wage of $11.79 an hour, the statewide minimum.
Polis has not yet taken action on the bill.
Wage theft crackdown
House Bill 25-1001 would make a variety of changes aimed at combating wage theft, including raising the cap on wage-theft claims from $7,500 to $13,000, streamlining the process of adjudicating claims and increasing penalties on employers for repeated and “willful violations” of the law.
“Colorado workers lose hundreds of millions of dollars per year in wages due to theft from bad-acting employers,” Sen. Chris Kolker, a Centennial Democrat and HB-1001 sponsor, said in a statement on the bill’s passage. “With this legislation, Colorado’s labor force would more quickly and easily access their owed wages so they are fairly compensated for the work they do.”
The bill was approved by Democrats on party-line votes in the House and Senate. Polis has yet to take action on the bill.
Rollback of farmworker protections
Senate Bill 25-128 would repeal a provision in state law guaranteeing access by “key service providers” — including medical personnel, attorneys, legal advocates and clergy — to farmworkers on private agricultural properties during off hours. That protection was passed by Democratic majorities in the Legislature in 2021 as part of a larger piece of legislation known as the Farmworkers Bill of Rights.
Sponsors, including Democratic Sen. Dylan Roberts of Avon and Republican Sen. Byron Pelton of Sterling, said the “cleanup bill” was needed after a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that found a similar access provision enacted in California unconstitutional. The bill would leave intact the vast majority of the wide-ranging 2021 farmworkers’ rights measure.
Some farmworker advocates opposed SB-128, arguing the law’s protections for health care provider access weren’t covered by the Supreme Court ruling and should be left in place. The bill passed with bipartisan support, with a handful of progressive Democrats in both chambers opposed. Polis has not yet taken action on it.
Prohibiting non-compete agreements for medical workers
Senate Bill 25-83 would extend Colorado’s prohibition on “restrictive employment agreements,” including non-solicitation and non-compete agreements, to cover physicians, dentists and advanced practice nurses.
Those professions would no longer be included in the category of “highly compensated workers” that are exempted from the non-compete ban under current law. Bipartisan majorities in the Legislature approved SB-83, with a handful of Republicans opposed.
Polis has yet to take action on the bill.

(Marty Schladen | Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio History Connection last week laid off a third of the staff at the State Office of Historic Preservation. Even though many of its responsibilities are mandated by the federal government, the feds haven’t provided funding that was appropriated in October, a spokesman said.
The money is provided by the National Park Service, which has been hammered by staffing and funding cuts from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
The historic preservation office handles Ohio listings on the National Register of Historic Places, historic preservation tax incentives, and maintains a permanent record of Ohio’s historic buildings and sites, in addition to many other responsibilities.
The Ohio History Connection, which oversees the preservation office, laid off 12 of its employees because it hasn’t received $1.448 million from the National Park Service despite the fact that the money was appropriated on Oct. 1, said Neil Thompson, the history connection’s manager of media and public relations.
In a note to history connection staff last week, Executive Director and CEO Megan Wood said the preservation office couldn’t maintain its staffing without the money.
“As a reminder, roughly 60% of (the preservation office’s) funding comes from the federal Historic Preservation Fund — administered by the National Park Service and supported by proceeds from offshore oil and gas leases,” Wood wrote. “Although these funds were appropriated for the current federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2024, they have not yet been released.
“We have been working tirelessly with the Governor’s Office, our Board, and Ohio’s Congressional Delegation to advocate for the timely release of these funds. However, with the majority of our (historic preservation) budget allocated to personnel, we are unable to sustain our current staffing levels without this federal support.”
In 1966, Congress passed the National Historic Preservation Act after years of mass demolition of historic sites and buildings.
“By the mid-1960s, federally-funded infrastructure and urban renewal projects had resulted in the rapid destruction of places significant in the nation’s history,” the National Park Service says on its website. “Congress recognized that the federal government’s historic preservation program was inadequate to ensure that future generations could appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of the nation. (The National Historic Preservation Act) was enacted in recognition that historic places were being lost or altered, and that preservation was in the public’s interest.”
Among the things created under the law was the National Register of Historic Places, on which Columbus’s German Village has been listed since 1974.
Workers in state preservation offices evaluate whether nominees make the register. Those decisions depend on how old they are, their historical significance, their architectural significance, and other factors, Thompson said.
“It’s a federal program — a federal list that is ultimately put out by the Department of the Interior — but the State Historic Preservation Office is responsible for reviewing nominations to ensure all these factors are met,” Thompson said.
A more complete description of the preservation office’s responsibilities can be found here.
Some developers and homeowners might balk at historic preservation requirements, but historic preservation is popular with the public. For example, a 2014 UCLA survey found that “88% of respondents believe that historic places should be treated as community assets… (and) 83% of respondents indicated that historic preservation is somewhat to very important.”
The agency has been buffeted with cuts and threats of more since Trump took office and put the world’s richest man in charge of cutting government services.
In February, 1,000 probationary employees were cut from the park service and another 700 took buyouts. Now the Trump administration is planning to cut 1,500 more. The cuts already are said to have sewn chaos at the agency.
“Pending financial assistance obligations, including grants, are under review for compliance with recent executive orders and memoranda,” the park service said Wednesday in an email. “We will be happy to provide you with an update when we have additional information to share.”
Despite the loss of personnel at Ohio’s State Historic Preservation Office, officials plan to continue doing what the law requires.
“Despite this setback, we remain responsible for fulfilling our federally mandated duties, including the administration of the National Register of Historic Places, the Federal Historic Tax Credit program, and compliance reviews under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act,” Wood, CEO of the History Connection, told employees.
“We know the coming months will be challenging, and that extended processing times may occur as we adjust to these changes. Nonetheless, we remain committed to our mission and to serving the people and communities of Ohio through the preservation of our shared heritage.”

(Getty Images)Provisional data shows that overdose deaths in West Virginia declined by an astonishing 43.5% in the last year. Nationally, overdose deaths fell 27% over the same period, the largest one-year decline ever. While researchers are still analyzing the data, declines in overdose deaths have coincided with increased Medicaid coverage for substance use disorder treatment, with West Virginia leading the way in using Medicaid and the federal dollars it brings into the state to address our people’s needs and improve overdose outcomes. But those gains will be stalled or even reversed if the Medicaid provisions in Congress’ reconciliation package are made law — taking away the most effective tool we have to save lives and help our people recover from tens of thousands of West Virginians. 
Medicaid funding plays a critical role in West Virginia’s efforts to treat substance use disorder and prevent overdose deaths. The Mountain State was the first in the nation to receive approval under the Trump Administration in 2017 to use flexibilities within the Medicaid program to provide substance use treatment. Now, Medicaid is the main source of health coverage for opioid use disorder, covering more than half of all adults receiving medication for opioid use disorder and two-thirds of those receiving outpatient treatment and peer support services.
The Medicaid expansion, the portion of the program that is most directly under threat in the proposal moving through Congress, has given many West Virginians who struggle with addiction their first real opportunity to access the treatment they need. Nearly three-fourths of West Virginians who receive treatment for substance use disorder are covered through the Medicaid expansion, and one study found that, even after controlling for other policies to address substance use disorder, expansion states have seen a much larger reduction in overdose deaths (9.5%) than non-expansion states. 
The Medicaid proposals currently under consideration in Congress would dramatically reduce access to treatment for those who need it most and undermine the historic progress made over the last year. 
They increase paperwork, red tape and out-of-pocket costs that will result in many adults, including those with substance use disorder, losing their health coverage. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates  more than 10 million Americans would be kicked off Medicaid if this package were enacted, with a separate analysis estimating 55,000 here in West Virginia. 
One piece, implementing work reporting requirements, would kick some adults off Medicaid if they do not submit proof showing they are working or qualify for an exemption, even though the vast majority of West Virginians do fall under one of those categories. Work requirements pose a particular challenge for adults with substance use disorder, for whom being in active treatment is often a prerequisite for them to secure work. And while the legislative proposal instructs that adults who are considered medically frail, which includes having a chronic substance use disorder, should be exempt from these requirements, proving one qualifies for an exemption is also a complex multi-step process that often results in eligible people losing coverage. Time spent on reporting compliance takes away from therapy compliance, creating a new barrier to recovery. 
Another component of the legislation would require states to impose cost-sharing on Medicaid expansion adults that could be as high as $35 per service. Research shows that co-pays cause individuals who need care to forgo it. Applying such a disincentive to ongoing treatment for individuals with chronic conditions like substance use disorder would undermine our health goals and could result in backsliding on recovery.
Each of these policies result in people losing their health coverage, not because they fail to meet the requirements, but because the new paperwork and multi-step processes are confusing, burdensome, and difficult to follow. When Arkansas implemented Medicaid work reporting requirements for a short period in 2018, one-quarter of those subject to the new requirements lost their health coverage in the first six months alone, despite the fact that researchers found nearly everyone who lost their coverage was working or should have received an exemption. Regardless, a substantial portion of the population had difficulty navigating the process so complex researchers found that, if left in place, 97% of enrollees would be deemed ineligible over time for failing to meet paperwork requirements. 
Medicaid — and the Medicaid expansion specifically — is the strongest tool in our arsenal to address substance use disorder. Over the last year, those investments have shown significant progress with the largest decline in overdose deaths in history, with West Virginia leading the way. Cuts to Medicaid like those Congress is currently considering would undermine that progress, hurt West Virginia families and cost lives.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Medicaid-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 06:01:45.425976

This story originally appeared in Stateline.
Local sheriffs are on the front lines in deciding whether to participate in the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans. But states increasingly are making the choice for them.
More and more, sheriffs’ hands are tied no matter whether they do — or don’t — want to help with deportations, though they often get the blame when conservatives draw up lists of sanctuary cities.
“‘Naughty lists,’ as we call them, are not super helpful here,” said Patrick Royal, a spokesperson for the National Sheriffs’ Association. “We all know there are places like Colorado where you can’t (help with deportations), and places like North Carolina where you have to.”
Cooperation between sheriffs and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement lies at the heart of the Trump administration’s immigration detention policy. The administration plans to punish noncooperative jurisdictions with funding cuts — though many legal experts agree that cooperation is voluntary unless state or local laws say otherwise.

Sheriffs, who typically run local jails, must decide what to do when faced with immigration detainers — requests from ICE to hold onto incarcerated people up to two extra days so ICE officers can show up and arrest them. ICE issues those detainers when the agency reviews fingerprints sent electronically for background checks as part of the jail booking process.
Otherwise, arrested suspects who post bond or are otherwise released by a judge might go free despite their immigration status, prompting ICE in some cases to pursue them in the community.
In North Carolina, Sheriff Garry McFadden ran on a platform of limiting cooperation with ICE  when he was elected in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, in 2018. But today, McFadden must comply with detainers because of a state law passed last year.
In a now-retracted Facebook post, U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis in late April accused Mecklenburg and several other North Carolina counties of “shielding criminal illegal immigrants” as sanctuary jurisdictions. Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said in the post he was writing federal legislation to prosecute sanctuary jurisdictions.
“You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both,” McFadden said. He added that he’d like more choice about whether to comply with detainers. A federal funding cutoff would endanger important jail programs such as rape counseling, he said.
“Everybody’s focused on immigration like that’s the biggest fire, and nobody wants to address the other things. The losers will be the prisoners who need all these services we provide,” McFadden said.










You can’t say we’re a sanctuary county and have state laws that say we have to work with ICE. You can’t have both.

Conservative sheriffs in Democratic-controlled states also can be frustrated by state policy on detainers. Sheriff Lew Evangelidis of Worcester County, Massachusetts, said he’s been criticized for releasing prisoners wanted by ICE but sometimes has no choice: A 2017 state Supreme Court ruling prohibits holding prisoners based on detainers.
“If (ICE wants) this person and consider them a threat to public safety, then I want that person out of my community. I want to keep my community safe,” said Evangelidis. He supported a Republican-sponsored effort in the state legislature to allow 12-hour holds for ICE if a judge determines the prisoner is a threat to public safety, but the amendment was voted down in April.
States act on detainers
Many experts agree that ICE detainers can be legally ignored if states allow sheriffs to do that.
“That detainer request is just that, a request, it’s not a requirement,” said Cassandra Charles, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is opposing Louisiana’s lawsuit to reverse a court-ordered ban on cooperation between Orleans Parish and ICE.
The general counsel for the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association, Eddie Caldwell, agreed that the detainers are voluntary under federal law.
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

The association supports a state bill now under consideration that would require not only the 48-hour detention but also a notice sent 48 hours before release to let ICE know the clock is running. The proposal has passed the House.
The notification matters, Caldwell said, because there can be criminal proceedings that take weeks or months, so ICE in many cases doesn’t realize the 48-hour window has started.
Tillis’ office said the senator’s disagreement with McFadden, a Democrat, and other sheriffs is about that notification.
“It’s not necessarily that (sheriffs) are breaking the law, but rather making it as difficult as possible for ICE to take prisoners into custody by refusing to do some basic things. Notification is important,” said Daniel Keylin, a senior adviser to Tillis.
States including California, Colorado and Massachusetts ban compliance with the ICE detainers, on the general principle that it’s not enough reason to hold people in jails when they’re otherwise free to go because of bail or an end to their criminal cases. Those three states have made recent moves to defend or fine-tune their rules.
California’s attorney general also has issued guidance to local jurisdictions based on a 2017 state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities. That law withstood a court challenge under the first Trump administration.
Colorado has a law against holding prisoners more than six hours longer than required, and a new bill sent to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis last week would specify that even those six hours can’t be for the purpose of an immigration detainer.
Iowa, Tennessee and Texas are among the states requiring cooperation with detainers.
And Florida has gone further, requiring sheriffs to actively help ICE write detainers though official agreements in which local agencies sign up to help enforce immigration laws.
Cooperation boosts arrests
Such cooperation makes a big difference, experts say — jails are the easiest place to pick up immigrants for deportation, and when local sheriffs and police help out, there are more arrests.
“A larger share of ICE arrests and deportations are happening in places where local law enforcement is cooperative with ICE,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director for the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program, speaking at a recent webinar.
“A declining share of arrests and deportations are happening from places like California, where there are really strict limitations on local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE,” she added.
ICE is making about 600 immigration arrests daily, twice the rate as during the last year of the Biden administration, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, speaking at the same event.
Reports on deportations are incomplete, Chishti said, but he estimated the current administration is on track to deport half a million people this year and is trying to get that number higher.
“The Trump administration has not been able to change the laws that are on the books, because only Congress can do that,” Chishti said. “It’s going to take congressional action for the Trump administration to achieve its aim of higher (arrest and deportation) numbers.”
President Donald Trump has added more pressure, last month requesting a list from Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of sanctuary cities, which he says would face funding cuts. The administration also has sued some states, including Colorado, Illinois and New York, over their policies.
Asked for comment on the legality of funding cutoffs for sanctuary policies, Bondi’s office referred to a February memo in which she promised to “end funding to state and local jurisdictions that unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement operations.” The memo cites a federal law saying local officials “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict” communication about immigration status.
Local jurisdictions in Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington joined a February lawsuit led by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California against a Trump administration executive order calling for defunding cities with sanctuary policies, calling the order “illegal and authoritarian.”
In April, a U.S. district court in California issued a preliminary injunction in that case preventing any funding cutoff over sanctuary policies to the cities and counties in the lawsuit. And on Friday, the federal judge, William Orrick, ruled that the injunction applies to any list of sanctuary jurisdictions the administration may target for funding cuts.
Trump’s new executive order seeking the list cannot be used as “an end run” around Orrick’s injunction, the judge wrote, while he decides the legality of detainer policies and other issues.
“The litigation may not proceed with the coercive threat to end all federal funding hanging over the Cities and Counties’ heads like the sword of Damocles,” Orrick wrote.

(Courtesy: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)As New Jersey-Based Holtec International works its way toward restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in West Michigan, a host of organizations are challenging regulator’s findings that reviving the reactor would not bring significant harm to the environment. 
The Palisades restart marks the first effort of its kind in the United States, with the federal government awarding the effort a $1.5 billion loan alongside $150 million in state funding to bring the facility back online. 
However the effort is not without its detractors, as some environmental organizations have argued against providing state funding for the effort, while other organizations have opposed the plant over safety and environmental concerns. 
In a virtual hearing Thursday morning, attorneys representing Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, Michigan Safe Energy Future, Three Mile Island Alert, and Nuclear Energy Information Services asked a panel Atomic Safety and Licensing Board panel to accept a motion allowing them to file new and updated contentions. Those contentions argue the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission erred when it issued a finding of no significant impact for the project, allowing it to forgo a full review of environmental impacts.
“The position of the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] staff seems to be that, since the plant was operable in May 2022 that simply a return to operability means that there are no significant environmental impacts,” said Wallace Taylor, an attorney representing the anti-nuclear groups, arguing that the environmental analysis should have come from a perspective of retooling, recalibrating and restarting a dormant facility.

The Commission issued a draft of its findings in January, where it outlined the purpose and need reviving the facility would serve, the level of environmental review needed and provided a description of the plant, any potential alternatives, and the various ways it could impact the environment. 
The environmental assessment cites Michigan’s standard for 100% clean energy by 2040, which includes provisions for nuclear energy and natural gas with 90% effective carbon capture technology in justifying the need for the project. It also argues the facility will enhance electrical reliability in the state by generating consistent, carbon-free energy and reducing the state’s reliance on imported energy sources. 
Although the commission reviewed alternatives like replacing the current reactor with a new reactor; replacing the reactor with other alternatives like natural gas, solar and wind; and using alternative system designs with the current reactor, it only provided further analysis for a no-action alternative, where it would deny the authorizations needed to bring Palisades back online. 
After reviewing a number of potential concerns, commission staff ultimately concluded the project would have no significant environmental impacts, and that choosing not to grant the authorizations Holtec needs to operate the plant would violate the purpose and need of the project: meeting clean energy demand. 
Terry Lodge, also representing the groups challenging the review, contended that the purpose of need statement was flawed, arguing it presents a restart of the plant as the only viable option without offering any justification or explanation of the demand for power. 
Lodge and Taylor also argued the limited consideration of alternatives to the plant was similarly problematic. 
“I think that it’s pretty obvious that renewable energy would have a lessened environmental impact than a nuclear plant, which would require uranium mining, which would require something to be done with the radioactive waste. There’s radioactive material, like tritium, for example, that comes from nuclear plants, and all of that would have to be considered to have a really appropriate discussion in the [environmental analysis], and that wasn’t done,” Taylor said. 
Lodge further contended that the impact of the project remains unclear, as Holtec is still working to identify whether it needs to replace key components of the reactor, like steam generators, arguing the environmental effects of the restart are not yet known and quantified.
While justifying their findings, commission staff explained that the purpose and needs statement is used to determine the range of alternatives considered within the assessment. 
Anita Naber, representing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, explained that the alternatives analysis is intended to determine whether there are other options available or environmentally preferable alternatives.
She later explained that while developing a purpose and need statement for their environmental analysis, staff members give substantial weight to the goals and needs of an applicant, in line with both the commission’s policy and case law. 
“The staff will look at the applicant’s purpose and need and the factual background and information that’s submitted by the applicant in support of that purpose and need and evaluate that. And that’s what the staff did for the Palisades restart environmental assessment,” Naber said. 
In offering their closing arguments to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, the plant’s opponents emphasized that an environmental impact should have been required for the project since the beginning, and would have required a much more in-depth analysis of alternatives.

However, members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec argued that the contentions filed by the opposing groups should be denied, as they were not responding to new information as required by the commission’s rules. Naber also noted that the commission expects petitioners to file contentions on the basis of an applicant’s environmental report rather than delaying them until after the staff issues its environmental analysis. 
“To have their contentions admitted for hearing, petitioners must demonstrate some sort of genuine factual or legal dispute with the staff draft [environmental analysis], which they have not done. They also need to provide actual fact or expert support for their assertion, but they have not done this either,” Naber said. 
On rebuttal, Lodge argued that the Commission’s rules allow petitioners to file new or amended contentions based on a draft or final environmental impact statement, environmental assessment or any supplements to those documents. 
“We timely and we believe properly under this section amended our contentions,” Lodge said, arguing their updated contentions should not be excluded as a result. 
The panel will take the matter under consideration and will determine whether to accept the opposition’s updated contentions.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Let us begin with the word “scum.”
One potential GOP candidate for the soon-to-be-vacated U.S. Senate seat of Mitch McConnell is 44-year-old Nate Morris, a technology entrepreneur from Lexington. In a recent Breitbart interview, as reported by Austin Horn of the Lexington Herald-Leader, Morris recounted an interaction he said he had with a wealthy McConnell donor during the Kentucky Derby earlier this month. “I said, ‘Let me tell you something: Mitch McConnell is scum.’”
In announcing his candidacy for McConnell’s seat, Republican Andy Barr, 51, said, “The woke left wants to neuter America, literally.” We can assume Barr meant figuratively, but this sort of talk can inspire real acts of violence by those who take it literally.
When asked during a KET panel this week about the president’s statement that he doesn’t know if he needs to obey the Constitution, Kentucky’s GOP communications director Andy Westberry pivoted to chastising Democrats for “fear-mongering” and pearl-clutching.
Kentucky communications professional Scott Jennings, age 47 and the most prominent GOP commentator on CNN, recently stood on stage at a rally with the president and said, “Michigan, we were flying in here today, and I said look at these farms. I got to get a farm in Michigan, because when you own as many libs as I do, you gotta get a place to put ’em all.” Later, Jennings posted on X that he got “caught up in the moment” with a sideways laughing emoji.
Is this how grown men, professional men, speak now in the commonwealth?
We hear much (and rightly so) about how American boys feel isolated and angry, that they are growing up in the age of outrage; of 24/7 cell phones and internet and social media; of the damage being done due to the lack of common decency and good role models. 
And yet the above are everyday examples of the kind of sneering, childish, mean-spirited, petty behavior we see regularly from grown men in power and public service.
On May 10, I talked privately with a pastor about the damage social media, the tech bros (like Elon Musk) and podcast bros (like Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro) are doing to our kids, about the ripping down of decency and civility in families and among neighbors. One reason cited for folks no longer going to church: They are so hurt and dispirited by what they see family members and neighbors post on Facebook, X and Instagram — yes, much of it about politics — that they don’t want to see them in church where they will have to shake hands and smile and pretend they haven’t seen what they’ve seen. So they just stay home.
When writer Zadie Smith reviewed the 2010 movie “The Social Network” about the founding of Facebook, she wrote, “When a human being becomes a set of data on a Web site like Facebook, he or she is reduced. Everything shrinks. Individual character. Friendships. Language. Sensibility.  … Our denuded networked selves don’t look more free, they just look more owned.” 
Just once, I would like to write about Kentucky politics without mentioning the current president at all, as I find him boringly repetitive. This is impossible. Not because I am obsessed with him but because GOP politicians and political operatives in our state are tripping over each other to win his approval and endorsement as though his gaze is all that matters. 
To quote Smith, they just look more owned.
GOP candidates do not use their TV appearances and social media to present policy ideas; they post and preen with the singular, embarrassingly desperate hope that the president will notice them frantically waving from the back of the room — Pick me! Pick me! — and make them the winner they think they can’t be without him.
In addition to calling him “scum,”’Nate Morris recently said about McConnell — a man Kentuckians have elected to the Senate for almost as long as Morris has been alive — that he  “completely pulled his pants down for President Biden” when negotiating.
When asked on KET about the president’s potential abuse of the legal system — ignoring the right of habeas corpus, for instance — Andy Westberry said flatly to former Democratic Congressman John Yarmuth, “well, you all started it.” A 9-year-old in the backseat of his parents’ car comes to mind.
And Scott Jennings — also rumored to be considering a run for McConnell’s seat — has a book coming out with a title casting the president as the savior of Western Civilization, illustrating what happens when you’re a grown man who has to not only drink all of Dear Leader’s KoolAid but stir up a new pitcher and guzzle more than the other guys.
It is 2025. 
Kids are in crisis. Adults are in crisis. We need mature leaders.
But we now live in a world where the man whose name is on the Kentucky GOP headquarters is proudly called “scum” by his own party members, and the man who started his first presidency with the arrogant pledge that he can grab any woman he wants “by the pussy” is Kentucky’s GOP kingmaker. 
I have bad news. The Republicans who want to represent you in the U.S. Senate are engaged in a sophomoric, cage-match, hazing ritual, and the one on the ballot in 2026 will be the one willing to humiliate himself the most.

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)With bipartisan agreement that Maine’s property tax burden is too high, legislators are pushing for some tweaks to tax credits this year, however they’re holding off on substantial reform until a task force can study the issue. 
Among its work on 18 bills on Thursday, the Taxation Committee removed the policy changes from a bipartisan plan from legislative leadership to provide property tax relief. Instead, the committee members unanimously agreed the bill should be exclusively focused on the creation of a task force that would report back legislative recommendations starting next year.
“The truth of the matter is with 2,000 bills that we’re working in five months,” said co-chair Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock), “I actually think taking a break and being able to focus on one thing for a period of time is the way we can get the best outcome for Maine people.” 
The Maine Legislature is approaching its expected final month of work for the first year of the two-year session and is overall considering dozens of bills that aim to reform property taxes. 
Some have received favorable votes from the Taxation Committee including on Thursday a plan to expand the Property Tax Fairness Credit. The committee also earlier advanced a proposal to increase the state’s tax exemption for homeowners and another to expand property tax relief for veterans and their survivors, with the latter passing both the Maine House of Representatives and Senate this week.  
The committee’s recommendations largely fell in line with the positions of Gov. Janet Mills’ administration, including committee members unanimously opposing on Thursday attempts to reinstate previously repealed programs related to property taxes.  
“We did take the time and really work the task force,” Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) said, referring to the several hours the committee spent Thursday morning hashing out the details of its composition and deadlines. “I think it makes sense right now to go that way rather than try to piecemeal things.”
Task force 
A bipartisan bill, LD 1770 sponsored by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) and co-sponsored by House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) and Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), among others, initially sought to both increase the property tax fairness credit and establish a Real Estate Property Tax Relief Task Force. 
The committee unanimously decided to advance an amended version of the bill that only included the latter, which now sets LD 1770 on a likely path to passage. The Mills administration had some concerns about the policy changes in LD 1770 given the tight budget year but was fully supportive of the task force component.
Stating that they’d like to wait for the recommendations from this task force for major reform, the committee unanimously rejected most of the other property tax bills it considered on Thursday. These included LDs 432, 1304, 1464, 1537, 1591, 1610, 1729 and 1798.
“We are taking all of this, all of this information, seriously,” said Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon), “and that is why we are sending it over to the task force, because they can take the appropriate amount of time to see which bills can be properly worked and implemented.” 
Other lawmakers withdrew their own bills, including Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) who withdrew LD 614, which sought to modify certain property tax assessment methods.
“I believe a long term answer to this problem requires much more than occasional increases to the Homestead exemption, tax credits, or other temporary fixes,” Foster said. “I think the task force and its work this bill would establish may provide that answer.”
Daughtry had outlined that the task force would be required to be geographically diverse and composed of legislators, economists, tax experts, real estate professionals and representatives of low-income and older residents. 
The committee added additional specifications, including that those representing low-income and older residents be people with that lived experience and that one member must represent municipalities with fewer than 10,000 residents and different forms of government — i.e. both cities and towns.
While the committee had wanted the task force to complete its work within the current 132nd Legislature, it ultimately compromised, given concerns about staff workload in light of changes on the federal level raised by Michael Allen, associate commissioner for Tax Policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.
With the Republican majority in U.S. Congress pushing for a budget plan with new tax breaks, cuts to Medicaid and other programs, Maine state government will likely have to return to readjust state spending and operations once the details are finalized, Allen said. 
“That means we’re looking at conformity sometime in the middle of the summer of a very complicated bill, which is going to probably require this committee to come in to evaluate any proposal by the governor,” Allen said. “It may take two or three weeks just to figure out what exactly Congress did and its impact on state revenue.” 
Therefore, the committee agreed to have the task force issue an interim report in January 2026, but also have the ability to continue its work until December 2026, when a final report would be due. 
Rep. Gregory Lewis Swallow (R-Houlton) was alone in offering a different take on the task force. He thinks limiting it to only studying property taxes is too narrow.
“Everything is synergistic on this issue,” Swallow said. “When you deal with one tax, you’re dealing with another tax.”
Changes to existing credits 
The state has incrementally expanded the Property Tax Fairness Credit, the latest of which occurred last year. The credit allows taxpayers to receive back a portion of their property tax or rent paid during the tax year, with the value calculated by the degree to which the “base benefit” exceeds 4% four of a person’s annual income.
In the 2023 tax year, the state essentially returned just under $80 million to taxpayers through the credit and after the latest expansion the state has returned about $115 million to taxpayers in 2024, though that number may change as returns come in.  
Allen said 33,463 taxpayers have benefitted from the expansion, with an average tax cut of $678, including 7,672 people who would have earlier been ineligible. 
Another adjustment could be coming. 
The committee unanimously voted to advance LD 715, sponsored by Rep. Nina Azella Milliken (D-Blue Hill), which would allow for people over the age of 65 with an annual income of $36,000 or less to receive a credit equal to the amount by which the “base benefit” exceeds 3% of their annual income, a decrease from the current 4%.
Former state Rep. Ron Russell introduced this plan last session, and while his bill passed both chambers, it ultimately did not get funded. 
On the other hand, the committee voted 8-3 against LD 1665, sponsored by Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland), which covered similar ground but with a wider scope. It proposed increasing the benefit base to varying levels based on age and number of children. 
The majority of the committee ultimately rejected the plan, with Grohowski and Quint agreeing that the state shouldn’t muddy the waters by adding another track for people with dependents to the property tax fairness credit when the state already has a specific child tax credit, which the committee has separately recommended be expanded.
Committee rejects efforts to bring back repealed programs 
Enacted in 2022, the Property Tax Stabilization Program allowed people 65 years old and over to freeze their property taxes at the previous year’s level regardless of income, as long as they owned a permanent residence for at least 10 years and were eligible to receive a homestead exemption. Mills allowed the law to take effect without her signature.  
However, the Legislature repealed that program after just one year in effect, following skyrocketing cost projections, concern about wealthy property owners taking advantage due to a lack of income restrictions and the administrative burden it left on municipalities.
The eligibility expansion for the Property Tax Fairness Credit and the creation of a Property Tax Deferral Program had been some of the ways lawmakers tried to soften the blow of this repeal last session. 
With unanimous votes among those present, the Taxation Committee rejected Republican proposals to reinstate the program, albeit with some changes aimed to address the program’s shortcomings.
LD 1481, sponsored by Rep. Wayne Parry (R-Arundel), would add income limits for eligibility, and LD 1541, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Martin (R-Oxford), would exempt all Mainers over 65 from property taxes. The latter bill is co-sponsored by Republican leaders, Sen. Trey Stewart of Aroostook and Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor.  
“We should have fixed it,” Parry said of the program during a Wednesday press conference, “not gotten rid of it.”
In 2024, the Legislature repealed a law that limited the total levy that could be raised by a municipality via property taxes each year. LD 542, which is sponsored by Rep. Jeffrey Sean Adams (R-Lebanon), proposed reestablishing municipal property tax levy limits.
The State and Local Government Committee was split on the proposal and not along party lines. Six legislators voted for its passage, while six voted against it. The majority of the House opposed the bill on Tuesday, with a 79-62 vote against passage, and the Senate tabled it on Wednesday. 
Regardless of how the Legislature’s final votes come down, the Mills administration is also opposed to both bills, so they would likely get vetoed.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The U. S. House of Representatives is now considering a radical budget and tax plan that would take health coverage and food assistance away from more than 100,000 Kentuckians, all to offset a fraction of the cost of cutting taxes for America’s wealthiest people and corporations. If passed, it would be the largest funding cut to both Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in history.
More than 1 in 3 Kentuckians use Medicaid to see a doctor or afford medicine, but the new House plan would make it harder to get, keep and use that health coverage. It includes:

Burdensome work reporting requirements that put 197,000 to 282,000 Kentuckians at risk of terminated health coverage for those caught up in new red tape.
Mandatory copays that would delay or prevent working class Kentuckians from getting needed care.
More frequent checks for eligibility leading to needless coverage-ending mistakes.
Cuts that make coverage options more expensive for those who purchase health insurance on kynect – adding thousands of dollars for many families.

SNAP, meanwhile, helps more than 575,000 Kentuckians afford their groceries. But this House plan would radically restructure the 50-year-old program by:

Increasing red-tape requirements that will kick older people and parents off the program, putting 135,000 Kentuckians at risk for the first time.
Shrinking SNAP by shifting up to $190 million in annual costs to the already-underfunded state budget, equal to the cost of hiring 2,354 Kentucky public school teachers.
Preventing future benefit changes to match updated nutrition standards or a rapid rise in cost of food, as we’ve all experienced recently.

As a state where so many people are able to receive medical care and put food on the table because of these federal programs, Kentucky would be left sicker, hungrier and poorer by these cruel and unnecessary changes. The cuts will pass huge new costs down to Kentucky’s budget, potentially squeezing out state investments in everything from education to infrastructure. And the cuts will weaken our economy as well, especially in rural Kentucky.
Medicaid keeps the doors open at many hospitals. Cuts that result in terminated coverage or less care threaten the jobs of nurses and providers across the state. At the same time, SNAP stimulates local economies and supports jobs at farmers’ markets and grocery stores. In 2024, more than $1.3 billion in federal SNAP benefits went to more than 4,700 retailers across the state. 
These cuts are being proposed in part because many politicians in Washington want to extend key parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. The richest 1% in Kentucky would receive over $45,000 in annual tax cuts from those extensions, while the poorest 20% would get $70. The House bill also adds even more giveaways to the wealthy by further increasing the estate tax exemption, expanding the pass-through deduction loophole for super-rich investors, and creating a new tax credit for the exact kind of private school vouchers that Kentuckians roundly rejected in the Amendment 2 vote last year.
And that’s just some of the dangerous changes in this plan. The proposal also hurts immigrants and their U. S. citizen children, makes the cost of student loans go up and denies the full child tax credit for the very poorest kids who would benefit the most from the added income. It kills energy tax breaks that have helped fuel new jobs at battery plants and power installations all across Kentucky. 
Taken as a whole, the House plan is a recipe for greater hardship and the redistribution of wealth from hard-working Kentuckians and their kids to the pockets of the richest people in our country.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/guthriepallone-2214935790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 06:01:45.425976

Fining, jailing or ticketing someone experiencing homelessness for unauthorized camping or sleeping outside will not solve the homelessness problem, said Whitehead, the event’s keynote speaker. He urged conference participants to fight against proposed legislation in North Carolina that would make unauthorized camping and sleeping illegal.

“I’m asking you today, before you leave this conference, call your representative in Washington, in the state House, make sure that North Carolina doesn’t become included in those communities that are criminalizing homelessness,” Whitehead said.
Whitehead was referring to House Bill 781, which is winding its way through the General Assembly. The bill would ban unauthorized camping and sleeping on public property and allow local governments by “majority vote” to designate local government-owned property to be used for a “continuous period of up to one year for public camping or sleeping purposes.” Local governments can renew the one-year period.
Whitehead shared that a 2014 study in Osceola, Florida found that 37 chronically homeless people were arrested approximately 1,250 times at a cost of more than $6 million to the community.
“We know, if you jail, fine or arrest somebody, it does not solve homelessness,” Whitehead said. “Criminalization is not the solution, but those are local decisions, and the only way we can have an impact on those local solutions, those local issues, is that we have to be advocates in our community beyond the service.”
Rep. Brian Biggs (R-Randolph), a cosponsor of HB 781 has pushed back against claims the bill criminalizes homelessness.
“This bill does not criminalize homelessness,” Biggs insisted. “It addresses unauthorized public property camping and sleeping without prohibiting homelessness itself.”
Biggs has said HB 781 grew out of conversations with municipal leaders who asked for guidance around handling the state’s growing homeless crisis. He said the state can no longer wait to address the problem.

Speaking just ahead of Whitehead on Thursday, Gov. Josh Stein also took aim at HB 781, contrasting it with bills introduced this session that are designed to increase affordable housing stock. Stein said lawmakers have put forward “many creative solutions” to address the state’s housing shortage, such as a proposal to allow developers to build new housing in any area zoned for commercial, retail or office use without having to rezone the property.
“They’re [lawmakers] thinking boldly about how we can increase housing supply, and this is certainly an issue where there is a possibility for bipartisan solutions,” Stein said. “On the other hand, we are seeing efforts at the General Assembly to make sleeping in a park a crime. No one should have to sleep outside. It’s a real problem, but we need to find real solutions by connecting people with supportive services and putting more roofs over more heads.”
Bans on authorized camping and sleeping are coming as the rate of homelessness is rising, Whitehead said.
“Last year, we had the highest number of people experiencing homelessness in the history of our country, at least since it’s been measured by Congress, which goes back to the early 2000s, over 770,000 people (an 18% increase over the previous year),” Whitehead said.
HUD’s 2024 Annual Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) found that the number of people experiencing homelessness increased in every category — except for veterans — measured during the department’s annual Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. The count is a snapshot of the number of individuals in shelters, temporary housing and unsheltered on a single night.
The Founding Fathers in the Preamble to the Constitution promised U.S. citizens life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, Whitehead said.
“You can’t pursue happiness sleeping under a bridge,” Whitehead said. “There is no liberty when you are fined, jailed or ticketed because you can’t afford a place to live. You cannot pursue happiness if you lay your head in the back of an automobile.”
State advocates for people experiencing homelessness contend HB 781 will diminishes local autonomy while making cities and counties both fiscally responsible and legally liable for the implementing state-sanctioned encampment policies. The NC Coalition to End Homelessness (NCCEH) has also expressed concern that the proposal is being pushed by the Cicero Institute, a conservative think tank, that has led efforts to pass similar legislation in Arizona, Missouri, Tennessee, Iowa, Georgia, Florida, Wisconsin and Kentucky.

The institute was founded by tech-industry capitalist Joe Lonsdale, who is critical of the “housing first” approach to ending homelessness. That model prioritizes providing individuals and families with permanent, affordable housing as the first step in ending their plight.
“While Cicero describes itself as a think tank, its policies promote industries that potentially profit from criminalizing poverty,” said Dr. Latonya Agard, executive director of NCCEH. Agard said Cicero’s policies promote industries that will potentially profit from criminalizing poverty. “States that adopted Cicero laws find they are funneling more public money into incarceration, so while these bills could lead to the financial enrichment of out-of-state investors of privatized jails and prisons and monitoring technologies, they will worsen conditions for North Carolinians without housing,” Agard said.
Both Stein and Whitehead expressed concerns about proposed federal budget cuts to eliminate Section 8 housing.
“More than 25,000 people in North Carolina depend on Section 8 to have a home they can’t afford to have that support taken away from them, and we cannot afford it either,” Stein said. “Let’s work to expand access to housing, not take it away.”
Stein said he’s also concerned about proposed cuts to Medicaid and the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.) The SNAP program, once referred to as Food Stamps, provides low-income families with food for an adequate diet.
“These cuts pose a serious threat to the wallets and wellbeing of so many hard-working families here in North Carolina,” Stein said. “Cuts to essential needs like health care and food make it that much harder for people to afford housing, and they’ll make it even harder for our state to afford to support our people.”
Whitehead said the proposed cuts to the nation’s social safety net programs would push more people into homelessness and cause harm to those who are already unsheltered.
“If that budget goes through, it would be a devastating impact on people experiencing homelessness,” he said. “I don’t know who you voted for, but I don’t think you voted for an 80% reduction in HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] staff or $1 trillion worth of cuts between Medicaid and the SNAP program — I don’t think that’s what you voted for — and all of that in order to be able to enact a $45 trillion tax cut, which benefits people at the top of the economic ladder.”

Devdutta Sangvai, the N.C. Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that in the coming days the proposed Medicaid and SNAP cuts will be widely discussed. Sangvai reminded conferences attendees that both are connected to housing.
“Behavioral Health is connected to housing. Housing is connected to child care. Child Care is connected to the economy,” Sangvai said. “We do not have to artificially connect the dots to make a point. It is proven. There are data out there to support that. And so we really need to understand that if we don’t address the homelessness issue in the housing crisis, it poses a direct threat to the stability and economic well being of North Carolina.”

(NPS staff/Peterson/Public domain)Forests are extremely valuable for watersheds, wildlife, carbon storage, recreation and so much more. The deceptively named Fix Our Forests Act, or FOFA, does nothing to conserve forests to retain these values. Instead, it would emphasize logging and otherwise manipulating forests at a scale we haven’t seen on public lands for many decades, if ever.
The misguided bill has already passed the House, and its Senate version was recently introduced by Colorado’s own U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper and other Western senators. FOFA encourages the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, which manage most of the federal lands in the Western U.S., to avoid a careful examination of impacts from logging and ways to reduce harms under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Under FOFA, projects up to 10,000 acres — over 15 square miles — would be excluded from consideration of possible impacts. The effects to watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation and scenery would be massive. What’s more, the public would have only one chance to provide input for logging projects and could only object in court.

If Fix Our Forests passes, agencies would no longer need to consult about their management plans with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if new threatened or endangered species were listed or critical habitat was designated for them, or even if new information surfaced concerning what action was needed for their recovery to secure populations. This provision could lead to further harm to species already on the edge of continued existence.
The use of livestock grazing to reduce the risk of fire would be also encouraged. Grazing can be extremely harmful to fragile ecosystems, especially near streams and lakes. Stock can denude vegetation, leading to invasion by non-native species, such as cheatgrass, which burns easily and readily reestablishes itself after fires. Yet under FOFA, grazing could be used for “post-fire restoration and recovery,” in spite of adverse impacts.
Under recent direction from its Washington office, the U.S. Forest Service would be encouraged to use two methods of approving logging projects that would basically allow loggers to select which trees they want to cut and sell to mills. The largest trees, the ones most valuable for wildlife and storing carbon, would likely be taken. FOFA would even allow logging for the purpose of “retaining and expanding forest products infrastructure,” i.e., with no other goal than to benefit the logging industry by giving them logs off public lands at taxpayer expense.
In the bill, “high priority hazard trees” would be defined as those likely to fall, which could of course mean almost all trees in the forest. Areas up to 6,000 acres containing such trees within 300 feet of Forest Service roads could be cut with no consideration of impacts. Similarly, trees that could fall within 150 feet of a powerline could be cut with no assessment of possible impacts.
Science, much of it researched by the Forest Service, clearly shows the best way to protect houses and other infrastructure is by removing flammable material from the structures and an area no more than 100 feet surrounding them. Cutting our public forests will not protect our communities.
We don’t need to degrade and destroy forests to save our homes and infrastructure from fire. Our forests need more protection from harmful activities, not less, in order to retain the great benefits they provide for us and other species as well.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said she had been awake over 36 hours by the time she joined a call with members of the media on Thursday to discuss GOP lawmakers’ plan to slash $625 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.
The lack of sleep didn’t disturb her, she said, but her Republican colleagues’ advancement of Medicaid overhaul proposals that could leave over 630,000 Virginians  and millions of Americans without health insurance, however, did. 
McClellan serves in the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which wrapped up a 25-hour session Wednesday by voting to pass Republican-led legislation to cut Medicaid funding by tens of billions and impose “work requirements nationwide for able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 65, with several exceptions, including for pregnant people, enrollees with certain disabilities or serious medical conditions, and parents of dependent children,” States Newsroom reported. 
“That is what happened while you were sleeping,” McClellan said Thursday. 
The Medicaid cuts are part of what President Donald Trump has dubbed a “big, beautiful bill,” and it’s likely the Republican-controlled Congress could approve the huge package of measures and send Trump the legislation to sign through their budget reconciliation process. 
States’ allocation of federal funding for Medicaid is determined by a formula called Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which remains untouched for now. But some low-income Virginians could contend with the work requirements if the overall package fully passes. 
Virginia resident Aida Pacheco called the proposed work requirements “insulting” earlier this year when describing how her adult daughter had to stop work during aggressive breast cancer treatment, which Medicaid now helps her cover.

She expressed frustration that some opponents of Medicaid have accused beneficiaries of “abusing the system” or being people who “don’t want to work.” 
And while people who utilize Medicaid do work — and often tap into the program should their employer not provide health insurance — Pacheco said people like her daughter would be in health care limbo if Trump’s planned overhaul succeeds.
Henrico County resident Andrew Daughtry, who joined McClellan’s press call Thursday, said he left his job at Dollar General to pursue his dream of working in construction several years ago. Though he was able to earn more money in that field, he no longer had health insurance, so Medicaid allowed him to stay on top of his physical and mental health care in recent years. 
Now temporarily out of work because of an injury on the job, he said he’s sorting through worker’s compensation while he prepares for forthcoming surgeries. Medicaid has helped him manage his appointments.

“I want to tell Congress, ‘please don’t question our work ethic because that is insulting,’” Daughtry said. “I couldn’t get health care through my job but I need Medicaid to pay the thousands of dollars of injuries that have happened on the job.”
 McClellan noted how uninsured people are more likely to avoid regular checkups or treatments for chronic disorders — resulting in emergency room visits when dire situations arise. As emergency rooms are federally-required to treat all patients, this means care for uninsured patients who cannot pay can become a shared financial burden on taxpayers. 
“When you kick people off of their health insurance, that raises the cost for everybody else,” McClellan said. 
While the FMAP hasn’t yet changed, McClellan remains concerned it could. If that happens, state lawmakers will have to determine how to keep the roughly 630,000 Virginians that are eligible under the state’s 2018 expansion covered. 
Trigger language in that law could end the expansion if federal funding is adjusted. Currently, Virginia’s private acute-care hospitals are footing the 10% not covered by federal funding. Some state lawmakers suggested earlier this year that a special session could become possible to sort out if and how the state could take up the rest of the funding mantle. 
Meanwhile, Gov. Glenn Youngkin reserved $900 million of the state’s budget surplus as “cushion” for “short-term disruptions” from steep federal cuts and job layoffs. 
Some Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation expressed satisfaction Thursday about being able to advance Trump’s agenda without altering the funding formula for Virginia’s federal Medicaid allocation 
U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland said that he’s “pleased to see Virginia’s vulnerable populations protected in the Medicaid portion of the reconciliation bill and no change to the federal match rate.”

However, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shared with States Newsroom shows that the Medicaid changes would cut $625 billion in federal spending over the next decade. About 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during that 10-year budget window.
After fielding constituents’ concerns about the federal cuts for months, Wittman publicly cautioned his colleagues in April, co-signing a letter to Congressional leadership emphasizing protection of “children, seniors, individuals with disabilities, and pregnant women who rely on Medicaid for their health and economic security.”
He added Thursday that trimming or eliminating other aspects of the program will ensure that it is “a sustainable program for years to come.”
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, however, had sharper words for his Democratic colleagues. 
“Congressional Democrats and progressive prognosticators shouted day and night that the Energy and Commerce Committee couldn’t make budget recommendations without massive, significant cuts to Medicaid,” he said in a statement, in an apparent reference to FMAP’s preservation in the proposed measure “And yet, House Republicans proved them all wrong.” 
No other Republican members of Virginia’s congressional delegation responded to requests for comment by the time of this publication.
Now that the Energy and Commerce committee’s recommendations have advanced, they will be considered next by the Budget Committee. Changes to the reconciliation bill — how Congress is working through the budget right now — will still be possible. Then they will have to be voted on by both the full House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.

Glenn Youngkin signs legislation reforming child welfare laws in Richmond on Thursday as Katie Jones (right), who spent much of her childhood in the foster system, looks on. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Katie Jones was 11 the last time she saw her childhood home, where her father, an alcoholic, stayed between jail stints and her mother struggled with heroin addiction. One day after school, just moments after she had settled in with a bag of chips and her homework, police and social services workers pulled up outside. 
Within minutes, Jones and her five siblings were loaded into vehicles, separated from each other, and plunged into the foster care system — an experience that would shuffle her through five homes, three schools, and years of uncertainty before she aged out at 18, never adopted.
Now 25, Jones stood beside Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday as he signed a slate of new child welfare reforms into law and launched “Safe Kids, Strong Families,” a sweeping initiative to strengthen Virginia’s support for foster youth and help families in crisis stay together.
“The system is broken and it needs to be changed,” Jones told the crowd gathered at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond’s Capitol Square. “I hope sharing my story today makes a difference.”
As of April 1 2024, there are 5,156 children in foster care in Virginia, with 2,638 (51.16%) children in non-relative foster homes, according to data from the Virginia Department of Social Services. The children range in age from birth to 17 years.
Thursday’s event brought together lawmakers, advocates, caseworkers, and foster families to celebrate progress in Virginia’s child welfare system — and to acknowledge how far it still has to go.
Among the bills Youngkin signed were House Bill 1777 and Senate Bill 1406, bipartisan proposals that guarantee foster youth age 12 and older direct access to the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman. 
The legislation ensures children can file complaints and communicate with the ombudsman without requiring permission from social workers, foster parents, or custodians. It also requires agencies to provide contact information to foster youth, their families and caregivers.
Supporters say the measure will help increase transparency and empower youth to advocate for themselves — something Jones didn’t always feel she could do.
“Children need families. Children need support, and they need love,” Youngkin said. “When we work together in order to address this basic need … then we are all marching together toward a destination that will truly guarantee a great future for the commonwealth of Virginia.”
The governor said his focus on child welfare reform began at the onset of his term with one startling fact: over 100 children in foster care were sleeping in social services offices because there was nowhere else to send them.
“I asked Janet Kelly to take on this most important task of finding a place for these children to call home,” Youngkin said. Kelly, now Virginia’s Secretary of Health and Human Resources, had been serving as a senior advisor at the time. She launched the Safe and Sound Task Force, and within months, the number of children sleeping in government offices dropped dramatically.
“I remember the first time she came into my office and said, ‘Governor, tonight, there are no children sleeping in offices.’ That was a moment,” Youngkin said. “Today, we still have a few. But that is the absolute exception now — not the rule.”
Kelly, speaking from personal experience, called the work “deeply personal.”

“By investing in them, coaching them, believing in them, trusting them, teaching them, loving them, and listening to them, all kids — even and especially kids in foster care — can have the opportunity to turn heartbreak into hope,” she said.
Thirteen years ago, Kelly and her husband took custody of an 18-month-old boy through a kinship placement. “It worked pretty well,” she said, “but we know all too well that the balance of hope and heartbreak never ends when it comes to foster care.”
Another reform that Youngkin signed Thursday, Senate Bill 801, modernizes the Children’s Services Act (CSA), expanding eligibility to children identified as “in need of services.” It also mandates state approval for the tool used to determine eligibility and eliminates outdated references to long-defunct programs and structures.
Youngkin called the bill a turning point. “Kinship care is at the heart of providing a safe place for kids and strong families,” he said. “And the work that was done on a bipartisan basis … changes everything.”
He pointed to recent progress in Virginia’s kinship placement rankings. “We’re watching the numbers move,” he said. “Virginia went from last, and we’re climbing.”
But the governor also issued a challenge.
“Notwithstanding the tremendous progress that we have made, we have huge mountains yet to climb,” Youngkin said. Abuse hotline calls are up 25% since 2020, he noted, and more than 70% of child fatalities tied to abuse or neglect had prior contact with child protective services.
“Forty percent of frontline workers leave their jobs after one year due to trauma and burnout,” he added. “We need to continue to strive to be the very best — not because we want to be ranked, but because we are serving children.”
“Safe Kids, Strong Families” aims to take a system-wide approach to reform, aligning policy, funding, and community efforts around a shared goal — stability, safety, and long-term success for every Virginia child. 
First lady Suzanne Youngkin reminded the audience of the moral and spiritual weight behind the work.
“Every single person in this room — and everyone in the commonwealth of Virginia, in our country, in our world — has an obligation to defend the weak, rescue the poor, keep them from the wicked, and focus on the fatherless and motherless,” she said. “It’s a very intricate web of services, of laws, of God stepping into the gap.”
For Katie Jones, those gaps were often wide and painful.
“The sad truth is most foster kids don’t graduate high school, less than 10% go to college, and even fewer get a degree or certification,” she said. “I was the exception, I got lucky. But to this day, I never got adopted.”

We have the power to make it cheaper and quicker for families to install rooftop solar and home batteries by streamlining local permitting processes.
Unfortunately, permitting wait times and delays for rooftop solar in Colorado are some of the worst in the western United States.
In Arapahoe County, for example, the majority of permits take more than 10 weeks to process. These delays impose significant costs. According to a recent analysis by Brown University, local red tape increases the price of installing a residential solar system by more than $3,200. This price hike puts solar out reach of thousands of Coloradans, particularly low- and middle-income families. As solar professionals in Colorado, we can attest to the detrimental impact of these unnecessary bureaucratic barriers: fewer jobs installing solar and more greenhouse gas emissions.

Wisely, our General Assembly offered legislation this year to tackle this problem. House Bill 25-1096, sponsored by Reps. Lesley Smith and Kyle Brown and Sen. Matt Ball, and championed by Gov. Jared Polis, would have required our cities and counties to implement one of several software platforms that automatically approve most residential solar and home battery permits. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden developed one of these software platforms, SolarAPP+, which is now used in Denver — and in hundreds of other localities around the country. Using a platform such as SolarAPP+ also makes for faster inspections. Automating solar permitting is one of those rare win-wins — saving families and solar installers money and headaches, and saving cities and counties resources and time.
But climate-forward cities and counties, including Boulder and Fort Collins, lined up this legislative session to oppose the legislation and were ultimately responsible for its demise. They argued that automated permitting would prevent them from assessing the historical significance of every home built before 1975 before allowing solar panels on its roof, that certain homes in flood plains should be raised on stilts before they were allowed to install rooftop solar, and that their government IT departments would struggle to implement widely-used free software.
Their opposition is disappointing. Boulder and Fort Collins have set goals to get to 100% renewable energy by 2030 — a stronger target than even the state of Colorado. And yet city officials and local electeds in Boulder and Fort Collins spent valuable time and resources lobbying against a common-sense solution that would make rooftop solar cheaper for Coloradans statewide.
Our local governments should keep two important considerations in mind. First, decarbonization is on the chopping block in Washington, including critical funding for renewable energy projects and facilities in Colorado. Our cities and counties — especially those that claim to be environmental leaders — should do everything in their power to ensure that as subsidies go away we make renewable energy as cheap to buy and as fast to deploy as possible.
Second, we are seeing just how many Americans have lost faith in the simple idea that the government prioritizes our needs over its processes. Across the ideological spectrum, more and more believe that government is standing in the way of building what we need, from critical national infrastructure to a simple home renovation. Cities and counties in Colorado like Boulder and Fort Collins should be at the forefront of creating an efficient government that prioritizes people, rather than hiding behind local exceptionalism to justify burdensome red tape and costly inefficiency.
Colorado is blessed with abundant sunshine, and a commitment to good government. We urge our cities, counties and the legislature to step up and make it easier for Coloradans to install rooftop solar, reduce their utility bills and fight the climate crisis.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, you wrote an op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch this week pushing back against the madness emanating from Washington regarding budget cuts and federal job layoffs. It was welcome, given the chaos in D.C., but what took you so long?
Are you, a Republican representing Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, really bucking a president from your own party – or is this just PR?
Among your column’s salient points: Washington should spend taxpayer dollars wisely; even then-President Barack Obama said as much in 2010. The national debt has passed $36 trillion. The massive red ink “jeopardizes economic opportunity for future generations.”
Then the key takeaway: “We need to pursue targeted savings – not reckless cuts,” you wrote. “That means using a scalpel, not a sledgehammer, when it comes to rightsizing the federal workforce or realigning federal spending.”
Your overall tack surprised me, since many Republicans in Congress – especially the House – have been scared to confront President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, he of the reckless chainsaw and chief of the dubiously named Department of Government Efficiency. Your colleagues have been much too obsequious, placing their jobs over the welfare of the country. 
What spurred you to speak up now?
“I’ve spoken up from the beginning,” you said Wednesday in emailed responses to that question and others I asked. You provided links to recent news articles, too. Maybe I missed them, but the op-ed was more prominent.
“I called for a compassionate approach to federal workforce reforms, raised concerns after mass layoffs at the Department of Education, and advocated for Virginia’s research institutions to continue receiving federal funding,” you noted.
“I’ve shared personal stories from Virginia’s First District directly with cabinet secretaries and White House officials to ensure the human impact of these policies is fully understood.”
We’ll see whether those discussions have an impact, but it’s good you’re making the arguments.
Virginians are certainly incensed by the upheaval that the White House, the DOGE service (it’s not a real “department”), and feckless Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate majority have caused. They’re all a sop to large corporations and the nation’s wealthiest people. Under the ruse of slashing the debt, administration hacks and lawmakers are endangering the poor, disabled, immigrants and many more Americans.
More than 341,000 federal employees lived in the commonwealth in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and many could lose their jobs – even when there’s been no announced criteria for who stays and who goes, or an objective assessment of how essential their duties are.
I’m glad you’re publicly questioning the wisdom of what’s happening in D.C., Rep. Wittman. You’ve been in office since 2007, and won many of your electoral contests comfortably, so you can afford to do so. You could, however, do more.
You voted a few months ago for a budget blueprint in fiscal 2026 that targeted Medicaid, food stamps and other parts of the social safety net. The bill narrowly passed the House, 217-215, on a mainly party-line vote. Part of the goal is to extend the tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trump’s first term that are set to expire this year.
Those cuts worsened the situation. Trump’s first term saw the national debt rise by $7.8 trillion – a staggering amount.  
You said your vote this year was procedural and didn’t enact any cuts: “It simply opened the door for future debate on a broader package …”
A “no” vote, however, would’ve broken with your party, sent a warning shot about the radical nature of this agenda, and forced the Trump-Musk partnership to reassess.
Nearly 2 million Virginians receive Medicaid or FAMIS, the state’s health insurance for children. Efforts to add work requirements for Medicaid, being debated in the U.S. House, would impact whether low-income Virginians still get health care.
When I asked about Medicaid, you replied that after meetings and talks with House leadership, “I am pleased to see Virginia’s vulnerable populations protected in the Medicaid portion of the reconciliation bill. There will be no change to the federal match rate.” You said illegal beneficiaries would be removed from the rolls.
We’ll see if all that happens.
You also skirted a chance to meet with your own constituents in April during a congressional recess, after the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee advised GOP members not to hold in-person town halls. Many Republican lawmakers followed that gutless advice.
Politicians don’t meet voters when they know their initiatives have incensed the hoi polloi – especially when constituents have no idea why certain jobs and programs are suddenly deemed “extraneous.”
Wittman constituents host town hall in his absence to address immigration, federal funding concerns

The Virginia Mercury reported that 150 people showed up to a town hall in Henrico County last month held in your absence. They criticized overbearing immigration crackdowns and spending cuts. The event was mockingly dubbed “Where’s Wittman?”
Incidentally, your website earlier this week showed you held three town halls last year. You also held a telephone town hall via Facebook in late March, the Mercury reported. One recent town hall, you said, reached over 9,000 constituents – though that’s not the same as facing people in person.
Maybe it’s easier to meet constituents face-to-face when indefensible policies aren’t on the agenda. As I wrote in late March, lawsuits and recalls to work of thousands of employees occurred after some of the initial, poorly planned federal layoffs.
I asked Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, what might explain your willingness to speak out so forcefully now.
As continued cutbacks are materializing, Farnsworth said, “People are getting really worried about how that affects them.” Your op-ed, he added, “speaks to the effectiveness of public opinion in shaping” the policies of lawmakers.
“The reign of Elon Musk has been very bad for the standings of Republicans in public opinion,” the professor said.
 Rep. Wittman, I’m glad you’ve spoken out. Your words seem to confirm your commitment to improving the quality of life of the Virginians you represent.
The proof, though, will be how everyday Americans are affected following these budget negotiations. Many folks not in the top 1% are frightened by the possible outcome.

Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, speaks during a Senate session, Thursday, May 15, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate advanced two anti-sanctuary city bills to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk Thursday, bringing key Republican efforts closer to completion. 
But in other areas — including other immigration bills — the Republican-led Senate put the brakes on some conservative proposals advanced by the House. 
The chamber killed a bill that would have required all training and testing materials to be produced in English. It held back a bill that would require applicants for driver’s licenses who do not have U.S. citizenship to prove they were certified to drive in their home country.  
And it blocked a number of House bills designed to increase verification measures to vote. 
Here’s a look at where Senate Republicans broke from their House counterparts this week — and where they found agreement.
Anti-sanctuary bills
The House and Senate are aligned on a pair of anti-sanctuary bills. On Thursday, the Senate passed House Bill 511, which would require all municipalities to comply with immigration detainers by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “if safe to do so.” 
The bill, known as an anti-sanctuary city bill, would also prohibit municipalities from adopting policies to ignore federal directives or not cooperate with federal authorities. 
But it also includes a few exceptions. It does not require local law enforcement to pass along an undocumented person’s information when they have been a “necessary witness or victim” of a serious crime, which would include murder, rape, domestic violence, assault, kidnapping, blackmail, and other offenses.
And it prohibits local law enforcement from investigating the citizenship status of someone in their custody, unless they are investigating whether that person broke New Hampshire law. 
Sen. Regina Birdsell said the bill is about forcing communities to follow federal law. 
“When federal authorities present an immigration detainer, New Hampshire police departments should honor that and not help illegal immigrants evade the law,” she said. “I never thought this would be controversial.” 
But Sen. Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, countered that communities might not support ICE detainers and shouldn’t be forced by the Legislature to comply with them. 
“As a state, we should not be asked to take the responsibilities or bear the costs that … lead to such outcomes,” said Reardon. “Communities like ours should not be put in the position of enabling mass deportations or detentions that go against our values and ignore our legal and social systems.” 
HB 511 will go directly to the governor’s desk in the coming weeks. Ayotte has supported it.
On Thursday, the Senate approved House changes to a second anti-sanctuary city bill, Senate Bill 62, which would block state or local governments from prohibiting law enforcement entities from entering into voluntary agreements with ICE. That bill will also head directly to Ayotte’s desk.
Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican, noted that he has been pushing for legislation to end sanctuary cities for years, and said with the passage of SB 62, “we’ll finally complete this journey.”
Immigration bills
Yet in some areas of immigration policy, the Senate has pulled back from what the House had pushed for.
House Bill 452 created a number of new hurdles for undocumented people and those without U.S. citizenship to obtain driver’s licenses.
The bill would stop the Division of Motor Vehicles from renewing a driver’s license for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen and “cannot prove that they are a lawful permanent resident of the United States.” Currently, there is no such prohibition.
State statute says the DMV “may” require nonresidents who are living in the state on a temporary basis to provide a certification from the government of their country of origin that indicates they are licensed to drive. HB 452 would change “may” to “shall,” making it a requirement, and would allow the DMV to also accept proof of previous vehicle operation in the person’s foreign country.
But without debate, the Senate re-referred the bill to the Transportation Committee, which means there will be no vote by the full Senate until early 2026.
The Senate also killed House Bill 461, which would require that all driver’s license examinations and related materials be “distributed in the English language only,” with an exception for American Sign Language.
But it passed House Bill 71, which would prohibit public schools from offering their facilities as emergency shelter or housing exclusively to undocumented people, even if ordered to do so by the federal government or the state. The bill would allow schools to be used as shelters in other emergencies for specified disasters — including fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, high water events, tidal waves, earthquakes, or snowstorms — as long as those emergencies do not exceed 72 hours.
Voting bills
The Senate has not given House Republicans everything they have asked with voting legislation, either.
The two chambers are aligned on one particular issue. In March, the Senate passed Senate Bill 213, requiring people seeking to obtain absentee ballots to produce documentary proof of U.S. citizenship through a birth certificate, passport, or other document. The bill would bring the absentee ballot process under the same requirements as the in-person voting requirements. Last year, then-Gov. Chris Sununu signed a law imposing a hard documentary proof of citizenship requirement for new voter registrations in the state. That bill — the furthest-reaching in the country — is currently facing two lawsuits in federal court.
The Senate’s bill mirrors House Bill 217, which passed the House in March, indicating support in both chambers. On Thursday, the Senate killed that bill, arguing it was duplicative.
But the Senate rejected a different bill, House Bill 274. That bill would have required supervisors of the checklists to comb through their municipality’s voter rolls once a year and purge any voter who has not voted within the previous five years. Currently, those reviews are done once every 10 years. 
“The committee believes that requiring a yearly check, when there are already periodic checks in statute, would increase administrative costs and unduly overburden local election officials,” wrote Sen. James Gray in an explanation in the Senate calendar. 
The Senate killed the bill unanimously.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5153622-Reardon-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-16 06:01:45.425976

SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, help 1.4 million North Carolinians put food on the table, Stein said.
“If Congress goes forward with these plans, our state will be forced into perilous budget decisions – should North Carolinians lose access to food, or should we get rid of other essential services?,” Stein asked. “I urge our members of Congress to reject this budget proposal so that North Carolina families don’t go hungry.”
Currently, the federal government covers 100% of food benefits for SNAP participants. North Carolina footing $700 million in SNAP benefits for the first time would be the equivalent of 8,900 K-12 public school teacher positions, Stein said in the statement.
Stein has sent a letter to Congress laying out the implications for North Carolina if SNAP cuts move forward. Click here to read his letter.
Here’s how Stein said the loss of federal SNAP dollars would impact the state:

Four in five families participating in SNAP in North Carolina have either a child, a senior, or an adult with a disability in the household.
Each dollar used to pay for groceries through SNAP frees up household resources for other essential needs like rent, utilities or child care.
SNAP contributes nearly $2.8 billion to North Carolina’s economy, and has a multiplier effect, with every $1 invested in SNAP benefits generating between $1.50 and $1.80 for local economies.
SNAP cuts would mean people have less to spend at North Carolina’s more than 9,200 SNAP retailers, which would hurt farmers, the larger food distribution pipeline and local economies overall, especially in rural areas and small towns.

Stein said SNAP is playing a vital role in supporting western North Carolinians impacted by Hurricane Helene. He said the state’s 25 western counties most impacted by Helene still have higher enrollment in SNAP in April 2025 than they did in September 2024 before the storm hit.
Immediately after the storm, SNAP received 169,000 applications – the highest number of applications since Hurricane Florence in 2018, he said.
The U.S. House is proposing $300 billion in cuts to SNAP over the next 10 years. The program is one of the nation’s long-standing anti-poverty initiatives,. It helps more than 41 million of the nation’s most vulnerable citizens afford food.
In a message to supporters, the N.C. Budget and Tax Center said the GOP-proposed cuts to SNAP and Medicaid threaten the well-being of thousands of North Carolinians.
“As we consider what this proposal means to our communities and families here in North Carolina, we must be clear with our federal delegation — and particularly [North Carolina] Senators [Thom] Tillis and [Ted] Budd — that the House’s proposed plan to take away health care and food assistance from North Carolinians to fund tax cuts for the richest 1 percent is unacceptable.” the Budget and Tax Center said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Canned-food-provided-at-the-rescue-mission.jpg,,,2025-05-16 05:02:54.695995

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.











States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

This week, current and past staff of libraries across the state laid out for lawmakers the different ways in which the libraries have played a role in their lives and the lives of their community.
Constance Evans taught high school for 25 years, using libraries in the several counties in which she taught to supplement her English lessons and other topics.
After more than two decades, she went back to school to get a degree in Library Science.
“More than anything, that year taught me how libraries had morphed into an eclectic mix of technology, print, and online materials, and valuable partnerships connected to every facet of our Ohio communities,” Evans told the Ohio Senate Education Committee.
One thing most library representatives who spoke brought up as an important – and popular – part of their role in the community was the age-old early literacy program called storytime.
“Our storytimes are so popular that it’s not uncommon that our parking lot is full and people have to park elsewhere in the city to get to our library,” said Chauncey Montgomery, director of the Community Library in Sunbury.
For the Columbus Metropolitan Library, storytime is a stealthy way to slide learning in alongside entertainment and engagement.
“What seems like a fun-filled 30-minute reading, singing and dancing session to the untrained eye is a well-planned kindergarten readiness program designed around the four cornerstones of reading — letter recognition, beginning letter sounds, rhymes and vocabulary,” said Lauren Hagan, CEO of the Columbus library system.
Storytimes are fairly universal among libraries in the state, but there are other programs that are more tailored to the particular area of the state the library calls home.
New Carlisle is an area with a poverty rate of 20.5%, compared to the 13.3% that stands as the state average. Food insecurity is a significant issue for families who come to the New Carlisle Public Library, according to director Beth Freeman.
“We have begun offering a dinner storytime, where all family members are able to have a good meal provided by a local restaurant and hear an entertaining story one evening a month,” Freeman told the committee.
Programs of all kinds could be on the chopping block if funding changes are implemented, in a day and age when libraries have already had to be creative with existing funds as library demand and demand for more modern resources goes up. The Public Library Fund, which is currently a percentage of the state’s General Revenue Fund, saw a $27 million loss last year.
“Public funds have given our library the ability to be innovative, creative and enduring,” said Aimee Fifarek, director and CEO of the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County. “All these services and programs were all made possible because our elected leaders invested in our community.”

The House’s version of the budget would eliminate the 1.7% the Public Library Fund gets from the General Revenue Fund, and create a line-item appropriation. Legislators argued that would be a better deal for libraries, because they would avoid the fluctuations of state tax revenue from year to year.
“I’m not wanting to cut funding for libraries,” said state Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, a member of the Senate Education Committee. “But we have a hard time understanding how a percentage of a fluctuating GRF somehow makes it easier for you.”
Advocates fear going to a line-item appropriation rather than a percentage of state tax revenue could put them at risk for “across the board cuts” if the state needed to tighten its belt, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Michelle Francis, head of the Ohio Library Council.
“We’ve seen lots of programs that are line-items get eliminated, and so I will tell you that that is a strong concern going forward,” Francis said.
The budget approved by the House also rejected a proposal from the governor’s executive budget that would have raised the PLF distribution to 1.75%. An increase of that size would amount to another $15 million each year for public library coffers, according to Jay Smith, director of government and legal services for the Ohio Library Council.
With the rise in visits to libraries, up 3.4 million to 48 million visits statewide in 2024, according to the council, advocates have taken to comparing the crowds who visit their facilities to audiences at football games. Francis has frequently used Ohio Stadium as a model, saying the statewide number of visits to libraries could fill the Shoe more than 400 times.
“I haven’t compared that (2024 increase) to the Browns stadium, but that’s our next goal,” she told the committee.
Fifarek said 2024 numbers for Youngstown/Mahoning County libraries showed a population that would fill Youngstown State University’s Stambaugh Stadium more than 30 times.
Despite the consistent crowds, libraries only see funding through the Public Library Fund and local levies, with the exception of 48 library systems who don’t have levies on the books.
“We are responsible for our own buildings, but yet we do not receive money in the capital bill,” Francis said, referring to the state’s separate spending bill for infrastructure and other projects. “We also don’t get county sales tax, city income tax, no casino revenue, we didn’t get any direct (American Rescue Plan Act) funds, and we don’t have inside millage. So, that state funding is incredibly critical, and we rely on it more and even greater than our partners do the (local government fund).”
The Senate is currently working on its draft of the budget, which could contain changes to the House’s version. The two chambers will come together after the Senate approves a draft to bring forth a final draft for the governor’s signature before July 1.

Chris Stewart, R-Putnam, hasn't voted in the House since April 9. A staffing shortage at his job is the cause, a party leader said.","On April 9 at 3:59 p.m., Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Putnam, cast the last of the day’s four floor votes and left his desk in the second row of the House of Representatives for the hour-long trip home to Connecticut’s Quiet Corner.
It appears he never came back. There is no record of Stewart casting another House vote.
“Unforeseen professional obligations have temporarily limited my ability to fully engage in legislative duties and have also impacted time with my family,” Stewart said in a statement responding to an inquiry from The Connecticut Mirror.
He did not respond to texts or phone calls seeking more information about his job, its conflict with House sessions, and his expectations when he ran in November to succeed his father-in-law, Ricky Hayes, representing the 51st House District.
The General Assembly is a part-time institution, and the majority of lawmakers have outside jobs. Balancing the roles is often challenging, especially in the final weeks of every annual session.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, had few additional details behind Stewart’s long string of missed votes, other than saying the cause was a staffing shortage at his job and not illness.
“Chris has been met with a sudden crisis at work where he has to fill in,” Candelora said. “His employer knew about the commitment he had up here. Everybody was on board. And then they had a personnel situation that he is trying to fix so that he could return up here to vote.”
Stewart did not disclose the nature of his job. His statement of financial interest, a disclosure of outside income lawmakers file every April, listed his employer as Eliot Community Health Services Inc. of Massachusetts.
It was unclear when Stewart’s job situation changed. A spot check of meetings of the Education Committee, one of his legislative assignments, found uneven attendance throughout March. He didn’t vote on 26 of the 45 bills reported out of committee.

The legislature meets for three months in even-numbered years and five months in odd ones. This year, the session opened on Jan. 8 and will adjourn on June 4. Committee work, drafting and assessing bills, dominates the first months.
Once committee deadlines pass in late April, the focus turns to floor votes in the House and Senate. Stewart missed House sessions on eight days from April 28 through Thursday, including three days this week.
The House is expected to hold floor votes on four days next week. Stewart has indicated hopes of being there, a GOP staff member said.
In his statement, Stewart said he intends to remain a member of the legislature in the seat he won with 54% of the vote in November.
“Despite these challenges, my commitment to serving our district remains unwavering,” Stewart said. “I continue to stay informed on daily proceedings of the legislature and am working toward a full return as soon as possible.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said both parties have had challenges with attendance at times.
“I have, certainly, especially post-COVID, when it was a little more difficult to get people back after getting more used to remote [work,]” Ritter said.
Legislators can participate and vote during committee members via video conferencing. A lawmaker can cast a House or Senate floor vote remotely, but only if they are in the Capitol or Legislative Office Building.
Minimum annual compensation for a House member is $48,100, which includes a salary of $43,600 and unvouchered expenses of $4,500.
Like every member of the General Assembly, Stewart essentially is an independent contractor answerable to the voters, not an employee who can be fired or have their pay docked by the House leadership.
“They are elected, duly elected, and they have to persuade people to vote for them,” Ritter said.
Candelora said Stewart’s situation is a complication of “a citizen-legislature that’s part time.”
“I still think that we are better off for it, because it brings different perspectives to the building that you wouldn’t otherwise have with a full-time legislature,” Candelora said. “But it does bring these kind of challenges.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STEWART-DESK-051425-SR-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-16 05:02:54.695995

Among the most worrisome bills under consideration in Raleigh this year is a Senate proposal that would weaken the state’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By removing a 2030 target for a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions, the bill takes another big step backward in confronting the global climate crisis.
But as Tom Ervin, a former judge and South Carolina Public Service Commission member noted in a recent op-ed for NC Newsline, there’s another reason for concern: the legislation’s likely impact on ratepayer electric bills.
As Ervin explained, under the proposal, utility giants Duke and Dominion would be allowed to charge their electric customers upfront for the costs of building new plants.
And when this happened in his state, consumers were left stuck with billions of dollars in sunk expenses to cover when a planned power plant went belly up.
The bottom line: According to our neighbor, big and expensive trouble is on the way for North Carolina unless lawmakers reject the utility industry gift. Let’s hope they’re listening.

[…],"""We have all heard about the budget cuts that have been suggested to save money but we must ask at what cost?"" (Getty Images)An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This legislative session has raised some concerns that not enough people understand that the best way to save money is to prevent the problem from ever even happening. We must emphasize this important life lesson to save existing prevention efforts and continue supporting our youth.
We have all heard about the budget cuts that have been suggested to save money but we must ask: At what cost? Primary health prevention shows, on the very low end, that every dollar invested in prevention saves on average $6 in health care costs. When we expand that to substance misuse prevention efforts the estimated cost savings climbs to as high as $12 to $18 for every dollar spent on providing information and awareness on the dangers of drugs and alcohol to children and teens.
New Hampshire prevention community coalitions and public health networks have been strategically working to lower the rates of substance misuse among our youth. It has taken time to build a strong network with qualified individuals who understand the process and how to effectively make change. The very foundation of this work and the infrastructure that helps keep it moving forward is in danger in many ways in our state at the moment.
First, let’s talk about House Bill 446, to make the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) that is administered to youth every two years and collects vitality important information, an opt-in survey. This means parents or guardians would have to sign a permission form for their child to participate in this survey. Currently there is a 10 day period prior to the survey that adults are made aware of the survey so they can review it and choose to opt their child out if they are uncomfortable with it. To be clear, the information collected in the survey is completely anonymous and on topics our youth are well versed in, curious about, and talking about, but are subjects their adults might find uncomfortable to talk about, like drug use, mental health, and sex.
The data collected in these surveys allows community coalitions who come together to support the youth growing up in their towns and cities to design messaging and programming to help support our youth making healthy choices and provide them with knowledge of where to go for help and support.
The needs identified also allow us to reach out to our partners across the state and share information and resources on how to best address these needs. This leads us to our next concern: the budget.
The New Hampshire Liquor Commission-Division of Enforcement (NHLE) is on the list of cuts in the current proposed budget. NHLE does so much behind the scene work to help with prevention but on a community-facing level they are the people we can call if we have a report of an establishment selling alcohol or tobacco to an underage buyer. They help us raise awareness that the legal age to purchase alcohol and tobacco is 21, and they are the ones who enforce these laws if they are broken.
The Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Program is also on the line to be cut. This department provides updated information and awareness resources for local community youth groups, schools, and organizations to share and raise awareness about the current threats around nicotine products, and their harmful effects on teens and adults alike. They also provide access to ways to quit for those who may be ready to take that next step toward a healthier lifestyle, such as 1-800-quit-now and My Life My Quit for teens.
The loss of even one of these tools (the YRBS, NHLE, or Tobacco Control) could drastically change the landscape of prevention work in New Hampshire. All three are vital tools in our New Hampshire prevention tool box to help keep our kids and communities safe from the unknown harms that can come with exploring substance misuse at a young age.
If you care about our young people, or you care about a budget that invests it money wisely to make a difference and save you money in the future, please speak up so the people who are invested in keeping kids, communities, and roads safe in New Hampshire can continue to do the great work they do — saving lives and limiting lifelong addiction.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/teenboy-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-16 05:02:54.695995

That includes 68% of his fellow Republicans and 56% of Democrats, according to the Gongwer-Werth Legislative Poll released Thursday.
It was conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, and 44 of the state’s 132 lawmakers responded.
In a related question, 35% said Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel would seek the 2026 Republican nomination to be governor, 47% said he wouldn’t, and 19% were undecided.
On the Democratic side, 33% of respondents said former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown would run for that body again next year. Twenty-six percent said he’d run for governor, and 42% were either undecided or said he’d run for neither seat.
A majority, 51%, said former U.S. Rep. and U.S. Senate candidate Tim Ryan would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Just 12% said he’d run for Senate again, and the rest were undecided or said he’d run for neither.
Former Ohio Department of Health director Dr. Amy Acton is currently the only Democratic primary candidate in the race.
At this point, the Republican race to succeed Gov. Mike DeWine is the topic of the most fervent speculation among the races surveyed. The Gongwer-Werth poll gives a peek at what’s being said among lawmakers.
Yost had been vying with former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted for the GOP nomination.

But businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, who is close to President Donald Trump, expressed an interest. Then Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Husted to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by J.D. Vance when he was elevated to the vice presidency. 
Trump endorsed Ramaswamy shortly after his inauguration, and then the Ohio Republican Party followed suit last Friday.
Ohio GOP endorses Vivek Ramaswamy for governor

While speculation rages about the future of the Yost campaign, Tressel remains a wild card. DeWine appointed him lieutenant governor after elevating Husted, and it was seen by some as a shrewd maneuver against a MAGA wing of the party with which DeWine has at times been at odds.
In early 2021, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed a bill that would weaken the governor’s ability to issue health orders. DeWine vetoed it and the legislature overrode his veto — even though he was at least nominally the head of the party in Ohio.
In 2023, Trump accused DeWine of having “fallen to the Radical Left” over his veto of a law that would ban gender-affirming care to minors. And DeWine last year published an op-ed in the New York Times criticizing Trump and Vance for promoting racist lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield.
Last week, Tressel confirmed that he was considering a run for governor.
As head coach of a national-championship-winning Ohio State football team, Tressel has high name recognition. And his mild demeanor might generate some crossover appeal.
Also, up to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Ramaswamy helped Elon Musk set up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. As it tries to slash funding and personnel for veterans benefits, Social Security, national parks, and public health, the unofficial agency might not be popular by the time voters start tuning into the governor’s race next year.
For his part, the Democrat Brown had held statewide office and was in the U.S. Congress when he ousted DeWine from his U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Brown held it until November, when he lost to Cleveland car dealer Bernie Moreno in one of the most expensive races in history.
Brown hasn’t ruled out running again for Senate — where he would face Husted next year — or for governor.
Ryan, who lost to Vance in 2022 by a six-point margin, said he’d make a decision this summer about again running for statewide office.

Supporters contend lawmakers have been unwilling or unable to make significant enough changes as property taxes climb. But critics warn eliminating that revenue stream could cripple important services like schools and first responders.
Campaign reaction

The day after the ballot board meeting, Beth Blackmarr described her mood as ‘busy.’
“Busy, busy, busy,” she said, “I mean, here we go — we’ve got to hit the ground running.”
Blackmarr is part of the organization Citizens for Property Tax Reform which is leading the repeal campaign. With the ballot board’s decision, the group is now able to start gathering signatures to appear on the ballot.
To go before voters, they’ll need 10% of the electoral turnout from the last governor’s race (just shy of 415,000). Additionally, in 44 of Ohio’s counties, they’ll need signatures from at least 5% of the governor’s race turnout. In practice, campaigns turn in hundreds of thousands more signatures than necessary to make up for any rejections.
Blackmarr said they want to start collecting “as soon as humanly possible,” and work could begin as early as next week. Asked whether they’d work with paid circulators, she just laughed.
“Many of us are youthful at heart, but senior citizens that are just really working out of our pockets,” she said. “There’s no big money backing this at all. It’s all volunteer.”
What would happen if Ohio abolished property taxes?

The merits
Blackmarr argued Ohio’s current property tax system is broken. She points to other states like New Jersey and Texas that have far more generous initiatives to keep seniors, vets and the disabled in their homes.
“You can’t have senior citizens who have paid for their homes — fully paid for — having to move out because they can’t afford property tax,” she insisted.
Blackmarr contends those kinds of protections are low-hanging fruit. Lawmakers have had continual warnings and “ample opportunity” to act. Instead, she argued, they’ve dithered with changes at the margins.
“I suspect it’s because they built a wobbly tower of property tax law over these decades,” she said, “and they’re afraid to pull one of the blocks out, because they’re afraid the whole thing’s gonna come tumbling down.”
That ‘tumbling down’ is exactly the concern many critics voice about the plan. The most recent annual report from the Ohio Department of Taxation puts 2023 property tax collections at about $18.5 billion. That’s an enormous amount of funding to just disappear. It’s roughly double the amount reported for state income taxes, and a billion more than Ohio’s sales and use tax.
Spread evenly, it would cost every single Ohioan more than $1,500 to make up that gap in funding.
Blackmarr argued repeal will just force lawmakers “to come up with an alternative.” But that’s a big ask — particularly for Republicans allergic to tax increases.
Still she’s right about dramatic increases in property taxes. The same Department of Taxation report shows assessed values climbing almost 40% in five years while tax collections have risen more than 21%.
Legislature’s role
In a statement following the ballot board decision, House minority leader Allison Russo said the proposal “clearly demonstrates frustration by Ohioans on this issue” and blamed lawmakers for failing to act.
“However, this particular initiative concerns me because while it eliminates the property tax, it doesn’t explain how we’ll replace the funds that support police, fire departments, public education, and other critical services,” she said.
Russo argued Democrats have signed on to bipartisan legislation providing direct relief but Republican leaders haven’t prioritized those bills.
Blackmarr acknowledged that as their campaign gains steam, pressure will grow on lawmakers to pass legislation or propose their own ballot measure to undercut their efforts.
“At the end of the day it goes to the voters,” she said.  “They have to make the decision for themselves.”
And if lawmakers’ intervention means voters have to choose between competing visions, that’s just fine with Blackmarr.
“Wouldn’t that be nice, you know?” she said.

Ohio’s 2023 two-year state budget allocated $24 million for the centers — $5 million each fiscal year to Ohio State University, $1 million each fiscal year to the University of Toledo and $2 million each fiscal year for each center at Miami University, Cleveland State University and Wright State University. 
The centers at Ohio State, Miami, Cleveland State and Wright State “shall conduct teaching and research in the historical ideas, traditions, and texts that have shaped the American constitutional order and society,” according to the law.
The University of Toledo’s institute is “established for the purpose of creating and disseminating knowledge about American constitutional thought and to form future leaders of the legal profession through research, scholarship, teaching, collaboration, and mentorship,” according to the law.  
Ohio State University 
The Salmon P. Chase Center for Civics, Culture, and Society will start offering classes in the fall semester including three versions of an American Civic Tradition Class, said university spokesperson Chris Booker. The Chase Center is housed in the John Glenn College of Public Affairs.
Lee Strang was named the executive director of the Chase Center last summer. He previously was the director at the University of Toledo Institute of American Constitutional Thought and Leadership. 
The Chase Center — which will have at least 15 tenure-track faculty members — is in the process of hiring faculty, Booker said. 
The center has already hosted several events, including a conversation with Ohio State President Ted Carter.
Ohio State’s University Senate voted against a proposal to formally establish the Chase Center back in January, according to The Columbus Dispatch. 
“While we respect the voice of the senate, we were disappointed in the vote,” Booker said in an email. “The Chase Center was established in 2023 by the state of Ohio via statute, and Ohio State must develop and operate the center in line with those legal requirements.”
University of Toledo 
Nine courses have been offered through Toledo’s institute since the 2024 summer semester including the art of statesmanship, the art of rhetoric, civic discourse, competing theories of justice, and model U.S. Senate, said university spokesperson Nicki Gorny. 
The institute plans on adding a couple American civics courses this upcoming school year and has hosted more than a dozen public lectures and debates since January 2024, Gorny said. 
Jonathan Culp from the University of Dallas will become the institute’s new director in July. Michael Gonzalez is currently the institute’s interim director. 
Miami University 
Flagg Taylor was recently named the executive director of Miami’s Center for Civics, Culture, and Society. He was approved as the director in April and he previously was a political science professor at Skidmore University in New York. 
Miami’s center will be in the College of Arts and Science and will operate alongside the university’s Menard Family Center for Democracy. 
The university is planning to offer classes through the center this fall, university spokesperson Seth Bauguess said. 
Wright State University 
Wright State hopes to start offering classes through the university’s Center for Civics, Culture and Workforce Development in fall 2026, said university spokesperson Bob Mihalek. Proposed courses could include American civic literacy, from idea to law: an experiential journey through the legislative process and upholding the constitution: exploring your oath, Mihalek said.
Jason Anderson was chosen as the center’s executive director. He is a retired Air Force veteran and a former faculty member with the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  
Cleveland State University 
Peter Koritansky was picked to be the director of the university’s Center for Civics, Culture and Society and his first day will be June 1, said university spokesperson Kristin Broka. He is currently a professor at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada. 
The center will be housed in the Levin College of Public Affairs and Education.

(Eric Thomas/Kansas Reflector)Five years ago today, University of Kansas senior Caroline McCray woke up and connected through the internet to a remote yoga class. She practiced the poses in her mom’s kitchen, family dogs at her feet. 
For McCray, May 16, 2020, was a typical Saturday in Fairway during the COVID-19 lockdown.
She finished her yoga class and saw something unusual out the front window of her home. Foot-high letters in the front yard read “YAY LELA!” along with stars and a smiley face wearing a graduation cap. A celebration coordinated by her mom also featured McCray’s sister and boyfriend, plus mimosas during an outdoor brunch that morning. 
McCray posted photos from the day on Instagram. The caption: “this year’s graduation ceremony consists of yoga clothes and dogs.”
“I think as a 21-year-old college student at the time, I was still kind of sad not to be with my friends,” McCray said this week. “But I only have good memories from the morning, and looking back on it now, those are still the three most important people to me.” 
If the pandemic had not forced the closure of campuses at KU and hundreds of other universities, the weekend of May 16, 2020 would have been a raucous and jam-packed graduation weekend. Instead, the class of 2020 — from kindergarten to PhD graduates — celebrated remotely and modestly. 
If not for the pandemic, McCray and thousands of fellow KU students would have descended the “Hill” on the Lawrence campus from the Memorial Campanile to the football stadium. Prospective Jayhawks often hear about the campanile tradition during campus tours, before they even apply to KU. 
“If you walk under the bell tower,” they are told about the superstition, “you won’t graduate on time. Or maybe never graduate.”
As a KU instructor, I have been thinking about the class of 2020 this week on the five-year anniversary of their not-so-graduation ceremony. In many ways, this weekend’s graduates, the class of 2025, will have the commencement that the class of 2020 envisioned. 
Putting on make-up and fine tuning your hair with your roommates. Gathering on Jayhawk Boulevard and running into four years’ worth of friends. Snapping pictures by (or in) the Chi Omega fountain. Popping open champagne with whoops and cheers. Spending one last night at your favorite Mass Street bar.  
Curious about how the canceled in-person graduation looked to the Class of 2020 with the distance of five years, I interviewed students from my documentary class held that 2020 spring semester. 
The class, like graduation itself, ended with a thud. We had arranged to tag along with Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas as he managed the city and taught at the KU Law School. The pandemic mangled our plans for that documentary project. The mayor’s office couldn’t invite a student-journalist film crew to tag along as the city hunkered down.
Students in the class pivoted to creating podcasts about fellow students, asking them about their pandemic realities. Emily Beckman, who earned bachelor’s degrees in journalism and women, gender and sexuality, said this week that those interviews stuck with her. 
“I would check in with four students regularly to hear how they were navigating lockdown,” Beckman said. “There was something so human about knowing we were all moving through a time of major uncertainty and isolation together.”

Riley Wilson, who came to KU after graduating from Wamego High School and is now a lawyer in Texas, remembers returning to campus in June, a month after graduation because there was no in-person option. 
“We went to campus later with just me and my family,” Wilson said. “I had my graduation stuff on, and my mom took pictures of me, and I did get one in the bell tower. I got to walk through the bell tower, but instead of it being with all my friends, it was with my family. So it was just a very different experience.”
Five years later, she had forgotten about the bell tower tradition until it came up in our interview.
“Had graduation happened the way I thought it was going to, (the bell tower) would have been one of the first things that I would talk about with anyone,” Wilson said, “You finally get to walk through the bell tower and signify that you’re graduated.”
In April 2020, the news that in-person graduation was canceled wasn’t a surprise to Wilson and McCray. Both agree that it was the safest choice, especially because traveling and flying was seen as particularly risky. 
“Once other schools started canceling, I had the feeling that it was going to happen and definitely was bummed,” McCray said. “I think at that point, I knew that my family wasn’t going to be in town anyways. So I guess I wasn’t super shocked at that point, just because I saw it coming.”
Five years later, she describes the canceled graduation as feeling like “loose ends.”
Graduation “was supposed to be like our last celebration of college,” McCray said. “No one was mad or upset about having some classes online. But (graduation) was definitely more of a celebration that we didn’t get to have.”
Wilson’s brother was graduating high school the same weekend, and she remembers her family bracing for the possibility of a hectic weekend. 
“I remember thinking that that was going to be really exciting and fun too, because we could do that together and have everybody there that we wanted to be surrounded by, all in one place for a weekend full of celebration and fun things,” Wilson said.
On commencement weekend 2020, the university offered a video that graduates could stream online in place of the in-person ceremony. The 35-minute video presented congratulations from men’s basketball coach Bill Self, actor Rob Riggle and assorted university faculty. It also provided a performance of the alma mater, “Crimson and the Blue,” lyrics laid over campus scenery. 
“I remember being bummed that it was on YouTube,” Wilson said. “I mean, I knew that there was nothing else that the university could do. They were doing the best that they could, given the fact that we can’t gather together.”
Watching the commencement video today, it’s perhaps more emotional than in 2020. The chorus of the “Rock Chalk,” chanted by a Brady-Bunch screen-collage of students, nearly brought me to tears while rewatching it this week. Plus, the script addresses the sadness of an empty campus in an honest way. 
“For so many of us, the distance on our minds was not the one that we kept from each other, but the one from a campanile to a stadium full of friends and family,” the video narrates over footage of student life. “It can be easy to dwell on the steps that you won’t take, but pause now to think of the strides you’ve made.”
The video may work better as an emotional time capsule today than it did in 2020 as a huzzah for new graduates. 
Beckman watched that video on commencement day and also attended the in-person graduation the next year, because KU allowed 2020 graduates to attend in May 2021. 
“It felt so special to walk down the hill and celebrate my time at KU in a meaningful way, with family in attendance,” Beckman said. 
As Wilson and McCray see it now, other ripple effects from the pandemic were far more disruptive and consequential than the graduation decision. 
As a new graduate, McCray hoped to find a job with a professional sports team in the summer of 2020. She was on the right trajectory after working for Sporting Kansas City and a Kansas City radio station. The pandemic scrambled that. 
Because sports teams couldn’t sell tickets to in-person events, they laid off employees rather than hiring new ones like McCray. 
“After a year, I said, ‘Okay, you know, maybe this isn’t happening,’” McCray said. “COVID in general at the time did make a very, very significant impact on my career. I didn’t end up doing what I always thought I was going to do because of it.”
McCray now works from Denver in the travel industry, a job that she loves for its flexibility. Just a few days ago, she married that boyfriend from her senior year — the one who made the road trip to share brunch with her. 
Wilson remembers how difficult the pandemic was on college friendships, like the one she had with her senior year roommate. One day you were living together. The next day you didn’t see one another at all. 
“Someone who I had lived with for four years was now like … I didn’t live with her anymore, and all our stuff was still at our town home,” Wilson said, remembering of her trip back to campus to move out. “We were just overnight separated. She had to go back to St. Louis, and I had to go back to Wamego. Someone who I had lived my life with for the past four years — we were just separated.”
Three years after moving out of that town home, Wilson graduated from law school. That ceremony showed her what she had missed in 2020. 
“Being able to be there with your classmates, all in the same place, and just really excited and nervous all together,” Wilson recalls. “And then you get to walk out into the auditorium and you see the thousands of people around you there to support everyone. I think that is what makes it so special.”
Wilson is reciting a sacred graduation recipe: a campus you cherish, the people you love and a coveted diploma. Graduations make memories.

Look closely at your mobile phone or tablet. Touch-screen technology, speech recognition, digital sound recording and the internet were all developed using funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation.
No matter where you live, NSF-supported research has also made your life safer. Engineering studies have reduced earthquake damage and fatalities through better building design. Improved hurricane and tornado forecasts reflect NSF investment in environmental monitoring and computer modeling of weather. NSF-supported resilience studies reduce risks and losses from wildfires.
Using NSF funding, scientists have done research that amazes, entertains and enthralls. They have drilled through mile-thick ice sheets to understand the past, visited the wreck of the Titanic and captured images of deep space.
NSF investments have made America and American science great. At least 268 Nobel laureates received NSF grants during their careers. The foundation has partnered with agencies across the government since it was created, including those dealing with national security and space exploration. The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% since 1950, meaning for every dollar U.S. taxpayers invested, they got back between $1.50 and $3.
However, that funding is now at risk.
Since January, layoffs, leadership resignations and a massive proposed reorganization have threatened the integrity and mission of the National Science Foundation. Hundreds of research grants have been terminated. The administration’s proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2026 would cut NSF’s funding by 55%, an unprecedented reduction that would end federal support for science research across a wide range of discipines.
At my own geology lab, I have seen NSF grants catalyze research and the work of dozens of students who have collected data that’s now used to reduce risks from earthquakes, floods, landslides, erosion, sea-level rise and melting glaciers.
I have also served on advisory committees and review panels for the NSF over the past 30 years and have seen the value the foundation produces for the American people.
 American science’s greatness stemmed from war

In the 1940s, with the advent of nuclear weapons, the space race and the intensification of the Cold War, American science and engineering expertise became increasingly critical for national defense. At the time, most basic and applied research was done by the military.
Vannevar Bush, an electrical engineer who oversaw military research efforts during World War II, including development of the atomic bomb, had a different idea.
He articulated an expansive scientific vision for the United States in Science: The Endless Frontier. The report was a blueprint for an American research juggernaut grounded in the expertise of university faculty, staff and graduate students.
On May 10, 1950, after five years of debate and compromise, President Harry Truman signed legislation creating the National Science Foundation and putting Bush’s vision to work. Since then, the foundation has become the leading funder of basic research in the United States.
NSF’s mandate, then as now, was to support basic research and spread funding for science across all 50 states. Expanding America’s scientific workforce was and remains integral to American prosperity. By 1952, the foundation was awarding merit fellowships to graduate and postdoctoral scientists from every state.
There were compromises. Control of NSF rested with presidential appointees, disappointing Bush. He wanted scientists in charge to avoid political interference with the foundation’s research agenda.
 NSF funding matters to everyone, everywhere

Today, American tax dollars supporting science go to every state in the union.
The states with the most NSF grants awarded between 2011 and 2024 include several that voted Republican in the 2024 election – Texas, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania – and several that voted Democratic, including Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Colorado.
More than 1,800 public and private institutions, scattered across all 50 states, receive NSF funding. The grants pay the salaries of staff, faculty and students, boosting local employment and supporting college towns and cities. For states with major research universities, those grants add up to hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Even states with few universities each see tens of millions of dollars for research.
As NSF grant recipients purchase lab supplies and services, those dollars support regional and national economies.
When NSF budgets are cut and grants are terminated or never awarded, the harm trickles down and communities suffer. Initial NSF funding cuts are already rippling across the country, affecting both national and local economies in red, blue and purple states alike.
An analysis of a February 2025 proposal that would cut about US$5.5 billion from National Institutes of Health grants estimated the ripple effect through college towns and supply chains would cost $6.1 billion in GDP, or total national productivity, and over 46,000 jobs.
 An uncertain future for American science

America’s scientific research and training enterprise has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. Yet, as NSF celebrates its 75th birthday, the future of American science is in doubt. Funding is increasingly uncertain, and politics is driving decisions, as Bush feared 80 years ago.
A list of grants terminated by the Trump administration, collected both from government websites and scientists themselves, shows that by early May 2025, NSF had stopped funding more than 1,400 existing grants, totaling over a billion dollars of support for research, research training and education.
Most terminated grants focused on education – the core of science, technology and engineering workforce development critical for supplying highly skilled workers to American companies. For example, NSF provided 1,000 fewer graduate student fellowships in 2025 than in the decade before − a 50% drop in support for America’s best science students.
American scientists are responding to NSF’s downsizing in diverse ways. Some are pushing back by challenging grant terminations. Others are preparing to leave science or academia. Some are likely to move abroad, taking offers from other nations to recruit American experts. Science organizations and six prior heads of the NSF are calling on Congress to step up and maintain funding for science research and workforce development.
If these losses continue, the next generation of American scientists will be fewer in number and less well prepared to address the needs of a population facing the threat of more extreme weather, future pandemics and the limits to growth imposed by finite natural resources and other planetary limits.
Investing in science and engineering is an investment in America. Diminishing NSF and the science it supports will hurt the American economy and the lives of all Americans.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
Shaken by post-pandemic disruptions, some states take a harder line on school discipline

In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.










Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project


During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
 Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
 Calls for a cultural shift on expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.










Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.


Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”
