(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)When Utah Democrats gathered at Ogden High School for their organizing convention on Saturday, the school hallways loudly echoed the voices of 600 delegates registering and debating whether an established politician or a newcomer had what it takes to transform red districts into blue after the departure of Diane Lewis, who had been in the role for the last four years.
Ultimately, that was decided by thin margins, when 52% of delegates voted Brian King to be the new Utah Democratic Party chair, a choice that reflected the party’s desire to trust widely known names to support its goal of gaining prominence in bright red Utah. 
“This isn’t just some abstract policy debate. What we’re talking about is happening right now,” King said during his pitch. “It’s parents losing their Medicaid coverage. It’s students being told what they can’t study. It’s immigrants being detained without due process and deported. It’s workers picking up the tab while billionaires cash in.”
King, who was a state representative from 2009 to 2024, when he quit to run for governor, highlighted his experience, saying he has been in the party long enough to know the dedication and planning needed to achieve its goals. He has also raised money and has cultivated important relationships across the state.
Utah Democrats to choose between seasoned legislator and young campaigner as new leader

 
He also committed to getting his hands dirty and filling up his calendar to show real progress.
“I’ve been able to stand on the House floor and say to the Republican supermajority, call them out for what they are, extremists who are out of touch with the values of Utah,” King said. “I took on the governor on the fake stage, and I told the truth. I said, ‘He’s not a leader. He’s a lapdog for the legislature.’”
In a statement after his win, King commended the convention’s turnout, saying it was a demonstration of Utah Democrats’ energy, motivation and readiness to fight for their values.
“This is a new era and this is our moment. As chair, I’m ready to lead the charge to hold out-of-touch Republicans accountable, to connect with voters across the state and political spectrum, and to flip seats from the top of the ballot to the bottom,” King said. “Monopolies, in politics and otherwise, aren’t good for anyone and Utahns deserve better.”
The day started early with caucus meetings, as cars filled up the school’s parking lot and neighboring streets. While it’s not an election year, delegates were fiery as party leaders and candidates mentioned some of the flagship policies the Republican Party has implemented in the state’s Legislature and, most recently, since President Donald Trump took office this year — immigration, Medicaid cuts, book bans and controversial culture war issues.
From the prayer to the candidates’ speeches, Democrats expressed profound concerns on the political status of the country under Trump’s direction, with some describing it as “being at war.”

While about 600 delegates showed up in person for the convention, 1,450 voted with the availability of digital ballots — a record number, the party said in a news release.
Tara Benally, who traveled with her mom from the Utah portion of the Navajo Nation in San Juan County for the convention, said she hoped to get more representation in rural areas out of the leadership change.
“Not many people are aware of what’s happening today or what’s going on within the state, because a lot of information stops somewhere along the way and just doesn’t get disseminated,” she said.
Especially, she added, when tribes are so deeply concerned with the status of public lands, the expansion of extractive industries, and the transportation of uranium through their neighborhoods.
“What is being done to help resolve a lot of the emergency issues that have been brought? What has been done to help monitor the air quality? A lot of these things we hear up in the Wasatch Front, but have not come down to our area,” Benally said. “When is that going to happen?”

A couple of hours before the voting started, the candidates made their pitches to delegates, with King arguing that the choices they made on Saturday would define the state and the party for years to come, as many started to pay attention to real impacts of policy coming out of the White House and the Legislature. 
Ben Peck, a young campaigner and former executive director of the Salt Lake County Democratic Party, highlighted his track record running campaigns that led to the election of Democrats including Natalie Pinkney in a tight race for the Salt Lake County Council, Sheila Srivastava, the first woman elected to serve as Salt Lake County treasurer, and Rosalba Dominguez, a freshman Utah House representative.
“Our democracy is facing an existential crisis. We need a party that acts like that. We don’t have time for part-time leaders anymore. We need a leader of our party whose full-time job is being the leader, building our party,” Peck said. 
Other candidates for the role, Archie Williams III and Jonathan Lopez, also made their case, however, but fell well below King and Peck in the in-person support.
The party also voted to approve a platform highlighting values they hope to lift up, including economic security, equality of opportunity, investing in the common good, and American leadership. Additionally, it overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning efforts to extend presidential tenure beyond two terms, as well as denouncing mass workforce reduction and benefit cuts in the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Jim Clyburn’s World Famous Fish Fry, an annual gathering of South Carolina Democrats, on Friday, May 30, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA, S.C. — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care, and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes Rep. Jim Clyburn’s (D-S.C.) annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.
“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the state Democratic Party’s Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.

“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined suggestions that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.
Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said of Moore and Walz.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event. “I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four.”
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset. Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.

Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. But they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, had asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker at Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner because of the veto. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tonya Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 people with convictions for cannabis possession, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Game and Parks Commission)LINCOLN — One of Nebraska’s oldest trees has died, and officials are blaming drought conditions.
The “Old Wolf Oak,” a burr oak with a 9.8-foot circumference located along a hiking trail at Ponca State Park, was estimated to be more than 380 years old.
The tree was a popular stop for park visitors, given that it was 223 years old when Nebraska became a state in 1867 and was a silent witness to the Lewis & Clark Expedition of 1804-06.
But Nebraska Game and Parks Commission officials say drought conditions in eastern Nebraska have created large areas of dead or declining mature trees, including the stately oak.
The past two years have seen extreme drought across Nebraska, officials said. While native species like the bur oak are drought-tolerant, prolonged drought causes dieback in the canopy and root systems, weakening tree defenses.
This creates an opening for pests and pathogens, officials said, and makes a tree more vulnerable to infection.
Game and Parks staff had been monitoring and, where possible, treating bur oaks for bur oak blight, which can weaken a tree. Officials also identified a new threat to trees, hypoxylon canker, a fungus that invades the vascular systems of drought-stricken trees and dooms a tree.
The old oak will soon be cut down under a response plan developed after consulting with experts, Game and Parks announced. Infected material must be destroyed on-site, officials said, to avoid stressing the surrounding healthy trees.
A sign at the Wolf Oak, erected in 1964, states that it “began its life in 1644.” But more modern dating techniques later added another half century to its age.
Ironically, it was not a state champion tree in its category. A registry kept by the Nebraska Forest Service lists a burr oak with a circumference of 18.7 feet near Peru as the state champion.

Using flawed studies and scientific journal publications, abortion opponents are building a body of research meant to question the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, a key target for the movement.
The effort comes as federal officials have expressed a willingness to revisit the drug’s approval — and potentially impose new restrictions on a medication used in the vast majority of abortions.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Mainstream medical researchers have criticized the studies, highlighting flaws in their methodology and — in the case of one paper published by the conservative think tank Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC) — lack of transparency about the data used to suggest mifepristone is unsafe. The vast body of research shows that the drugs used in medication abortion, mifepristone and misoprostol, are safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy.
“There’s a proliferation of anti-abortion propaganda right now. I think it is a coordinated attack on mifepristone,” said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco who studies medication abortion.
Released in April, the EPPC paper suggests that mifepristone results in serious adverse events for 1 in 10 patients — substantially higher than the widely accepted figure of .3 percent complication rate most research has attributed to the pill. The paper appears to count what other researchers say are non-threatening events, such as requiring follow-up care to complete the abortion, or visiting an emergency room within 45 days of an abortion — even if the patient did not end up requiring emergency care — as serious adverse effects. That paper also did not go through peer review, a standard process for scientific research in which other scholars review a study’s findings and methodology before it can be published.
Another paper, a commentary piece published this week in the journal BioTech, challenges the commonly cited statistic that mifepristone has a lower complication rate than acetaminophen, or Tylenol, tracing the history of the comparison and arguing that it is mathematically flawed. The paper’s author, Cameron Loutitt, is a biomedical engineer by training and director of life sciences at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a research arm of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“My hope is that this paper sparks action in my peers in the research and medical community to more critically evaluate these unfounded claims regarding abortion drug safety,” Loutitt said in a statement.
Days later, a group of researchers from the institute published another study, this one arguing that emergency rooms are likely to identify medication abortions as miscarriages, which they say increases the risk of needing hospital care.
A miscarriage and a medication abortion are medically indistinguishable, and patients will sometimes visit an emergency room to ensure the drugs worked, or if they suspect possible complications. In places where abortion is illegal, patients may also tell health care providers they experienced a miscarriage to minimize their legal risk. Studies like the Lozier Institute paper suggest complications from medication abortions are being undercounted.
That study was rejected by another journal on April 12 before being published this week, noted Upadhyay, who had served as a peer reviewer in that rejection process. A similar paper written by many of the same researchers behind the Lozier Institute’s was retracted a year ago by the journal that published it, along with two others suggesting mifepristone was unsafe.
“They keep trying to publish the same junk science,” Upadhyay said.
James Studnicki, the Charlotte Lozier Institute’s director of data analytics, who led the second of its new anti-abortion papers and the study retracted last year, did not respond to a request for comment. But a spokesperson for the institute said the organization is challenging last year’s retraction through an arbitration process. This March, Studnicki said in a statement that the retraction placed “politics over publication ethics.”
These studies and papers all fall outside the scientific consensus. More than 100 studies over decades of research have found that mifepristone — and the medication abortion regimen as a whole — has a low complication rate and is very safe to use for abortions. Papers like these aren’t new, and their scientific accuracy has long been questioned. But the bevy of new reports and analyses comes at a moment when abortion opponents may have more influence in shaping public policy.

Mifepristone restrictions are a top priority for the anti-abortion movement. About two-thirds of all abortions in the United States are now done using medication. Even in states with abortion bans, pregnant people have increasingly turned to abortion medication, which they receive from health providers in states with laws protecting abortion.
Nationwide, about 1 in 5 abortions are now performed using telehealth; almost half of those are for people in states with bans or restrictions. Mifepristone is currently approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before a Senate committee that he has directed the Food and Drug Administration to review the approval of mifepristone, citing the EPPC paper specifically. Jim O’Neill, who is nominated for a deputy secretary role, has also said he is in favor of a “safety review” of the drug — a move that could result in new restrictions on how it is prescribed.
Meanwhile, physicians and researchers are highlighting the rigor of the FDA approval process.
“FDA approval of mifepristone must reflect the rigorous clinical evidence that has proven unequivocally that it is safe and effective for use in medication,” 13 reproductive medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, said in a statement after Kennedy indicated the drug may undergo a new FDA review. “Mifepristone has been used for decades for abortion and miscarriage management by millions of patients, and complications are exceedingly rare, minor, and most often easily treatable.”
The International Institute for Reproductive Loss, an anti-abortion nonprofit, has explicitly prioritized the publication of research that supports restrictions on medication abortion. Presenting at an anti-abortion conference last September, that organization’s science director, Priscilla Coleman, highlighted strategies that she said could help result in the retraction of studies showing mifepristone’s safety, such as finding “agenda-driven, poorly developed and conducted studies published in peer-reviewed journals” and writing to journal editors. Coleman did not respond to a request for comment.
Though no scientific consensus has changed, anti-abortion lawmakers have rallied around the suggestion that complications are common. In a private Zoom meeting reported on by Politico, abortion opponents cited the EPPC paper as a potential tool to justify further restrictions on mifepristone — even while acknowledging that the report is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”
Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the EPPC paper in a letter to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who had only a day before the report’s publication indicated openness to reviewing mifepristone’s approval if new evidence emerged.
“The time to act is now. It is time to revisit and restore the FDA’s longstanding safety measures governing mifepristone,” Hawley wrote. His office did not reply to a request for further comment.
“They’re producing this terrible ‘science’ because they don’t have any real science that backs them up. And all they’ve gotten from the administration is, ‘Yeah, we’ll study it,’”  said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who has advised state legislatures on crafting abortion-protetctive laws.
Through the courts and Trump administration, abortion opponents have pushed to reverse a 2021 FDA decision allowing mifepristone to be distributed via telehealth. In addition to calling for the in-person requirement to be reinstated, abortion opponents are asking for restrictions such as the dispensation of the drug to require three in-person visits, and for mifepristone to only be approved for use only in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Many have also argued the drug should be taken off the market entirely.
The Trump administration said on the campaign trail that it would leave abortion policy up to the states. So far, there has been little indication from the federal government that such changes are imminent.
“Pills are kind of just spreading, as we predicted, without almost any restriction and so far the anti-abortion movement hasn’t figured out what to do,” Cohen said.

While Nevada’s elected leaders have expressed a commitment to addressing the climate crisis, a new proposal under consideration raises questions about our state’s priorities. The proposed expansion of Nevada’s film tax credit program, which would direct hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies to Hollywood studios, risks sidelining urgent environmental and climate needs. At a time when bold action is needed to protect our communities and natural resources, this approach feels out of step.
It’s abundantly clear that Nevada is in a climate emergency. Wildfires are burning hotter and longer, filling our summers with smokey skies. Land managers warn this summer could bring catastrophic wildfires. The Great Basin is drying, and Lake Mead is sitting at thirty percent full. Communities from Las Vegas to Reno are enduring extreme heat, toxic air, and prolonged drought, and hundreds to thousands of Nevadans are dying each year as a result. We have proposed projects to protect our public lands, prevent extinction, and invest in sustainable transit, but we’re told there’s “no money.”


The proposal would allocate $95 million in annual transferable film tax credits for 15 years beginning in 2028, expanding our already-existing tax giveaways. The proposal will kick into place in 2028, and yet we have no way to know what our fiscal situation will be at that point in time. Just think of the roller coaster ride the 2020’s have been so far, and the looming federal budget that could have sweeping impacts to Nevada’s fiscal viability. Meanwhile, extreme heat is only getting worse, the Colorado River and Lake Mead are only getting drier, and our special places are only becoming more threatened.




Our organization has spent years fighting for clean air protections, better public transportation, rooftop solar access, and the preservation of special landscapes like Red Rock National Conservation Area and Lake Tahoe. We’re constantly met with budgetary constraints, told to be patient, to compromise. And yet the same state that balks at funding protections for pollinators and soil health is ready to roll out a red carpet for corporate film giants.
Supporters of the film credit expansion claim it will bring jobs and economic growth, but as the independent economists at Applied Economics reported, the state would have a negative return on investment. States across the country have learned the hard way that film subsidies rarely pay off. Meanwhile, climate investments create durable jobs, foster resilience, and protect our future. Where are the investments for fighting wildfires, restoring wetlands, or public transportation?
If Nevada has hundreds of millions of dollars to spend, let’s spend it on the people and places that make this state worth living in, and ensure it will be livable in the next several decades, not on fleeting glitz and glamour. Let’s fund the transition to a clean energy economy, build transit-to-trails networks, restore our watersheds, and protect the wild lands that make Nevada extraordinary.
We have shelled out enough for corporations working against our interests. Why do we give tax handouts to the Boring Tunnel instead of funding mass transit? Why do water intensive data centers get huge tax breaks when we can’t get funding for water conservation? Why did we give millions of dollars to build the A’s stadium in the Las Vegas core when we can’t get funding for urban forestry and mitigating urban heat?
This proposed tax credit isn’t just a bad policy. It’s a missed opportunity to lead. Nevada should act in the best interests of those who live here, instead of enacting Hollywood handouts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1421734795-scaled-e1732293900334-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-31 15:03:28.216641

A Kodiak man has been sentenced to jail for illegally transporting Alaska crab out of state. (Photo provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service)A Kodiak fisher has been sentenced to spend a year in jail for illegally shipping thousands of pounds of tanner crab, much of it infected with a parasitic disease, out of Alaska to Washington state, federal officials said.
The fisherman, Corey Potter, was also sentenced to two years’ supervised release following his jail term, during which he will be barred from commercial fishing anywhere in the world, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The investigation was led by NOAA Fisheries’ Office of Law Enforcement. The sentence was imposed on May 13 by U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Burgess in Anchorage.
The case concerns tanner and Golden king crab harvested in 2024 in Southeast Alaska. Potter owned two vessels, one of them captained by his son, Kyle Potter, and the other by employee Justin Welch.
Rather than unload the crab catch in Alaska, as is required by state law, the three men kept the live crab in the vessels and took the catch to Washington state, passing through Canadian waters along the way. The motivation was to fetch higher prices for their catch, according to prosecutors’ documents.
At the time, according to evidence presented in court documents, the men knew that a large proportion of the catch was infested with Bitter Crab Syndrome, a parasitic disease that usually kills the crabs and renders their meat inedible. Bitter Crab Syndrome is not toxic for people, but infected crab meat can be bitter and eating it is likened to chewing on aspirin.
That evidence included text messages from other Alaska fishers who cautioned Potter and his son against bringing infested crab to market, with one expressing concerns that their actions would hurt the reputation and marketability of all Alaska crab.

	Bitter Crab Syndrome affects numerous species, and it is considered a possible contributor to the crash of Bering Sea snow crab and king crab stocks that led to an unprecedented string of harvest closures between 2021 and 2024. The main reason for the stock crashes, scientists believe, was the warmth in the habitat, which led to crab starvation. In the years leading up to the fishery closures, however, there was an increase in Bitter Crab Syndrome. The disease is linked to warming waters and climate change, according to scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Kyle Potter and Welch pleaded guilty last year. In October, Kyle Potter was sentenced to five years’ probation and ordered to pay a $20,000 fine; Welch was sentenced to three years’ probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
Ultimately, the loads of crab they delivered never made it to any market. They were seized by Washington state law enforcement officers and deemed unfit for sale or consumption. Of the Golden king crab, 42% of the catch was dead upon arrival; of the tanner crab, so much was infested that the entire load was disposed of in a landfill, federal officials said.
Potter pleaded guilty in February to two counts of violating the Lacey Act, the federal law that concerns transport of wildlife and fish across state lines. Prosecutors identified him as the leader of the scheme and therefore requested heavier penalties.
Potter, in a presentencing memorandum, asked for probation rather than jail time, arguing that his long career of fishing in Alaska has now ended and that at the age of 64, he is now financially ruined. “As a result of last year’s terrible crabbing season, which included the instant offense conduct, he has been financially destroyed. One of the boats involved in this offense was foreclosed on, and the other is believed to have been seized by the state. He has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” the May 6 defense memo said.
But prosecutors, who argued for 18 months imprisonment, said actions with the diseased crab fit Potter’s yearslong pattern of sloppy maintenance and unsafe behavior.
In their presentencing report, also filed on May 6, prosecutors listed numerous past problems with the vessels Potter owned. They have been cited for chronically leaking oil, broken down at sea – requiring crew members to be rescued – and sunk in different sites, the report said.
“The defendant’s track record as a vessel operator in Alaska is abysmal. He has shown a total disregard for the safety of his crew, the safety of Alaskan waterways, and the health of the marine environment,” the prosecutors’ presentencing report said.
Yet to be determined is the amount of restitution that Potter will be ordered to pay for the trafficked crab. The government is seeking $187,187 in restitution. A hearing on that subject is set for July 15.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1280_EvN4ANCaZ2z3.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Minutes before 10 p.m. Friday, after Democratic speakers led the audience in jeers to Republicans’ efforts to slash jobs and health care and encouraged people to get involved and vote, line dancing broke out.
That mix of politics and fun, mostly the latter, is what makes U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn’s annual fish fry in the state’s capital city so popular, attendees said.

“We all came out, and everybody’s enjoying themselves,” said Shantell Zimmerman, 58, of Columbia.
“It brings out the community,” agreed Dionne Brown, 55, of Irmo, who’s been attending the event for six years. “Then we actually get to discuss our views and takeaways.”
Hundreds of people attended the event that started in 1992, the year voters first elected Clyburn to the 6th Congressional District, as a thank you to the voters who couldn’t afford the Democratic Party’s high-dollar fundraisers.
Over time, the “World Famous Annual Fish Fry” — which includes free food and drinks — has become a must-attend event for Democrats seeking local, statewide and national office.
This year was no different, even if Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate — said they’re not running for the 2028 nomination.
“I know I’m not running,” Moore told reporters Friday. “But the thing I’m also very clear about is that anyone who’s talking about 2028 is not taking 2025 very seriously.”
Moore and Walz, as well as Clyburn and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison of Columbia, emphasized the importance of focusing on what’s happening now in Washington, D.C.
Proposed cuts to government safety nets like Medicaid and billionaire Elon Musk’s efforts to rapidly slash federal spending were among the topics the governors touched on Friday during speeches at the fish fry, as well as the Blue Palmetto Fundraising Dinner the same night.
“I taught school long enough to know it’s because they’re weak and they’re bullies, and when you stand up to them, they fade away,” said Walz, a former high school geography teacher.
While both declined that they’re running for president, there’s wide speculation otherwise. Their addresses at the events in South Carolina — which last year got promoted from holding the Democratic Party’s first-in-the-South to first-in-the-nation presidential primary — sounded a lot like campaign speeches.

Walz will also speak Saturday at the state Democratic Party’s annual convention.
Lucy Owens, an Anderson County delegate to the state convention, discounted the governors’ refusals, saying the 2028 presidential campaign has clearly begun.
“They’re all going to come through here. They’re the first ones,” she said.
In 2019, the fish fry drew more than 20 potential candidates hoping to appeal to South Carolina Democrats.
The following year, Joe Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary, a victory that ended up vaulting him to the presidency. South Carolina’s primary was elevated for 2024 as Biden’s thank you to the state.
With Biden gone, the Democratic party in flux, and Harrison no longer leading the national party, South Carolina maintaining its first-in-the-nation status is in question.
Clyburn’s comments Friday suggest he knows it won’t. He doesn’t care if the state is first, just that it’s early, he said.
“The most important hitter on a team is the cleanup hitter. He comes in fourth place,” Clyburn told reporters at his event.
“I’m not concerned about whether or not we’re first, second, third. Please, let us be at least four,” he said.
That would take South Carolina back to having the first primary in the South.
In the aftermath of Trump’s landslide victory and the Republican Party gaining control of both chambers of Congress, the Democratic Party is in a reset.
Walz and Moore, the first Black governor in Maryland’s history, are among the early faces of it.
Winning South Carolina, which changed the trajectory of Biden’s 2020 presidential run, will be crucial for Democratic hopefuls.
Owens, the Anderson County delegate, pointed to the stage where Walz and Moore spoke, saying every Democrat who wants to be president will eventually appear in that exact spot.
“They got to come through here. Not South Carolina. They got to go right there,” she said.
Both governors received raucous ovations from South Carolina Democrats, drawing cheers, standing ovations and even a few laughs as they took shots at the GOP.
Owens said “they’re both very great candidates,” and she’s “excited” to hear more from them over the coming years.
That was the general consensus from attendees who spoke with the SC Daily Gazette. However, they were significantly more familiar with Walz because of his time on the campaign trail last year with Vice President Harris.
“I know less about Wes Moore than I do about Tim Walz, but I think he’s a good speaker,” said Laura Lowery, a 69-year-old from Fountain Inn. “I think he’s done a good job in his state as well.”
Moore has recently come under fire for vetoing a bill that would establish a commission to examine state and federal policies from 1877 to 1965 and come up with recommendations for reparations.
South Carolina Rep. John King, D-Rock Hill, asked the state party to remove Moore as the keynote speaker of Friday’s Blue Palmetto Dinner. Party leaders never responded to questions about that request.
But for at least some attendees, the veto perturbed them too. “I didn’t understand why he would do that,” said Tony Winbush of Anderson.
But once Winbush, a 50-year-old Army veteran, heard Moore speak about his time in the Army, as well as his pardoning of 175,000 cannabis convictions, her opinion changed.
“I think when you don’t know the whole story and you just listen to sound bites, which is what we do a lot, we’ll make brash judgments about people, when we are really fighting the same fight,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5517-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-31 14:04:12.317876

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A strange turn of events followed the arrest of Ramón Morales Reyes, a 54-year-old Mexican-born man, who was living in Milwaukee as he sought a U-visa — a type of visa available to victims of crimes. 
On Friday, advocates from Voces de la Frontera joined immigration attorneys representing Morales Reyes to dispute accusations made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that Morales Reyes — who does not speak or write in English — drafted a neatly handwritten note in English threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump. Voces de la Frontera and Morales Reyes’ attorneys are calling for DHS to correct the record and clear his name.
The affair began on May 21, when Voces de la Frontera received a hotline call reporting a possible sighting of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Milwaukee. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, said during the Friday press conference that one of the group’s “trained community verifiers” contacted local residents who confirmed the sighting and also provided video footage of Morales Reyes being detained. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“His vehicle was left on the side of the road, and using the license plate we were able to identify the owner and communicate with his family,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “Shortly after, Ramón’s daughter came to our office to seek help. We assisted her in completing a power of attorney and ensuring that her father received the essential medication that was critical to his health. We immediately contacted attorney Kime Adbuli, who has been representing Ramón in his ongoing U-visa case.”
Neumann-Ortiz explained that a “U-visa” is a form of immigration relief for crime victims who have suffered emotional or physical abuse and who have helped law enforcement or government officials in the investigation and prosecution of a crime. “It provides a temporary legal status, and a pathway to permanent residency,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “In the past, the Morales Reyes family had sought resources from Voces.” 
Days after the arrest, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem provided statements for a press release describing Morales Reyes as an “illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump.” Noem added, “this threat comes not even a year after President Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania and less than two weeks after former FBI Director Comey called for the president’s assassination.” 
Noem was referring to Comey sharing a picture on Instagram of sea shells arranged into the numbers “8647”, which “86” interpreted as slang for “get rid of” and “47” being a reference to Trump, the 47th U.S. president, NPR reported. Comey is now being investigated by the Trump administration. “All politicians and members of the media should take notice of these repeated attempts on President Trump’s life and tone down their rhetoric,” Noem said. “I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of President Trump.”
The DHS press release included an image of the note, neatly handwritten in turquoise-colored pen and in flawless English. “We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans,” it began. “We have done more for this country than you white people — you have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump get what he has coming to him. I will self deport myself back to Mexico but not before I use my 30 yard 6 to shoot your precious president in is (sic) head — I will see him at one of his big ralleys (sic).” The reference to “30 yard 6” may be an incorrectly written reference to 30-6 (pronounced as “30 odd 6”), which is a high caliber bullet for rifles.

Morales Reyes’ family says that it is impossible that he wrote the note. Described by his attorneys as a soft spoken,  hardworking and committed family man, Morales Reyes works as a dishwasher. He was described as coming from a rural part of Mexico where it’s common for people to have no more than a third-grade education. Morales Reyes had difficulty filling out paperwork, does not speak English and is not proficient in writing in Spanish. Neumann-Ortiz said that his family called Voces organizers, confirming that Morales Reyes had very little formal education, and could not read or write in Spanish. 
Since his arrest, Morales Reyes’ family has received death threats on social media. “They want his name cleared,” said Neumann-Ortiz. On the day he was arrested, CNN reported, Morales Reyes was questioned by detectives from the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), who suspected that someone may have been setting him up to get deported. Police were reportedly investigating jailhouse calls from a person who’d allegedly assaulted Morales Reyes during a September 2023 armed robbery. 
CNN reported that ICE agents were given a handwritten note by Morales Reyes with family-related information, and agents realized that the handwriting did not match. The questions surrounding the letter are reminiscent of those stemming from the arrest and deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was accused by the U.S. government of being a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13. President Trump held up pictures which had been altered to appear as though “M S 1 3” was tattooed on Abrego Garcia’s knuckles.  
Getting Morales Reyes deported would prevent him from testifying against the person in custody for allegedly attacking him, his attorneys said at the press conference.

Attorney Kime Abduli said there are due process concerns around Morales Reyes’ arrest, as it could interrupt his testimony as a victim in a criminal proceeding and  also impact his U-visa case. The specific visa process which Morales Reyes is undertaking “is really meant to offer protection to people who may be undocumented who are victims of crime in the United States,” Abduli explained. 
“It’s meant to encourage them to report those crimes, when they are victims of those crimes, to the authorities, and to cooperate in the investigation. Where a person may be undocumented and fearful of reporting these sorts of things, Congress basically established the U-visa to make it ‘safe’ for them to come forward with that information. As long as they’re cooperating with law enforcement, the U-visa is intended to offer some protection for that individual.” Obtaining a U-visa can be a very lengthy process spanning seven to eight years at a minimum, Abduli said. 
Attorney Cane Oulahan, who is representing Morales Reyes in his deportation proceedings, said that ensuring due process is his top priority. Oulahan said that a bond hearing is expected in the coming days, where he expects the government to argue “vigorously” for Morales Reyes to be deported. It’s likely that the accusations from Noem’s DHS will also be raised before the judge. 
Another controversial deportation in Milwaukee
The controversy and questions come as ICE attempts to expel another Milwaukee resident. Yessenia Ruano, a teacher’s aide in Milwaukee Public Schools, was ordered recently by ICE to return to her home country of El Salvador in a matter of days. This is despite Ruano having a pending visa application for trafficking victims, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
On Friday, the same day Voces and attorneys held a press conference about the Morales Reyes case, ICE ordered Ruano to get on a deportation flight on June 3. Ruano will leave behind her 9-year-old twin daughters, who are U.S. citizens. Ruano’s attorneys said that it appears that ICE is abandoning policies of waiting for processing of T and U visas, which protect people from deportation. Ruano has lived in the U.S. for 14 years, has no criminal record, has a valid work visa, and is employed at a bilingual public elementary school. She said she is hoping that a final legal filing could pause her deportation.

Ruano’s case spurred a flurry of condemnation from local Milwaukee officials. “Deporting valued members of our community who are raising and educating our kids, assisting law enforcement in their important work, and giving back to our neighborhoods should alarm us all,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley wrote on X. “These individuals are victims of a broken immigration system. The Trump administration told the country they were only going after ‘the worst of the worst’. But time and time again, we see them targeting the very people who contribute the most — our neighbors, our coworkers, or friends.” 
Crowley said that he is “deeply alarmed that our country continues to turn its back on our most vulnerable.” He went on to say that “by not standing up and protecting our neighbors, we’re not just failing them — we’re failing our entire community. Due process is under attack, and that should concern all of us in Wisconsin and across the country.”
Congresswoman Gwen Moore also released a statement, calling Ruano a “beloved member of her community,” and declaring that “deporting Yessenia will not make our country safer.” Moore said the deportation order “will only separate Yessenia from her children and her community while exposing her to danger she was forced to flee in El Salvador. Instead of making America a beacon of hope for people like Yessenia, this Administration’s focus is only pushing cruelty that demonizes immigrants.”
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said that the Trump administration’s deportation of Ruano is “wrong and harmful.” Clancy said in a statement that Ruano had volunteered at her local Catholic parish, worked in her neighborhood school, and was taking care of her family.

Recent weeks have seen ICE and the Trump Administration focus more on Milwaukee. Since late March, at least four people have been arrested by immigration agents after attending regularly scheduled hearings at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Local officials denounced the courthouse arrests, only for Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan to also be arrested by federal agents for allegedly obstructing authorities by escorting a man sought by ICE from her courtroom into a public hallway.
“Yessenia is an asset to our community whenever she touches it,” said Clancy. “Our community and her daughters deserve to continue to have Yessenia with us here, and Yessenia deserves to continue to build a thriving life with her family in Milwaukee.” Clancy condemned ICE, saying the agency “continues to act arbitrarily and with cruelty. We must all do what we can to protect our neighbors from it.”

Some protesters in front of the Florida Capitol Friday evening had politics on their mind, while others told the Phoenix they were there because others, who had been detained or are scared to leave their homes, couldn’t be. 
ICE raids FSU College Town construction site, buses away workers

The protest drew hundreds of people, a day after Immigration and Customs Enforcement and state police raided a construction site in Tallahassee and detained many of the workers.
“There’s a lot of people who can’t be out here right now. A lot of them are scared to leave their house, so I gotta do it for them,” Luis Arreguin said.  
Arreguin moved to Tallahassee 10 years ago from Mayo, Florida, where people had more respect for laborers, he said. 
“Blindsided, corrupt,” Arreguin said of the raid. “They’re not doing it for right reasons but, whatever, it is what it is. All we can do is do this right here, what we’re doing. There’s a god up there, he sees it all, he knows what happened yesterday.”
Wearing a white button-up shirt, Arreguin sat quietly on a bollard in front of the Capitol, holding a sign reading, “IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE,” while others chanted, encouraged honking from drivers-by, and cheered for speakers.
“We’re not bad people,” Arreguin said, referring to “Mexicans, Hispanics, immigrants.” 
“This nation was built on immigrants. So, I don’t know what the hell happened in the last 10-20 years that we forgot,” Arreguin said. “Some of the greatest inventions that’s come out of this country have come from immigrants. It’s just the passing of the torch, man, you just gotta wait it out.”

According to ICE, “100+ illegal aliens” were arrested during the “targeted enforcement operation Thursday.” The agency said people arrested were from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, and Honduras “to name a few.”
The operation was directed by ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee and assisted by Florida Highway Patrol, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Internal Revenue Service, and Drug Enforcement Administration. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who called a special legislative session earlier this year to create laws cracking down on illegal immigration, characterized the raid as a “Major bust in Tallahassee!”
Ivette Martinez, a daughter of immigrants, traveled from Bainbridge, Georgia, to join the protest. 
“It’s inhumane,” said Martinez, whose husband works five minutes away from the construction site. “It could’ve been my husband.”
“My question is, we present a birth certificate, Social Security, a Real ID that we have, and they still be saying it’s fake,” Martinez said, concerned about cases such as one the Phoenix reported on in which a U.S. citizen was detained under the new immigration laws after showing his ID. 
“So what, me as a USA citizen, do I have to prove in order to prove that I am a USA citizen? If they don’t take my word, they don’t take my real ID, Social Security, or birth certificate, what else? Am I just supposed to let them detain me or fight back?”
After entering the construction site near the Florida State University campus, federal and state officials asked workers for identification and separated them into two categories, witnesses told the Phoenix. According to ICE, one worker during Thursday’s raid was charged with four counts of assault on law enforcement officers and another attempted to pull a weapon on officers.
Some were free to go; others were handcuffed and led onto white buses with metal-plated windows to be transported away from the worksite, escorted by the Highway Patrol. Officials, many masked, on the scene declined to provide information about the operation.
Construction workers who’d been allowed to leave told the Phoenix that law enforcement officers had surrounded the site on West Gaines Street in FSU-adjacent College Town before the raid began at about 9 a.m.

Kat Spiegel drove an hour and half from Jennings, Florida, with politics on her mind. 
“I’m here because Trump is dismantling our entire democracy. He’s trampling over the Constitution,” Spiegel told the Phoenix. “ICE is out of control and they’re running around, they’re not identifying themselves, we have no idea who they are, they’re masked, it’s disgusting, he needs to go.”
DeSantis posted to social media Friday that federal officials “are pursuing the subcontractor responsible for hiring the illegal alien workers…”
“These types of enforcement actions aim to eliminate illegal employment, holding employers accountable and protecting employment opportunities for America’s lawful workforce,” said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Tallahassee Assistant Special Agent in Charge Nicholas Ingegno in a news release. 
“HSI Tallahassee, working alongside our state, local, and federal partners, will continue protecting public safety by enforcing the immigration laws of our nation.”

‘Immigrants Make America Great’
Tony Alas, who works in construction, was at the protest with his family, holding a sign covered in stars and hearts that read, “Immigrants Make America Great.”
“They say we come here to steal. We’re not stealing anything. We’re just doing the job that nobody else wants to do,” Alas told the Phoenix.
“They say, ‘Come here, do it the right way.’ The immigration system is broken and they need to fix it,” Alas said. 
“Because sometimes it’s people with no papers and it’s not about money, it’s about your kin. Some of my friends, they had to go back. When you have a wife and kids, you don’t want to go back to your country and wait like, like, what? Three or four years, 10 years to get your papers straight? So you take the risk to stay with no papers.”
Tony Alas’ 19-year-old daughter Wendy, joined him.
“Me and my siblings, this country is all we’ve ever known. This country is where we grew up, we know everything here,” Wendy Alas said.
“It’s so heartbreaking, and I don’t know what I would do in a situation where my family or any of my other families like my aunts, my uncles, were sent back and I wouldn’t be able to see them again,” Wendy Alas said.

As the crowd formed and speakers aired concerns, protesters chanted, “One, two, three, four, immigrants are worth fighting for,” and, “Five, six, seven, eight, no more ICE in our state.”
“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE,” they chanted, accompanied by drums and megaphones.
Groups involved in the protest included Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, Leon County Democratic Environmental Caucus, Young Democratic Socialists of America, Students for a Democratic Society, Voices United Gadsden, Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and Food Not Bombs
Protesters held up signs reading things like, “Abolish ICE,” “Due process for all,” “Let people work,” “No 287(g),” and “Melt ICE.”
“When our communities are under attack, we stand up and fight back. Politicians won’t help us, the people in power don’t want to help us, so we have to show them that we won’t stand for it and the people will rise up,” Joelle Nunez, an organizer with Tallahassee Immigrant Rights Alliance, said through a loudspeaker. 
“If they’re focused on gang members and drug dealers, why are they focusing on arresting people that are simply trying to earn a living for their family?” Nunez told protesters. 
Nunez, an FSU senior in biology, said she would ask politicians to “stop facilitating these immigration raids.”
“Florida, of all the states in the whole United States, has the most 287(g) agreements; we have a Immigration Enforcement Council now and, all in all, we’re not only taking Trump’s immigration policies in hand, but actually like stepping them up on the local level, and I think that’s not right. What we need to be seeing is a sort of, some type of opposition to the immigration policies,” Nunez told the Phoenix.

The officers followed Wilson before pulling her over on Greenfield Street, allegedly for twice failing to properly use a turn signal. Wilson denied committing the traffic infractions, but informed officers she didn’t have a valid driver’s license.
What happened next as Wilson stood on the curb with police officers was closely examined by the Sedgwick County District Court, Kansas Court of Appeals and Kansas Supreme Court. In the end, Wilson lost her bid to exclude evidence of a drug offense and the state’s highest court exposed a disagreement regarding constitutional rights of individuals subjected to searches and seizures by law enforcement.
On Friday, the Supreme Court’s majority opinion from Justice Caleb Stegall affirmed the officers’ compliance with the Fourth Amendment in terms of constitutionally conducting the traffic stop and deploying Oden, a drug-sniffing dog, to examine the exterior of Wilson’s vehicle. Wilson had refused to consent to a search of her vehicle. However, the canine alerted to presence of illicit drugs. A subsequent examination of the car’s interior by Wichita officers led to discovery of a packet of oxycodone pills.
Stegall concluded that because Wilson had no legal ability to drive the car away at conclusion of the traffic-related portion of the stop, officers didn’t overstep their authority by nominally extending the encounter to allow for the dog sniff. Four minutes elapsed between when the officers completed her traffic citation and the time Oden alerted to presence of drugs.
“Even though she was not under arrest, Wilson argues that because she was not free to leave during these four minutes, she was unconstitutionally seized as an extension of the traffic stop,” Stegall said in the opinion. “As such, she concludes that the search of the car was also unconstitutional and therefore the evidence gained from the unconstitutional search must be excluded.”
Stegall’s majority opinion argued Wilson’s suspended license created an unusual circumstance enabling officers to deploy the K-9 around her legally parked car that no one was attempting to move.
“Oden’s alert provided probable cause, which allowed the officers to perform a warrantless search of the car … and the pills were properly admitted into evidence,” Stegall’s opinion said. “Therefore, officers do not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment’s protections by performing a dog sniff of any vehicle that is legally parked in public.”
The dissent by Justice Eric Rosen, which was joined by Chief Justice Marla Luckert and Justice Melissa Standridge, said the drug evidence should have been suppressed because prolonging a traffic stop to complete the drug sniff without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.
Rosen held the Wichita officers seized Wilson and the vehicle, extended the traffic stop, deployed Oden and discovered an envelope containing 30 oxycodone capsules in the car’s console.
Rosen expressed frustration the majority opinion “pronounces some new legal rules for which it provides no supporting authority.” He challenged the majority’s declaration that a vehicle directed to the side of the road during a traffic stop shouldn’t be characterized as seized by law enforcement.
“The majority likens this car to any car that was voluntarily parked in a public place,” Rosen wrote. “From here, the majority announces that officers can perform a dog sniff on any car legally parked in public.”
In 2022, Wilson was convicted of driving while suspended and illegal possession of opiates.
She unsuccessfully argued in district court for suppression of drug evidence while alleging the officers impermissibly extended scope of the traffic stop to create a window for deployment of the K-9 unit.
The Court of Appeals sided with the district court in 2023 after concluding there was “no evidence that the dog sniff meaningfully extended the duration of the original stop.” The divided Supreme Court affirmed Wilson’s constitutional rights weren’t violated.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kansas-Supreme-Court-members.png,,,2025-05-31 09:59:47.240990

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
 

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 
  Balanced markets 

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
  Help for teachers 

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed.The Nevada Assembly on Friday night approved what will likely be the state’s largest ever public subsidy: $1.4 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to support a movie studio in Las Vegas.
Assembly Bill 238 passed the Assembly by a razor-thin margin: 22 in support, 20 opposed. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration in the waning days of the legislative session.
The bill would massively expand Nevada’s film tax credit program to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film studio currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project (after the Las Vegas neighborhood where it would be located). Hollywood giants Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery are attached to the project. Howard Hughes Holdings is developing.




How transferable tax credits cost the state money: A $50 million example
Transferable tax credits sell for less than face value — a discount of about 10% isn’t unusual.
Let’s say the state issues Sony $50 million of tax credits. MGM Resorts International buys them from Sony for $45 million. Then, instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes that it owes, MGM gives the state the tax credits it bought from Sony.
MGM gets a $5 million tax break.
Sony gets $45 million.
And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.
— Hugh Jackson




Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year. AB 238 would raise that cap to $120 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. The majority of those tax credits, $95 million per year, would be reserved for productions at the Summerlin studio; $25 million per year would be for productions not attached to the studio.
Altogether, that’s equivalent to $1.8 billion in public subsidies for the television and film industry. If approved by the Senate and signed into law by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, the legislation will be the largest public subsidy approved by the State of Nevada, surpassing the $1.25 billion approved by lawmakers in 2014 for Tesla Motors.
Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Danielle Monroe Moreno, who sponsored the bill, have pushed back on the characterization of their proposal as a public subsidy for massive corporations, instead framing it as an investment in a new industry that will bring thousands of new jobs and new revenue to the state.
While tax credits aren’t issued to companies until they prove they’ve met the qualifications for them, the state must treat them as “negative revenue” when forecasting expected state revenue. That means they do impact the state budgeting process.
Opponents have argued that the return on investment is low. An independent analysis commissioned by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which houses the Nevada Film Office, determined that AB238 would stimulate the state economy but not enough to offset the massive expansion of the film tax credit program.
An analysis commissioned by the backers of AB 238 offered a rosier projection, but even that acknowledged that most of the projected economic activity is indirect or induced.
An amendment adopted by the Assembly will create a special tax zone around the Summerlin film studio that captures some of the local taxes generated and diverts it to the Clark County School District to fund pre-k programs in East Last Vegas. Additional guardrails were also amended into the bill.
Support in the Assembly did not fall across party lines. Among the 27 Democrats in the chamber, 15 voted in support and 12 voted against. Among Republicans, seven supported and eight opposed.
The Summerlin studio bill received less support in the Assembly than the bill two years ago that approved $380 million in public assistance for a proposed baseball stadium for the Oakland A’s on the Las Vegas Strip. That bill passed the Assembly 25-15. (Two lawmakers were excused from that vote.)
Banking bill vote raises eyebrows
The razor-thin film tax credit bill vote was not the only dramatic moment in the Assembly Friday. Earlier in the floor session, Assembly Bill 500 fell short of the required two-thirds approval it needed to pass the chamber. The bill would have allowed for payment banks, a new type of financial institution that focuses solely on payment processing rather than lending.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, who sponsored that bill, believes the bill will create competition in the financial services industry and lower costs for businesses by cutting out financial middlemen.
The Assembly vote was 25-17, a simple majority but three short of the two-thirds it needed because it would raise state revenue. Six Democrats and 11 Republicans opposed the bill. Four Republicans and 11 Democrats supported the bill.
Immediately after the bill failed, a motion was made to reconsider the vote and move the bill to the chief clerk’s desk.
Yeager said afterward he wasn’t surprised by the outcome, adding that he wasn’t sure he had the votes it needed but decided “to put it out there and see.” 
He dismissed the notion that some Democrats may have withdrawn support after learning that the Nevada Firearms Coalition PAC was privately urging Republicans to support the bill, something Yeager and others in his caucus apparently did not know until it was reported by The Nevada Independent days earlier.
Yeager chalked up the vote to lawmakers being hesitant about complex financial banking legislation. He added that he plans on having “a few more conversations” about the bill on Saturday to see if another vote is possible.
Because of procedural rules, AB500 needs to pass the full Assembly on Saturday in order to have a chance at making it to the governor’s desk.

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.












We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s largest hunger-relief organization says it faces a $2.5 million budget shortfall next year because of President Donald Trump’s federal funding cuts.
Feeding South Dakota CEO Lori Dykstra addressed lawmakers on a budget committee Friday in Pierre. She said the group has already cut the amount of food it provides and has merged distribution sites. She warned that unless the funding gap is filled, 21 food distribution events in 15 counties will be eliminated, affecting 3,400 families and eliminating more than 1.7 million meals annually.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

“We’re not here to say whether or not the federal funding decisions are right or wrong,” Dykstra said. “We’re just letting you know that one of the unintentional consequences is that the food safety net for Feeding South Dakota and for all of your neighbors facing hunger is at risk.”
The cuts come from the rollback of federal aid by the Trump administration, particularly programs begun during the COVID-19 pandemic to help the U.S. Department of Agriculture support food distribution. 
Dykstra said the group must now find $2.5 million to replace lost USDA support in fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, or make cuts. 
Dykstra also warned that if the current budget reconciliation legislation in Congress is enacted, the state could be on the hook for 5% of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits and a larger share of SNAP administrative costs, adding up to a possible $13 million total state obligation. SNAP participants can use their benefits to purchase food.
“SNAP benefits get people out of food lines,” she said. “So, it’s either they’re in the food bank line or they’re in the grocery store.” 
Dykstra said 113,000 South Dakotans are food insecure, meaning they are uncertain about where their next meal will come from, often forced to skip meals, eat less, or purchase cheaper, less nutritious food.

The Tulsa race massacre began after a white mob gathered at a jail where a Black teen had been arrested on false charges of “attacking” a white girl in an elevator. 
In reality, he may have tripped or bumped into her. Although authorities exonerated him, that didn’t stop the mob. 
“As the whites moved north, they set fire to practically every building in the African American community, including a dozen churches, five hotels, 31 restaurants, four drug stores, eight doctor’s offices, more than two dozen grocery stores, and the Black public library,” according to a 2001 report on the massacre. 
That rampage left as many as 300 dead and 10,000 homeless. “They tried to kill all the Black folks they could see,” recalled George Monroe, who was 5 at the time. The Black community known as Greenwood bore the name of the Mississippi Delta town. Greenwood, known as the “Black Wall Street” for its bustling businesses, became a pile of ashes. 
No one was ever prosecuted for these crimes. Viola Fletcher, a 107-year-old who survived, said, “I have lived through the massacre every day. Our country may forget this history, but I cannot. I will not. And other survivors do not. And our descendants do not.”

The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.


Federal Fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference. Read the latest.


	An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country that are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.
Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May 2018.
Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 are more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases.
In its response to questions from the Arizona Mirror, an unnamed “senior DHS official” said that the department would not confirm whether the plane had been used for deportation flights.
“ICE uses sub-contractors to help carry out its mission to deport illegal aliens,” the unnamed official said in an email. “These sub-contractors are not exclusive to ICE. For operational security, we will not confirm tail numbers of planes used for removing illegal aliens who are often violent criminals and foreign terrorists.”
Claims that most of the Trump administration’s deportees are violent criminals have been repeatedly proven false.
Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history before it became part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
 From ferrying travelers to deportees

The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
 ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona

ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft that had been used for deportations had been used by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action against the United States, passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac and some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs, and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data are available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the [second] Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, pictured on the South Carolina Statehouse grounds on Sept. 18, 2024 (File/Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — After five sessions in the state House, Rep. Jermaine Johnson might make a bid for the Governor’s Mansion.
The Columbia Democrat announced Saturday he’s forming a committee to assess support and engage with voters statewide, which is considered a step toward launching an official run.
“From expanding economic opportunity and improving education to advocating for criminal justice reform and protecting working families, I’ve stood side-by-side with South Carolinians through every challenge,” Johnson said in a press release. “Now, I’m exploring what it would mean to take that work to the Governor’s Office to serve all of the people of South Carolina.”
The father of four — who turns 40 on July 4 — did not offer a timeline on his decision. Filing for the June 2026 primaries isn’t until mid-March.
Johnson is the first Democrat to announce interest in seeking the job as the state’s CEO.
He recognizes it would be an uphill battle for any Democrat in South Carolina.
No Democrat has won the office since Jim Hodges in 1998. The last Democrat to win any statewide office was Jim Rex in 2006, when he became state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
“South Carolina is at a crossroads,” Johnson said. “We need leadership that listens, leads with integrity, and puts people before politics.”
No Republican has officially announced a bid for governor, but six have said they’re considering it: Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, Attorney General Alan Wilson; U.S. House Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman; and state Sens. Josh Kimbrell and Sean Bennett.
The race is wide open since Gov. Henry McMaster can’t seek another term. He’s already the longest-serving elected governor in state history, since he ascended to the job in January 2017 — when Nikki Haley became President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador — giving him two years in office before his first inauguration.
Regardless of whether Johnson decides to make a gubernatorial run, he said he “wholeheartedly plans” to still run for re-election to the state House seat representing parts of Richland and Kershaw counties.
South Carolina law allows candidates to seek more than one office at the same time. They just can’t hold multiple offices simultaneously. If they win more than one in an election, they have to make a choice.
Johnson first won a seat in the Statehouse in 2020, when he ousted 22-year veteran Rep. Jimmy Bales in the Democratic primary. Two years later, the elections gave Republicans a supermajority in the chamber. The 2024 elections gave the GOP a supermajority in the Senate too.
That doesn’t stop Johnson from making sure his colleagues know where he stands. And even if Republicans have no intention of supporting his argument, they listen.
“For years, I’ve worked to uplift our communities — not just with words, but with action,” Johnson said in the release.
During the chamber’s May 7 debate on the roughly $14.5 billion state budget, he put up 37 amendments to protest a decision by the chambers’ chief budget writers not to fund any local projects, known as earmarks, this year. All failed, but he ensured his colleagues knew more about some of the projects they were dismissing.
Three weeks later, as the House voted on the final budget deal, Rep. Joe White brought up Johnson’s fight while scolding his GOP colleagues. The Newberry County Republican noted he voted for Johnson’s first amendment.
“He put up some good amendments, and what did we do?” said White, a member of the uber-conservative Freedom Caucus. “We ran roughshod over every one of them.”
His comments also show that Johnson’s well-liked across the political spectrum.
“I love Jermaine,” White said.
Johnson, born in Los Angeles, has a compelling life story, which became the subject of a documentary titled “I Got Myself a Yard,” released last fall.
Homeless in his teens, Johnson earned a basketball scholarship to the College of Charleston.
His 1,276 points still rank 21st in program history and led to a spot in a developmental league for NBA prospects before stints playing professionally in Canada, Portugal, Mexico and Brazil.
After his basketball career, he returned to South Carolina, starting New Economic Beginnings Foundation, a nonprofit aimed to aid troubled children and military veterans.
In 2018, he founded Dream Team Consulting firm, and he’s an adjunct professor at Midlands Technical College.
Ahead of his own run for the Statehouse, Johnson was the state campaign chair for Andrew Yang’s 2020 bid for president, which ended ahead of the South Carolina primary.

The Sleeping Bear Dunes have been active systems for millennia, shifting with the weather or fixed by vegetation. But changes can seem sudden, especially when measured against human infrastructure.
That was the case with a popular wooden viewing platform at the Lake Michigan Overlook’s stop #9 along Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive in Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.
The platform rested on the dune some 450 feet above the lake. When National Park Service staff arrived at the site this spring, they found some of its pilings were no longer touching the ground. Winter storms, wind and rain had eroded the sand underneath.
“The western portion of that overlook was freestanding. It was free-hanging. The sand had moved on,” said Scott Tucker, superintendent of Sleeping Bear Dunes.
Tucker estimated roughly half a million people visited the stop every year. Some would venture out onto the platform.
Now, it’s gone.
Staff dismantled it earlier this month because it wasn’t safe.

Why do the dunes do that? As the glaciers retreated at the end of the Ice Age, they shaped this area’s geography. Wind and water have changed the lakeshore and the dunes along it for millennia. But human-caused climate change is also influencing erosion in the Great Lakes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, warming temperatures contribute to lower ice cover and water levels, which in turn can make coastlines vulnerable to erosion and flooding.

 Underneath the park’s Facebook post announcing the news, people reacted with stories and memories of past visits, from engagements to shared moments with loved ones who have passed away.
The platform was installed in 1986, further back from the edge of the dune and firmly anchored in the ground.
But in the nearly four decades since, the dune has retreated. Tucker said in a given year, the dune face moves about 1 to 3 feet east, away from the lake.
These dunes move with the prevailing winds. In this case, the sand is being blown from the overlook and deposited across the Sleeping Bear Plateau, said Tom Ulrich, a former deputy superintendent of the park who retired about a year and a half ago.
“The dunes are inexorable,” Ulrich said. “They will move, and you cannot stop them from moving, and you’re foolish if you think you can.”
It’s been a chaotic time for national parks. The Trump administration froze federal hiring earlier this year before lifting it for the National Park Service in March. Many federal employees have lost their jobs, left, or been caught in a state of limbo since January. And the proposed federal budget, which narrowly passed the House, would mean major cuts to the agency.
Sleeping Bear Dunes has around two-thirds of the staff typically there this time of year, according to the Glen Arbor Sun and WLUC-TV.
Tucker, the superintendent, didn’t elaborate. “It’s a very complex system right now, and I’m really focused on opening up the lakeshore for the summer,” he said.
As for the future of the overlook, he said, in 2028 the park will look at planning and design for that location as part of a five-year recreation fee plan.
The Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive was the last area of the park to open for the season. And while the platform is gone, people can still visit the stop along the drive and take in the vast landscape.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan) Last week, by a single vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.” 
This is sweeping reconciliation bill that promises to reshape the American social safety net. At the heart of this legislation are more than $700 billion in cuts to Medicaid, a program that serves as a lifeline for tens of thousands of Montanans with disabilities. 
Medicaid pays for some of the most basic services many people with disabilities need to get by each day, like the basic personal care supports someone with a physical disability may need to get out of bed in the morning, the more intensive skill training and safety supervision someone with an intellectual disability may need to learn to live more independently, and it pays for medication to maintain a person’s mental health and more intensive community supports when they have mental health emergency. For Montanans with disabilities, this bill is not just a policy shift – it’s a direct threat to our lives.
The bill imposes new administrative hurdles, including requiring Medicaid recipients to reverify their eligibility twice a year. For people with disabilities – many of whom already navigate complex bureaucracies – this change increases the risk of losing coverage due to paperwork errors or missed deadlines. Here in Montana, we know this isn’t a mere possibility, it was our reality. In 2023 and 2024, Montana required Medicaid recipients to submit paperwork to verify their continued eligibility.  When Montanans tried to follow the rules to verify their eligibility, they found the state’s phone lines were left unanswered and many people were kicked off for administrative reasons without ever looking at their clinical need.  
Though the bill includes exemptions, these are often poorly implemented. In practice, people are misclassified, denied exemptions, or fall through the cracks due to inaccessible systems. People with legitimate disabilities are stripped of their health care and there is a big administrative burden on the individual and the state eligibility system to sort through wrongful denials and terminations. When Arkansas implemented work requirements in 2018 similar to the work requirements in the new federal reconciliation bill, more than 18,000 people lost coverage, many of them wrongfully, and there was no meaningful impact on employment.
At Disability Rights Montana, we have been here for 50 years serving the disability community and we hear from people every day who rely on Medicaid to live independently, to work, to go to school, and to participate in their communities. These are veterans with PTSD, children with autism, adults with spinal cord injuries, and seniors with dementia. Defunding disability services is a major step backwards in history to a time when people with disabilities were excluded from society and warehoused in poor institutional conditions. This bill sends a clear message to people with disabilities that their lives are not as valuable as tax cuts for the rich. 
Even if you don’t have a disability or don’t use Medicaid, you will feel the cuts. It is well known in health care circles that even Montanans who don’t rely on Medicaid for their insurance coverage will feel the effects of this bill, especially in rural communities. For example, this year the state legislature heard from hospital administrators and healthcare providers who explained the impact Medicaid expansion has had on our state. It has allowed rural hospitals to add or expand specialty services like orthopedic surgery and mental health care. Without this funding, these services may disappear and that will affect all patients, not just those who are covered by Medicaid. Hospitals and other health care providers serve the rich and poor alike. When the money for poor people goes away, so do the therapists, nurses, and doctors that money paid for. If you lose funding to cover portions of health care professionals’ salaries, those positions go away completely because you can’t hire 60% of a doctor in a rural hospital.

This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers. In 2020, Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order establishing eight weeks of guaranteed paid leave for eligible employees of Idaho’s executive branch agencies following the birth or adoption of a child. In 2024, Little signed an executive order to provide eight weeks of parental leave to state employees who foster a child.

The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.












We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver




Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
 Keeping talent in the workforce

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.

 GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
 Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
 Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

The old Kitty Clover building, as locals know it, has undergone a multimillion dollar renovation on its 3.5-acre site south of downtown. And a chunk of the 85,000-square-foot facility has been transformed into a co-working hub for artists.
Instead of 16,000 bags of chips daily, the building built in 1952 and rebranded as “Clover24” — a nod to its history and the main corridor on which it sits — is, at least for now, producing original thread paintings, pottery and other crafty products. 
 Boings, bowls, little people

Among the first 18 creative tenants is Diane Mattern, who kiddingly calls herself a “weird welder” whose work is seen regionally in the form of spiraled steel “boings” and other distinct concrete garden and indoor sculptures.
There’s Letha Goldsmith, an art therapist who uses magazine pages and glue to sculpt colorful bowls and containers and also incorporates figures of little people into various other art pieces.

Studio mate Amy Robertson’s creative bent is fiber art and thread painting, while neighbor comedian Todd Graves describes his multidisciplinary art forms as “unapologetically offbeat.”
They’re open for business in a structure that, for the first time in decades, offers a public-facing side. For example, a three-day open house and free inaugural group exhibition showing work of more than 90 local artists, including Therman Statom and Watie White, wraps up at 7 p.m. Saturday, May 31. 
Featured is Bart Vargas, whose art has been shown worldwide. His pieces will remain on display through July, along with work of other resident artists. 
Bob and Ilaamen Pelshaw, a husband-and-wife team that started and manages the artist co-working project, said they plan to host future events, in addition to opening doors daily for customers.
“We’re building community,” he said. “We want to celebrate the artists that live in the Omaha area.”
Ilaamen, herself an artist and illustrator with a studio at Clover24, said word quickly traveled, and the initial wave of available studios filled. 
“It shows demand,” she said.
 NE pandemic recovery funds 

The couple’s effort to offer a South Omaha spot where startups could create and show wares has had ups and downs. Their grand vision proposal was among 367 North and South Omaha applications vying a few years ago for a state grant from federal pandemic-related funds. The Nebraska Legislature earmarked and state officials awarded about $235 million for economic development projects for the areas disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.

State officials ultimately awarded the Pelshaw Group $50,000, much less than the $10 million requested. Those dollars have been directed toward a narrower slice of the plan, a job-preparedness program for Nebraskans transitioning from incarceration. 
The couple eventually turned to a different building site and a downsized plan, working now with Heinson Enterprises, which has owned the old Kitty Clover structure since the 1990s. A spokesman for the family-owned enterprise said it saw potentially new and greater use amid the growth of business, residential and recreational activity in and around the downtown of Nebraska’s largest city.
Artists who are situated mostly on the main level — in former administrative office suites turned studios that cover about 11% of the building — have signed leases that give them or the owner the right to terminate at any time, offering flexibility for both sides. 
“We’re in startup mode, testing the market to determine what is the highest and best use for the facility,” said spokesman Kyle Fowler. “They’re testing us out. We’re testing them out.”

Brokers Seth Campbell and Conner Dana of Campbell Dana Commercial Real Estate continue to seek one or more industrial users for the expansive lower level, and possibly a section of the main floor.
So far, the owners have invested roughly $4 million in a new roof, modern facade and building infrastructure. Depending on future uses, Fowler said, more renovations could be ahead.
The Pelshaws hope to add even more creative tenants, including a barber and a tattoo artist, and say the parking lot is an alluring amenity. They envision an outdoor sculpture garden starting with an uncommissioned J. Doe that will be adorned with historical mementos honoring the site’s previous chapters. 
 Slanted wall, industrial vibe 

While Ilaamen’s career launched in her homeland of Guatemala, it has advanced in Nebraska and during a three-year stint at long established Hot Shops Art Center in Omaha’s north downtown. Tenants consider Clover24 to be a mini version of Hot Shops, where artists feed off each other’s energy and often work collaboratively.

For Bob Pelshaw, who grew up in South Omaha, he hoped to provide a supportive and financially accessible space for area entrepreneurs. He recalls as a kid going outside and soaking in the smell of potato chips being made.
Both he and his wife said they appreciate the industrial vibe and unique spots throughout Clover24 that offer ways to be creative.
One of the studios has a slanted wall, interesting for hanging art. Another has curves for corners. There’s the “chip fryer gallery,” the “brick gallery” and an eclectic bathroom Ilaamen decorated with mashup portraits combining traits of art greats Andy Warhol and Bob Ross.
Said Ilaamen: “We want love in every corner, fun places everywhere you go.”

(Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Imagine you’re a veteran in Wheat Ridge, or a single mom in Lamar living with chronic pain. You’ve finally found something that works: a legal, plant-based supplement that helps you stay off opioids. But then, just as things start to stabilize, the state passes a law that could complicate how you access it.
That’s what just happened to thousands of Coloradans. On Thursday, Gov. Jared Polis signed Senate Bill 25-72 into law. We appreciate his commitment to public safety and consumer protection. But this law makes things more confusing, not safer. For the people who rely on kratom-derived products to manage pain or recover from addiction, it’s a major step backward.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I’ve worked in public policy for over 20 years, and I represent the Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust (HART), a nonprofit advocating for science-based kratom regulation (to be clear, we don’t sell or profit from these products). We’ve been trying to get rules in place that protect consumers and reflect real-world use for years. This bill doesn’t get us closer to that goal.
Kratom is a plant-based supplement long used in Southeast Asia and now increasingly used here in Colorado. One of its natural compounds, 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH, is found in products that patients say have helped them avoid returning to painkillers or heroin. Especially in rural and low-income areas, where access to traditional treatment can be limited, these products can mean the difference between stability and relapse.
In 2022, Colorado’s own state feasibility study laid out a clear, science-backed path for regulating these products. It advocated setting dosage limits, requiring testing and labeling, and establishing strong oversight. But SB-72 doesn’t follow that roadmap. It was rushed through in the final days of the legislative session and now leaves Colorado with a fragmented and unclear system. Safe products could be sidelined while dangerous ones remain on shelves.
Consider the facts:

Claim: The bill bans unsafe high-potency products.
Reality: It doesn’t. The most dangerous products — high-mitragynine shots and kratom/kava blends — are still on shelves. Meanwhile, safer products made by responsible companies are pushed out.
Claim: It regulates 7-OH.
Reality: The law sets a 2% cap on 7-OH but excludes anything above that threshold from regulation altogether. That leaves patients, businesses, and law enforcement in regulatory limbo.
Claim: It adds safety and labeling rules.
Reality: The bill makes only minor changes for kratom and none for 7-OH, even though that’s often the compound patients rely on most.

There’s also been public discussion tying this bill to the tragic death of Daniel Bregger. We deeply respect his family and their advocacy. But the facts matter: At the time, 7-OH products were not commercially available. Using that tragedy to justify this law distracts from the real dangers SB-72 fails to address.
The law now excludes many 7-OH products from the definition of a “kratom product,” but offers no clarity on how they should be regulated. 7-OH remains legal in Colorado, but SB-72 creates confusion instead of guidance. That helps bad actors more than consumers. Retailers don’t know what they can sell, patients don’t know what they can trust, and law enforcement doesn’t know what to enforce.
We want regulation. In fact, the brands we work with already follow many of the rules this bill should have required, such as limiting dosage based on science, testing products, and labeling ingredients. These are basic protections. But SB-72 doesn’t ensure they’re followed by everyone. It’s a major missed opportunity.
Colorado has built a national reputation for bold, evidence-based leadership on cannabis, psychedelics, and public health. SB-72 doesn’t live up to that legacy.
But it’s not too late.
Let’s come back to the table, this time with patients in the room. We can still build a framework that’s clear, fair and focused on safety. Colorado can still lead. We just have to choose to.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Each day now in Lawrence, where my family and I live, I watch the clouds roll in and the rains come.
The spring storm season thunders and flashes and pours, and the lawns flourish and gutters overflow. I sit here in my home office through the evenings and watch as the lightning casts strange shadows. I hear the rain pelting the roof. Later on, when I take our dog out for a walk, the rains have usually slowed and the neighborhood smells earthy and damp, while the doused roads shine under streetlamps.
During these days, my son hangs around the house. School has ended, and summer activities remain a few weeks distant. He plays video games and dotes on the pets. My husband’s work has shifted into its busiest season, so some days I only see him toward the end of the day.
I seem to live now, for a week or two at least, in a small protected bubble. The rains come and the world rumbles and my son and I stay indoors and wait for the storm to pass. Aren’t many of us doing that right now, staying in those kind of bubbles, waiting for the skies to clear? We can create those bubbles in different ways. Some of us watch seasons of old situation comedies, following the adventures of Sam and Diane and Cliff and Norm on Cheers (rest in peace, George Wendt). Some of us watch horror movies (I enjoyed Nicholas Roeg’s “Don’t Look Now” the other night). Some of us find escape through exercise or alcohol or other activities that change our brain and body chemistry.
It is the season of survival.
We endure the weather. It’s different for all of us. Here in Kansas, the weather might be a private prison company pressing to reopen facilities to serve Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. It might be a law that denies critical yet misunderstood health care to teenagers. It might be your immigration status if you study at a university. It might be an uncertain economic climate that threatens small business in towns and cities.
In uncertain times, we search for comparisons. We judge today’s storm against the storms of the past. We survived those, we tell ourselves, so surely we must survive these ones. Those storms may have even been worse, we tell ourselves. We should expect spring rains, Discover Magazine explains, as humid summer air collides with dry winter air. The mixture forms clouds, yields precipitation.
We still wait indoors, swaddled in decades-old quilts and drinking hot tea.
The metaphor strains. My correspondents will write me email messages insisting that determined Kansans can weatherproof their homes. We can work together to find community and purpose during these dreary, overcast days. We need not — must not — hide from the work ahead of us.
I understand these things, agree with them, have written them before. We can both endure and act. The stormy season will pass. These times will end. The clouds will clear and the sun will nudge itself above the horizon, and we will pick up the pieces. I will mow the lawn and pick up the random branches that fell from the giant tree in our front yard. Cleanup awaits, and it will take the whole subdivision pitching in.
Yet while spring storm season continues, at least let me have these gloomy evenings. Let me embrace poetry and fiction and imagination leaps. Grant me the time to recharge, to dote on my family, to enjoy distractions for a handful of days. We all deserve time to center ourselves, to feel protected from the inevitable deluge.
These moments of grace will steel us for a long, hot summer.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Democrats are calling for clarity in the state’s abortion law as the case of Adriana Smith continues to grab headlines worldwide.
Undiagnosed blood clots in Smith’s brain left the 30-year-old nurse brain dead months ago, but doctors have kept her organs functioning through medical devices. Family members told media outlets Smith’s body was being kept alive despite no chance for her to recover because she is pregnant and removing her from life support could violate the state’s ban on most abortions after six weeks.
Georgia’s top lawyer disagrees with that interpretation of the law.
  Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr speaks at the Georgia Chamber of Commerce’s Eggs and Issues event in Atlanta early in the 2025 legislative session. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.’”
But a public statement does not come with the force of law, said Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, and when it comes to the practice of medicine, legal gray areas can lead to tragic outcomes.
Speaking at a press conference Thursday at the state Capitol, Islam Parkes called on Carr to issue a legally binding opinion to answer a series of questions she said would spell out when doctors could treat a pregnant woman in a way that could harm or kill the fetus: Is a hospital legally required to maintain a brain dead pregnant woman on life support? What precisely constitutes a medical emergency under the law? Under what conditions does a pregnancy meet the threshold of incompatibility with life? How does the law affect legal standing of advanced directives and end-of-life planning for pregnant Georgians?
“These questions are not theoretical,” Islam Parkes said. “They’re urgent, because as long as this law remains vague, we will continue to see families traumatized, providers criminalized and patients left behind. Doctors are being forced to make impossible choices, families are trapped in grief and fear and women are dying.”
Islam Parkes was referencing two high-profile deaths, Georgians Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who both died in 2022 after suffering complications from taking abortion pills. Thurman died in a hospital after doctors waited nearly a day to perform a routine procedure to remove fetal tissue from her uterus; Miller died after family members said she was afraid to seek medical care because of the recently enacted law.
Democrats said there are likely more cases that do not end in death.
  Kaycee Maruscak said the pain of experiencing a miscarriage was exacerbated when she could not receive treatment for more than a week because doctors were skittish of potentially violating the state abortion law. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
of Gwinnett said she had already picked out a name for her unborn daughter, Sawyer Nicole Christian, but in March, a day after Maruscak held a gender reveal party, she discovered her daughter’s heart had stopped beating.
“In a matter of seconds, we went from preparing to welcome her into our lives to trying to figure out how to say goodbye,” she said at the Capitol press conference. “My doctor was sympathetic, but because of the restrictive abortion laws, my care was limited to a list of abortion clinics. No follow-up plan, no guidance and no support. Over the next two days, I called clinic after clinic, continuously having to repeat and relive that Sawyer did not have a heartbeat. My insurance recommended me to go to the emergency department because of increasing septic symptoms, so I did. I spent seven hours there in pain, in grief, and in shock, only to be discharged with no treatment, no resolution and no care.”
Maruscak said she spent more than a week carrying her daughter’s remains.
“What happened to me is not rare. It is not an outlier. It’s happening every day,” she said. “One in four women experience a miscarriage. Over half of them need medical intervention to complete it safely. This is not just a political issue, it’s a medical one.”
Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones made no bones about the party’s ultimate goal of repealing the six-week abortion ban, which went into effect in 2022 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion and left the matter to states.
“As that fight continues, we must stand with and demand clarification from our governor and attorney general,” Jones said. “What rights do women have under this law? Georgians have been asking this question. We as legislators have been asking this question and the people standing here today have been asking this question, yet Georgia’s leadership has stayed silent.”
  Sen. Ed Setzler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The author of Georgia’s abortion bill, Acworth Republican Sen. Ed Setzler, accused Democrats of playing politics in an attempt to drum up headlines.
“My heart goes out to Adriana, her family, and the young son inside of her who is struggling for his life,” Setzler said. “Nabilah Islam Parkes and the Democrats are sickening at the depths they will go to drag Adriana’s hurting family, who is trying to save the life of their grandson, through a sick political debate about expanding abortion.”
“The Democrats are making attacks as loudly as they can to try to seize media attention,” he added.
Conservative radio host and Georgia Life Alliance board member Martha Zoller said tragic cases like Maruscak’s are not the result of the state’s abortion ban – sometimes referred to by supporters as the “heartbeat bill” – but of hospitals misunderstanding or misapplying it.
“Once you’ve had a miscarriage or you’re in the process of a miscarriage, there is no heartbeat, so there should be no reason for care to be withheld or anything like that,” she said. “That’s the over-legalization of the medical care business with not allowing providers to be providers and to do what’s best for patients. And that has nothing to do with the heartbeat bill. That has to do with the structure at the hospital. The care for a miscarriage is not denoted as something that’s a method of abortion in the heartbeat bill, and once you’ve had a miscarriage, there is no heartbeat, so the heartbeat bill doesn’t come into play.”
“It’s a travesty that the Democratic caucus continues to mislead women and scare them for their own political purposes,” she added.

And chromite will be the official state mineral, a fact you can toast with the new official state cocktail, the orange crush.
Those are the most notable of just over 100 new laws that take effect on June 1, many of them duplicates. They range from local alcohol and bond bills to a severe retrenchment of a 2023 law on damages for victims of child sexual abuse that could have left the state open to billions in legal expenses.
It’s the first batch from the 849 bills from the 2025 General Assembly that have been signed into law, most of which will take effect on July 1 or Oct. 1.
But this first batch included some significant legislation, the most high-profile of which may have been House Bill 1378 which overhauls the Child Victims Act that passed to great fanfare just two years ago.
Racing to the courthouse to beat new law
Attorneys in and outside of Maryland spent the last week rushing to courthouses around the state to file claims for victims of institutional child sex abuse, working to beat the June 1 law that will cut potential awards in half and make it harder for victims to make multiple claims.
“Since this law was enacted by the legislature, even before the governor signed it, our firm has been devoting, — I’m not even exaggerating to say — probably about 80-plus percent of its time, energy efforts and resources, into getting these lawsuits filed,” said Emily Malarkey, a partner in the Baltimore firm Bekman, Marder, Hopper, Malarkey & Perlin.
In the last six weeks, Malarkey’s firm filed 50 lawsuits on behalf of 250 clients, just one firm among many representing potentially thousands of clients. One case came in at 10 p.m. Thursday, from an out-of-state firm that needed local attorneys to assist in filing.
“We’re exhausted,” Malarkey said. “It has been a Herculean effort, that was never our intended plan.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Those numbers are part of what drove lawmakers to pass the bill dramatically limiting a two-year old law that allowed victims who were otherwise barred from suing because of time limits to file civil lawsuits. The 2023 law created a scenario in which state and local governments could be on the hook for billions in potential liabilities.
Under the old law, damages were capped at $1.5 million per “occurrence” of abuse in a lawsuit against a private institution such as a school or church. In cases involving government entities, the cap was $890,000 per occurrence.
The new law slashes the caps as of June 1 — to $700,000 for private institutions and $400,000 for public institutions. And the “per occurrence” language goes away.
Lawmakers rushed to address the issue after legislative analysts warned in January that, under the old caps and with the potential of more than one occurrence per claimant, the cost to settle more than 3,100 cases that had been filed at the time could run into the billions. That would be troubling in good economic times, but the January warning came as the state was looking at an existing $3.3 billion structural deficit for fiscal 2026 and a similarly sized one for fiscal 2027.
The new law not only has financial consequences for victims. It could also limit the number of future cases, as lawyers consider whether they can afford to take on clients under the new caps.
“After June 1, it’s going to be really hard, I think, to find good representation, because not only did the legislature cut the cap, but the legislature cut the attorney fees that can be charged,” Malarkey said. “It’s going to be very difficult for businesses like mine to handle these complex, expensive, difficult cases stemming from decades ago, with dead witnesses and lost documents on a 20% contingency fee. We just can’t do it.”
Thousands of cases are pending in Maryland courts.
Malarkey said the vast majority — cases against the Archdiocese of Baltimore and the Department of Juvenile Services — will likely work their way through Baltimore City Circuit Courts. Prince George’s County courts will likely see the bulk of cases against from the Catholic Church’s Washington diocese. The rest, including cases against local schools and other institutions, will be heard in counties around the state.
What price power? New law doesn’t have quick answer
The Next Generation Energy Act that takes effect Sunday passed with just as much fanfare and will be felt by virtually every Marylander — but with none of the urgency of the Child Victims Act overhaul. The most immediate change, a rebate on people’s electric bills, won’t come before July.
In fact, the only noticeable change on June 1 is likely to be another increase in utility bills, while the law aimed at reining increases in grinds to life.

Senate Bill 937 and House Bill 1035 were part of a three-bill energy package touted by Democratic leaders in response to rising utility bills over the winter that blew up legislators’ phone lines and email inboxes with constituent complaints. The bills’ backers said the measures included short-, medium- and long-term solutions to complex issue of rising energy costs in Maryland.
The first change Marylanders will notice is the “Legislative Energy Relief Refund,” a credit averaging $80 per household that will be divided between bills next month and in January 2026. But the next round of rate increases is set to kick in after June 1.
Baltimore Gas & Electric customers got a break Thursday when the Maryland Public Service Commission ordered the utility to take next month’s expected $21 per month increase and spread it over several months, lowering the increase by $10 to $15 for the average household during the summer months. But rates will jump in September — overall, BGE customers will pay the same amount, but it will be spread out more evenly.
Customers of other utilities are likely to see increases between $4 and $18 per month, according to a report commissioned by the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.
Meanwhile, most of the bill’s provisions will unfold farther into the future.
The law includes changes at the PSC meant to rein in utility spending, including on new natural gas infrastructure, and encourage the construction of new power sources and energy storage technology — all with the goal of slowing price increases for ratepayers.
It calls for the PSC to open a procurement window — in October — for generators of “dispatchable” energy, which must contribute a certain amount of reliable energy to the grid with lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal or oil, according to the bill. It could include new natural gas, an option that angered environmentalists. The PSC will open another procurement window in January, for battery storage technology.
Environmentalists were pleased that the bill removes a renewable energy subsidy from trash incinerators that generate power, long one of their goals.

	Republican critics said the bill will do little to bolster in-state power generation, and blamed Democrats for driving fossil fuel power plants out of business and pushing costly clean energy policies on utilities. In fact, experts say the rate increases are caused by a combination of factors, from rising energy demand, to policies of regional electric grid operator PJM, to utilities pursuing overzealous improvements to the natural gas system.
Another bill in the Democrats’ package, which takes effect July 1, prevents local governments from banning large solar panel facilities through zoning. House Bill 1036/Senate Bill 931 raised concerns in farming communities, who worry that productive farmland could be lost to solar panels, but it’s not clear they will be able to meet a weekend deadline to petition it to referendum.
The final bill, to set up an energy planning office focused on the state’s long-term energy picture, was vetoed by Gov. Wes Moore (D), who said that other offices do that already and that it was too costly.
Delay for FAMLI, disappointment for immigrants
At least one new law does nothing — for another 18 months. The Family and Medical Leave Insurance program was supposed to start on July 1, but House Bill 102 defers the start of the program until Jan. 1, 2027. And that’s just the date when payroll deductions and employer contributions would start to be collected for the programs, benefits for someone who needed to take time off for a family issue of a health emergency would not start to be paid out until Jan. 1, 2028.
It is the third time the program start date has been pushed back since the FAMLI law was approved by lawmakers in 2022. Passage of the bill was a bitter pill for advocates, who said family emergencies can’t wait 18 months. Moore administration officials said the delay was unfortunate. But they also said that with the state facing a $3 billion budget deficit at the start of this year, and with continued uncertainty coming out of Washington under the  Trump administration, another delay was the only prudent thing to do.

The Maryland Values Act, meanwhile, does something, but it’s a lot less than its backers had hoped. As drafted, House Bill 1222 would have prohibited “287(g)” agreements, under which local police can essentially act as immigration agents, detaining people on suspicion of immigration violations and holding them for federal agents. A handful of sheriff’s departments in the state have entered into 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Senators stripped out the 287(g) language from the House bill and the Senate was not budging as the clock ticked down on the session. With literally minutes left in the 2025 General Assembly session, the House relented.
The final version of the Maryland Values Act has nothing on 287(g) but does add protections against release of immigrants’ personal records and other data the state holds. It also includes language to help “sensitive locations” — churches, schools, hospitals and the like — respond should federal agents show up. Those locations had been off limits to immigration enforcement under the Biden administration, but that restriction was quickly lifted under the Trump administration.
Studying guns in schools, more
House Bill 782 requires a thorough assessment of guns in the state’s public high schools and middle schools, and report on the best way to detect the presence of guns in schools and the best way to report such information to police. The law will take effect just days after the first-degree murder conviction Friday of Jaylen Rushawn Prince, 16, in the shooting death of 15-year-old Warren Curtis Grant in a bathroom at Joppatowne High School on Sept. 6, 2024, according to news reports.
The bill, originally sponsored by Del. Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard), calls on the Maryland Center for School Safety, a unit within the Maryland Department of Education, to meet with members of every local school system in the state and evaluate the security infrastructure currently in place. The center will also be required to evaluate “widely accepted” methods that are available but not currently used by school systems, analyze software that can be integrated with security cameras and study the use of metal detectors, even handheld devices, at school entrances.
The center will have to present an interim report to legislative leaders as well as to the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee by Dec. 1, 2025. A final report would be due by Dec. 1, 2026.
Other bills that become laws June 1 include:

Senate Bill 376 will require the Maryland Department of Health to regularly report to the legislature on the progress it has made to reduce a significant backlog of required annual nursing home inspections. Under the new law, the department will need to start providing quarterly reports to lawmakers on the progress of nursing home inspections, and the Office of Health Care Quality will have to report to local jurisdictions every six months on the progress of inspections in their individual counties.
Motorists using Interestate 83 in Baltimore will have to watch their speeds. House Bill 913, passed earlier this year, authorizes doubling the number of automated speed-monitoring devices on the city portion of the highway from two to four cameras.
For bills that ended up passing both chambers unanimously, lawmakers spent an inordinate amount of floor time — and offered an inordinate number of bad puns — for Senate Bill 544 and House Bill 559, the agritourism porta-potty bills. When the new law takes effect June 1, it will allow certain wineries, farm breweries and farms engaged in “agritourism” — like pick-your-own fields and corn mazes — to meet the requirement for on-site lavatory facilities by providing portable toilets with soap and water and located at least 25 feet from any wells.

And finally… chromite! And an orange crush
Two new state symbols — an official state mineral and a cocktail — join the list of about two dozen that includes official state sports, dogs, cats and dinosaurs, among others.
Chromite, a commercially valuable mineral first discovered in Baltimore County in the early 1800s, has become the official state mineral with the enactment of House Bill 411. The effort was a passion project for David Shore, who first testified on the bill nearly a decade ago. Now, at age 18, Shore’s effort not only passed the House and Senate but landed on the desk of the governor.
And the rising tide for chromite lifted another state symbol effort.
In the waning hours of the 2025 session, a bill making the orange crush — a vodka and juice drink invented in Ocean City — the official state cocktail was going nowhere. But as lawmakers were finishing their work, a late amendment in the House added Orange Crush to Senate Bill 764, the Senate’s version of the chromite bill. Senators concurred before the final gavel fell, and Maryland got an official state cocktail to go with its official mineral.

(Maryland Matters file photo)In his coverage of the downgrade of Maryland’s credit rating by Moody’s from the coveted AAA to AA1, Bryan Sears pointed to Moody’s acknowledgement of Maryland’s “wealthy and diverse economy,” solid financial planning and proactive management by officials, including slowing expenditures and raising new funds.
But the report also noted that Maryland was particularly vulnerable to “shifting Federal policies and employment” in comparison to other states with triple-A ratings: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
In plain-speak, Maryland’s administration was well equipped to handle any organic financial issues arising from budgetary deficits, and/or ambitiously funded programs. But our reliance on federal jobs meant that no one could foresee or plan for such eventualities.

Among all the states with a triple-A rating, Maryland’s economy is the only one which is dominated by the government sector. Being a small state and adjacent to the nation’s capital, Maryland’s largest source of income is income tax. Almost one in 10 Maryland workers is a federal employee. The only variable NOT in control of the state administration is the employment of federal workers.
It isn’t hard to see the connection.
Republican delegates and senators who tout Moody’s warnings about Maryland’s rating prior to this current federal administration taking charge are forgetting that the programs with high price tags, like the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, were hit because of the COVID-19 economy.
We barely had time to come up to the surface to take a breath of air before being submerged again by this second Trump administration! The GOP needs to take a hard look at themselves, and their blind obeisance to the walking body of malfeasance they regard as their president.
Here is the bottom line: Moody’s downgraded Maryland’s credit rating because, despite the Moore administration’s best efforts, they could not fix the damage done by DOGE and their dismantling of federal government.
Maryland, D.C. and Virginia have the maximum number of federal employees – both Maryland and D.C. had their ratings downgraded. Virginia is a much larger state and has other economic avenues to offset the loss of federal jobs, even though it, too, has taken a substantial hit to its economy.
Blame, if it is to be assigned, lies with the Trump administration and its hatchet approach to federal infrastructure. Believe me, the damage goes far beyond a credit rating — the United States will be feeling the effects of this sabotage for decades to come.
Fitch has since released its ratings on Maryland, and Standard & Poor’s followed on Wednesday. Maryland continued to maintain a triple-A ratings with both firms.
So let’s all take a deep breath, and return to resisting the illegal and unconstitutional actions of this federal administration.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/money-art-1-1.jpg,,,2025-05-31 01:59:31.119402

Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, rubs his eyes as House and Senate members of the education reform bill conference committee meet at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — After a drawn-out day of disagreements and false starts, the Vermont Legislature bailed on its plan to wrap up business for the year on Friday, failing to come to a deal, at least for now, on this year’s landmark education reform bill.So strained were the talks, the House and Senate couldn’t even immediately agree on when negotiations would continue.The Senate gaveled out for the night shortly after 11 p.m. Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, told his colleagues that coming to an agreement needed more time, and the Senate would instead gavel back in at 2 p.m. Saturday.“We’re going home now,” Baruth said. Soon after, around 11:30 p.m., the House adjourned until Monday at noon. From there, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said the chamber would be holding brief sessions without taking any actions, known as “token sessions,” until mid-June. That’s when legislators had previously penciled in to hold votes to override potential vetoes by Gov. Phil Scott.  “We’ve been putting compromises on the table all day, trying to find a path forward,” Krowinski said in an interview after ending her chamber’s business for the night. “This is a top priority for this legislative session, and we have to get it right. And at the end of the day, everyone was feeling like it needed more time.”Legislative leaders said they expect the joint House and Senate panel hashing out the education bill, H.454, to continue meeting in the coming weeks, though the schedule was not immediately clear.Both chambers signed off on a handful of other bills Friday, including sweeping housing legislation that would set out a program to finance infrastructure around new developments, a bill that would make it harder for neighbors to sue farmers over impacts the farm may have on their properties, and other bills on motor vehicles, cannabis and drug price caps.However, the outcome leaves the session’s highest-profile work unfinished. Following an election where property tax rates drove voters, leading to a wave of Republican victories in the House and Senate, Democratic legislative leadership pledged to heed voters’ call for a more affordable education system. Yet four months in, the path toward that future state remained murky.The parties began Friday closer than they ended it. Early in the day, the House and Senate conference committee members appeared to reach some tentative agreements on H.454. But as the hours wore on, negotiations — at least in public — faltered. The committee had been unable to lock in key details. Left unsettled was which funding formula to use, what to do about school choice and private schools and how to limit spending before school districts consolidate down the road. Meetings of the conference committee — three senators and three house members — were continuously postponed. Legislators and legislative staff scrambled in and out of rooms. Lobbyists lingered in the halls. As the conference committee drifted further and further from either chamber’s original position, the possibility of explaining the hugely complex and fast-changing piece of legislation to 180 lawmakers looked near-impossible. The vast majority of lawmakers dawdled as the conference committee worked in fits and starts, with people playing cards and sipping drinks throughout the Statehouse. The House, Senate and Scott have made education reform the year’s key issue. All three parties agreed on the need to consolidate school districts and transition the state to a new funding formula. But for months, the parties have reached little consensus on the intricacies and the timeline of that generational transformation. Baruth had told his chamber around 10 p.m. that agreement still looked possible.“It’s frustrating,” he said on the floor, describing the delay, “but the way I think about it is, your constituents and my constituents sent us here for this night because they want us to do our work, they want us to finish it up, pay strict attention and then be done and go home.”That proved overly optimistic.Read the story on VTDigger here:  With education bill at an impasse, Vermont Legislature kicks the can on adjournment.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/education-conference-4-20250530-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-31 01:01:26.306052

We reject the idea that there’s only so much to go around—especially when the numbers show otherwise.,"With just a few days left in this year’s legislative session, residents are waiting with bated breath to see whether the Connecticut legislature steps up and delivers a bold budget that invests in core programs, protects workers, tenants,  and immigrants, and meets the needs of our communities – or falls back on tired excuses and political theater.
Let’s be clear: Connecticut has the money.
It’s not because Governor Lamont can’t; it’s because he won’t.
We’ve heard it before: that supporting one group of workers must come at the expense of another; that if we fund fair contracts, we can’t fund public education; that if we invest in healthcare, we have to cut services somewhere else. But this is a false and dangerous narrative, and we will not allow it to divide us.
Nursing home and group home workers with SEIU 1199NE have exhibited bravery and determination in their contract fight and as a result have won state funding to support raises. But those purple shirts are still showing up at the State Capitol because this represents just one chapter of their fight.
People are multidimensional: they are workers, immigrants, parents, students, taxpayers, and more. We cannot silo issues just like we cannot silo people. Efforts to divide us only distract from the real issue: the Gov. Ned Lamont’s refusal to tax the wealthiest Connecticut residents or modify fiscal policies to reflect current realities.
We reject the idea that there’s only so much to go around—especially when the numbers show otherwise.
The state is sitting on a projected $2.3 billion surplus—the second largest in state history— and our Rainy Day Fund remains full. Meanwhile, our wealthiest residents and corporations continue to reap the economic benefits of our upside-down tax structure.
If Governor Lamont declares extraordinary circumstances, modifies the fiscal roadblocks and supports progressive taxation, our communities won’t just survive attacks from the federal government, but thrive in the face of adversity.
All year, thousands of advocates have testified, emailed, called and rallied, sharing the human stories that should be driving our budget process: Stories of students whose schools are facing millions in deficits; of looming layoffs to immigrant families left vulnerable by Governor Lamont’s veto threats on key protections in the TRUST Act; of workers facing stagnant wages and rising costs.
Faith, labor and community leaders have been clear about the robust investments that are needed across various issue areas. We cannot let proponents of the fiscal roadblocks use the victory of one group of workers as an excuse to cut other sectors. This narrative is not only divisive but also misleading. It pits one essential public service against another, ignoring the broader fiscal context and the state’s capacity to invest in all its communities.
This isn’t about choosing between students and nurses, or workers and services. It’s about whether we continue to govern by fear and austerity —or choose to invest in the future we all deserve.

The state Senate on Friday evening appeared likely to debate well into the night the details of what would be, if passed, the most significant piece of housing legislation to emerge from the Connecticut legislature in years.
House Bill 5002, which narrowly passed the House earlier this week after nearly 12 hours of debate, takes on zoning, parking policy and homelessness. It aims to increase housing supply, cut down on rent prices and encourage use of public transit, among other measures.
Over the past few years, housing costs have risen across the country. Homelessness has increased, and a recent study said Connecticut has the most constrained housing market in the nation.
“Housing is one of the biggest concerns when we knock on doors and talk with our constituents, every town hall, everything we hear is how housing is too scarce, it’s too expensive,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London.
Housing has long been a politically difficult issue in Connecticut. It’s growing harder for many families to afford to live in the state, and advocates say the state needs to do more to push zoning reform and other policies to make housing cheaper.
But Republicans, some moderate Democrats and opponents of H.B. 5002 say they think control of these issues should remain with local government.
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, who has been a vocal opponent of many of the ideas in the bill, questioned the existence of a housing crisis during debate Friday.
“If there is a housing shortage, it’s simply based on the fact that there’s not enough affordable listings for housing available out there in the marketplace,” he said, saying it’s “either not being advertised, or it’s not being made available by the people that possess it.”
He said there would be a housing crisis if there wasn’t enough housing for the population, and Connecticut hasn’t seen much population growth in recent years.
Experts and economists say housing shortages are more complicated than that. The market needs vacancies in order to keep costs down, and even when there is not population growth, there can be household growth as children get older and leave their parents’ homes.
Leaders on Friday said it seemed likely some Democrats would side with Republicans voting against the bill, and it could be a narrow margin for passage.
Planning and zoning
One policy in the bill, which drew political angst, is known as “Towns Take the Lead,” which is similar to fair share measures proposed in past sessions.
The proposal divides housing need among towns based on regional need and assigns each town a set number of units to plan and zone for, with those proposals required to be included in their 8-30j plans, which are due every five years. 
It uses a formula to determine how many units of affordable housing towns need to plan and zone for, with a general goal to increase housing stock and cut down on segregation. The bill contains some other specifications for the housing, including requirements to build units for families and for certain income levels.
Under the bill language, towns can contest their assigned numbers and tell the legislature how many units they think they can accommodate, and lawmakers will approve or deny the towns’ proposals.

The legislation also includes Gov. Ned Lamont’s proposal to offer towns easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g. The decades-old housing law offers developers court remedies if their affordable housing proposals are denied, unless it’s for a reason of health or safety.
Towns can get moratoriums under the law by showing they’re making progress toward increasing their percentage of designated affordable housing and are exempt from the law if at least 10% of their housing stock is designated affordable.
Lamont’s proposal allows municipalities to establish a “priority housing development zone” that set a minimum density of four units per acre for single-family housing, six for duplexes or townhouses and 10 for multi-family housing.
The zones allow this type of development “as of right,” or without a special hearing before the local planning and zoning commission. Towns that adopt these zones have easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g.
It’s a controversial proposal among housing advocates who oppose changes to 8-30g and say too many adjustments could render the law ineffective.
The bill also aims to get towns to increase residential density near train and bus stations by prioritizing certain infrastructure funding for towns that establish “transit-oriented districts,” where certain development is allowed as of right before the planning and zoning commission.
The bill, known as Work, Live, Ride, and pushed by advocacy group Desegregate Connecticut aims to increase the housing stock and encourage people to use public transportation, which advocates say is good for the environment.
Opponents say the prioritization of funding means that towns that don’t participate in the program could risk losing funding they need for roads and bridges.
Town requirements
The bill bans minimum off-street parking requirements for certain residential developments. This allows developers to cut down on building costs by not adding as many parking spaces. 
Advocates say removing parking minimums allows more housing to be built in areas that may already have sufficient street parking or are close to public transportation. Meanwhile, opponents say it weakens local control and runs the risk that developers will ignore parking needs.
The bill requires towns to allow developers to convert commercial buildings to residential with nine or fewer units without a special hearing before the planning and zoning commission.
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, said it will use office space and other commercial areas that have been empty since the COVID-19 pandemic. Opponents say it will usurp local control.
H.B. 5002 also includes a couple of measures to help the unhoused population. It bans towns from using so-called “hostile architecture” on public property. Hostile architecture is an urban design architecture in which certain public structures are designed to discourage behaviors such as sleeping or lying down in public. It often comes in the form of spiked surfaces under bridges, narrow benches or rocks strewn across grassy areas.
Homelessness has been increasing over the past few years in Connecticut, and as shelters reach capacity, more people are forced to stay outside.

The bill also expands the number of fair rent commissions in Connecticut, mandating that any town with a population of 15,000 or more establish a commission, which are local bodies empowered to hear and make legally binding rulings on landlord-tenant issues such as complaints about unfair rent increases or housing conditions.
This year’s bill requires an additional 32 towns to have fair rent commissions and allow towns to establish regionalized commissions through their local councils of government, according to 2023 population estimates.
Supporters say the commissions help make sure rent increases aren’t excessive. Opponents fear that small towns may struggle to find people to volunteer to be members of the commissions.
If passed, the bill next heads to Lamont’s desk for his approval.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_280-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 23:58:59.304280

CHICAGO — Federal prosecutors are asking for a lengthy 12 ½-year prison sentence for former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, calling the longtime Democratic power broker “steeped in corruption” and alleging he lied on the witness stand when he testified in his own defense earlier this year.

In their 72-page filing Friday evening, prosecutors also called for a $1.5 million fine in addition to prison time for the 10 corruption charges — including bribery — on which Madigan was convicted in February.

“The crimes charged and proven at trial demonstrate that Madigan engaged in corrupt activity at the highest level of state government for nearly a decade,” prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum. “Time after time, Madigan exploited his immense power for his own personal benefit by trading his public office for private gain for himself and his associates, all the while carefully and deliberately concealing his conduct from detection.”

But in a competing filing published to the court docket two hours later, Madigan’s attorneys argued the former speaker should only serve five years’ probation, including a year of home detention followed by community service.

Madigan is scheduled to be sentenced June 13.

Along with Madigan’s legal arguments for no prison time, his attorneys also filed hundreds of pages of character letters asking U.S. District Judge John Blakey for leniency in sentencing, upon which Madigan’s lawyers bolstered their request.

“Throughout his 83-year life, Mike quite literally changed the lives of tens of thousands of people in his district on the south side of Chicago,” Madigan’s filing stated. “He positively impacted millions of people throughout the State of Illinois. The more than 200 letters submitted on Mike’s behalf demonstrate that this is not hyperbole.”

Madigan, who stepped away from public life in early 2021 as the feds’ investigation swirled around his inner circle, spent five decades in the Illinois House, including 36 as House speaker — the longest tenure of any legislative leader in the country. He also spent 23 years as head of the state’s Democratic Party, granting him even more power over Illinois’ political landscape.

Split verdict

After three months of testimony from more than 60 witnesses and dozens of hours of secretly recorded audio and video, a jury convicted Madigan on 10 of 23 counts he was facing. But jurors acquitted the former speaker on seven counts and deadlocked on another six, including an overarching racketeering charge.

The former speaker’s convictions involved alleged bribery from electric utility Commonwealth Edison, which hired five of the speaker’s allies on no-work contracts at various times from 2011 and 2019 — an eight-year period during which ComEd was pushing for major legislation in the General Assembly. The jury also convicted Madigan on supporting counts related to an alleged scheme to help get Chicago alderman-turned-FBI mole Danny Solis appointed to a lucrative state board position, though he was acquitted of the bribery charge pertaining to the same alleged scheme.

Some of the trial’s most dramatic moments came in January, when Madigan made the stunning decision to testify in his own defense. The high-risk move opened him up to blistering cross-examination from lead prosecutor Amarjeet Bhachu, who left the U.S. Attorney’s office in March and isn’t a party to sentencing recommendations.

Over two days, Bhachu sparred with the former speaker, and weeks later he and his colleagues quoted Madigan’s testimony back to the jury during closing arguments in an attempt to prove he’d lied on the witness stand.

Prosecutors leaned on that alleged perjury once more in Friday’s sentencing memorandum, counting his “obstructive conduct” as a key justification for their sentencing recommendation.

“Madigan has expressed no remorse for his crimes, nor has he acknowledged the damage wrought by his conduct,” prosecutors wrote. “Indeed, Madigan went so far as to commit perjury at trial in an effort to avoid accountability, and he persists in framing his actions as nothing more than helping people.”

Madigan repeatedly claimed — and his attorneys repeatedly argued — that he was ignorant of the fact that the collective $1.3 million his allies earned from their ComEd contracts was for performing no work. Instead, the former speaker and his lawyers framed those contracts as the result of mere job recommendations, which they argued was a core component of Madigan’s job as speaker.

But as a result of Madigan’s testimony, U.S. District Judge John Blakey reversed a pre-trial decision and allowed prosecutors to play a damning wiretapped phone call for the jury in which Madigan laughed about ComEd contractors having “made out like bandits.” In the call, the former speaker’s co-defendant, longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, laughed, too, replying, “for very little work.”

Prosecutors cited that call in its Friday filing as evidence the former speaker wasn’t forthcoming when he ""testified that McClain never said he believed or suspected that any of the people that Madigan had referred to ComEd were not working.”

“This testimony was a lie,” the feds wrote in their filing.

Prosecutors also ripped Madigan’s attempts on the witness stand to distance himself from McClain, his longtime close friend and advisor, which the feds said “completely undermined” the former speaker’s “credibility as a witness.”

“The multitude of recorded conversations, emails, and documents presented at trial established a uniquely close and longstanding relationship of mutual dependence between Madigan and McClain and demonstrated that Madigan was lying when he tried to distance himself from his key operative,” prosecutors wrote.

“Madigan assigned McClain, and only McClain, to carry out the most sensitive assignments and requests and to engage in the most potentially politically explosive conversations when Madigan wanted bad news delivered, including to legislators who served under Madigan.”

The jury in February deadlocked on all six counts pertaining to McClain, but he faces his own sentencing in July on charges related to the ComEd bribery scheme after a jury in May 2023 convicted him and three other ex-utility executives and lobbyists for their roles.

Plea for leniency

Of the more than 200 letters filed Friday with Madigan’s legal arguments for a non-custodial sentence, many came from former constituents or other Illinoisans who wrote about how the former speaker helped them in some way.

Letters also came from prominent faith leaders across the state, 40 former staffers, prominent labor leaders and three dozen former elected officials, among them several Republicans like former Gov. Jim Edgar. Attorneys also included an op-ed in support of Madigan penned by former GOP Gov. Jim Thompson before his death in 2020.

All four of Madigan’s children wrote lengthy letters, including former Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, whom the former speaker adopted after marrying her mother Shirley in 1976. In addition to writing about how Madigan operated in the world of Illinois government and politics that her adoptive father introduced her to, Lisa Madigan’s letter highlighted what the former speaker’s attorneys called “a key consideration” for Madigan’s sentencing: his wife’s health.

“Mike keeps my mother alive,” Lisa Madigan wrote in her letter, which said Shirley Madigan suffers from “a severe lung disease” and has “rarely been well enough to leave the house” in the last five years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as she’s “extremely susceptible to infections” and has been hospitalized three times.

“She is able to remain in their house primarily because of the care my father provides,” Lisa Madigan wrote. “He shops for groceries, brings her food (as you heard during the trial), does laundry, and generally takes care of her and their house.”

Lisa Madigan was referring to a lighthearted moment on one of the wiretapped calls played for the jury in which the then-speaker read a menu of soup options to his wife over the phone.

Madigan’s attorneys wrote that even “one day of imprisonment” for Madigan “will upend her (Shirley’s) entire life.”

“Mike presence is medically necessary to provide the direct assistance, supervision, and emotional support required to maintain Shirley’s well-being in a familiar home environment, which is paramount for patients with Shirley’s conditions,” the filing said, going on to refer to Madigan as Shirley’s “caretaker.”

The former speaker’s lawyers also referred to Madigan’s own age as a mitigating factor for sentencing, though leaned more heavily on kneecapping prosecutors’ arguments that a 12 ½-year sentence would serve as a deterrent.

“The defendant respectfully submits that a sentence of imprisonment would be greater than necessary to protect the public or deter him from criminal conduct,” the filing read. “Mike does not pose a risk of committing new crimes. He will never hold public office again.”

Madigan’s attorneys went on to detail “intense public embarrassment for (the former speaker) and his family,” which they argued “is a significant punishment in and of itself.” They also claimed the former speaker’s grandchildren “are teased at school” because of Madigan’s criminal case.

“As one example, Mike was publicly compared to a mob boss,” Madigan’s filing read. “Politicians also continue to use Mike as a cheap political shot, without any regard for his history of good works and positive impact on Illinois. ... He will also live the rest of his years as a felon.”

Other notable letter-writers on Madigan’s behalf included former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Tom Kilbride, Democratic mega- fundraisers Michael Sacks and Fred Eychaner and Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. While many former Democratic allies of Madigan penned appeals to Judge Blakey, only a few currently hold office — among them state Reps. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, and Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, along with Auditor General Frank Mautino.

Several authors of Madigan’s character letters had testified in trial, including his former law partner Vincent “Bud” Getzendanner, whose time on the witness stand was spent trying to explain the ethical firewall the Madigan & Getzendanner real estate law firm had with official state business.

In his letter, Getzendanner joked that he was “pretty sure” Madigan was “only human” and also poked a hole in the longtime Springfield mythology Madigan’s daily lunchtime apple, which he said demonstrated the former speaker’s “famous willpower.”

“Strangely enough, on many occasions I subsequently found an unexplained residue of chocolate chip cookie crumbs on his plate,” Getzendanner wrote, later apologizing to the judge for his sense of humor.

The bill now heads to the House and, if passed into law, would create a groundbreaking new fund for early childhood education that draws from surplus funds, with up to $300 million invested each year. Also included in the bill are new supports related to special education for school districts, teachers and students.
Advocates cheered and legislators embraced on Friday night after the passage of Senate Bill 1, calling it a major step forward in a state where the too-small and underfunded early childhood education sector has made it difficult for working families, especially mothers, to pay for and even find quality infant, toddler and pre-K programming for their kids.
Advocates of the bill include Gov. Ned Lamont, who pledged in February to make a game-changing investment in early childhood, drawing on surplus funds. At the time, Lamont was focused on creating a universal pre-K fund. S.B. 1 represents a more wide-ranging effort to create not just free or low-cost pre-K but also slots for infant and toddler care, something that advocates and educators say is sorely needed.
Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye said Friday that the governor was feeling great about the bill.
“The governor was very flexible with that (infant and toddler spots),” Bye said, “because he knows that’s a big challenge, too.” 
Under the plan, families making up to $100,000 a year would pay nothing for the child care services, which would be run through Early Start programs, while families making more than $100,000 a year would pay no more than 7% of their annual income, with no income limit. The bill would also improve salaries for workers in those centers so that they’re more in line with public school teacher salaries and includes a health care subsidy program for those workers.
As the Senate prepared to vote on the bill, President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, discussed a report from Dalio Education on “disconnected youth” as a motivator. Looney said, “so many of our children come to kindergarten unprepared to be there,” and then experience humiliation when they realize they are already behind their peers. He said that sets them on a path toward disconnection from school down the road, whereas the proposed bill would create a chance to come to school prepared for success.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, who is co-chair of the Committee on Children, celebrated the bill’s passage. 
“I’m so excited about this transformational bill, for parents, for providers, for advocates, for everyone who has had a hand in this, from the governor to OPM to the office of the treasurer, to the legislature,” she said. “It means we are making a permanent investment in the future of child care in our state, and it is the first state in the union to do this.”
Maher said what distinguishes Connecticut from states like Vermont and New Mexico, which have also made investments in early childhood education, is that Connecticut is taking a holistic approach to trying to make improvements throughout the system, from provider pay to creating more spaces. “It will change the nature of child care in Connecticut,” she said.
But critics of the bill argued that the state would be violating its fiscal guardrails in using surplus money to pay for it all. Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, attempted and failed to pass an amendment to the bill that would have used money from the general fund instead of surplus funds. Harding argued that in using surplus funds, legislators were being dishonest with their constituents.
“You’re telling your constituency, ‘Well, legally we can do this within the guardrails,’ but you know as we all know that it violates the spirit of why the guardrails are there,” he said.
Harding said that the surplus should only go toward one of two things: the rainy day fund or paying down the state’s debt. “If we can’t find $40 million as a priority in a multibillion dollars budget toward early childhood and early education initiatives, I think our priorities are lost,” he said.
But the bill’s transformational aspirations rely on using surplus funds, and socking them away into an endowment that would grow over time. As time goes on, 10% of those funds could be used each year, an ever-larger sum as the fund continues to build. 
While there may have been disagreement earlier in the session about the best path forward to address the early childhood education crisis, the smiles, handshakes and cheers from lawmakers and advocates who had once championed different bills showed unity. 
“This is the result of a long, constructive set of negotiations to try and get to something that really works,” said Merrill Gay, the executive director of the CT Early Childhood Alliance.
“It’s amazing, said Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman, the coalition director of Child Care for CT, “and next year we’ll be back to ask for more money.”
The bill also includes supports for special education, which Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox, D-Trumbull, said respond to feedback collected by the Select Committee on Special Education, which she co-chairs. 
The bill includes a $10 million grant to create better special education programming in some districts so that students don’t have to travel out of district. And it requires programs to send out notifications when staffing changes, like substitute teachers, last more than 10 school days — disruptions that can have a big impact on special education students. It also creates an educational ombudsman who would help mediate issues that arise when families are having trouble accessing services. The special education provisions in the bill complement those in House Bill 5001.
“Education has to be a priority for Connecticut, we are building our future,” Gadkar-Wilcox said. From early childhood to special education to higher education, “we need to think about how these pieces are interconnected.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_Session_148-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 23:00:43.612625

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — A bill that would make a host of changes to the state’s election laws, including an expansion of who must file campaign finance disclosures, appeared to be facing dim prospects Friday — even though the House approved the legislation in March.The reason the bill, H.474, hadn’t yet advanced in the Senate, on what could be the final day of this year’s legislative session?“He’s right there,” Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas told VTDigger at the Statehouse Friday afternoon, pointing at Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, as he walked by in a hallway.According to the secretary, Baruth told Rutland Republican Sen. Brian Collamore, chair of the Senate Government Operations Committee, which has been reviewing the elections bill, not to advance it to the floor unless the House Government Operations Committee advanced another, unrelated bill — a Burlington charter change proposal on which Baruth is the primary sponsor.Rep. Matt Birong, D-Vergennes, said the House panel he chairs didn’t have the votes to pass out the Burlington bill, S.131, which would ban guns from bars and other venues that serve alcohol in the city.  The Senate passed the measure last month, though Gov. Phil Scott has signaled he does not support it.“We were told that the (elections) bill would not move until the Burlington charter” advanced in the House, Birong said in an interview Friday on the House floor.Baruth also lives in Burlington and represents the city in the Senate.Asked about Copeland Hanzas and Birong’s comments Friday evening, Baruth said, “I wouldn’t repeat private conversations” and contended that he “wouldn’t link” the charter change with the elections bill.Secretary of State Sarah Copeland-Hanzas speaks about small donation campaign finance reform during a press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on June 18, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerBaruth said the elections bill wasn’t moving forward in the Senate because lawmakers ran out of time to take it up amid other competing proposals. Legislative leaders had been planning to adjourn for the year late Friday, though it wasn’t certain they would. “Burlington has waited 12 years for that charter — and it’s crazy that it’s being held up in the House,” the pro tem added. The city also attempted to get a ban on guns in bars approved by the Legislature in 2014, but wasn’t successful.Copeland Hanzas and Deputy Secretary of State Lauren Hibbert were both at the Statehouse Friday pushing to get the election bill over the finish line, Copeland Hanzas said. As it passed the House, the bill also includes a slate of measures she said would improve how municipal clerks can run local elections.Copeland Hanzas accused Baruth of playing “political gamesmanship.”“The important reforms that are in that elections bill are going to benefit every single municipal clerk across the state, and benefit our office and make it easier for us to ensure that we have fair, secure and error-free elections,” she said. “And so for one person to stand in the way of it is, really, unacceptable.”Copeland Hanzas added that it’s possible the bill would not advance in a similar form during next year’s session, in 2026, because legislators typically try to avoid making many changes to election laws in a year when they, themselves, would be on the ballot.Collamore, the Senate Government Operations Committee chair, said Friday that he believed his committee would have passed out the election bill with four of its five members in support. He declined to say whether Baruth, the pro tem, had influenced the bill’s fate.“I won’t comment on that,” he said in an interview Friday evening. Birong said some Democrats on his House committee were concerned the charter change would be confusing if guns were prohibited in bars in one city, but nowhere else in the state.Gov. Phil Scott had expressed similar concerns with the bill and told reporters last week at a press conference he would veto it if it reached his desk. Legislators would be unlikely to succeed on a vote to override any potential veto this year. Birong had strong words for the pro tem, as well.“I find it very discouraging that, especially in this day and age where we’re trying to do everything we can to maintain the sanctity of our elections, that a charter request from the pro tem’s district would jeopardize such an essential piece of legislation,” he said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Election bill falters at 11th hour after Senate president ties its fate to Burlington gun bill he backed.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/phil-baruth-1-20250523-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 22:01:18.992622

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Democrats introduced what a leading budgeteer described as a $55 billion budget Friday evening ahead of a Saturday deadline to pass the fiscal year 2026 spending plan.

The 3,363-page spending proposal was unveiled after 6 p.m. At the time the Senate’s lead budget negotiator, Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, briefed reporters on the plan; an exact proposal for raising about $1 billion in revenue to pay for it had not been made publicly available.

But Sims said lawmakers are not using broad tax hikes to balance the budget, although the plan does call for specific tax increases in certain areas. Sims said the proposal includes new taxes on gambling as well as tobacco and vape products. He also hinted that some businesses will pay more under the plan – though Illinois’ constitution mandates that the state corporate income tax remain a flat rate.

“We're trying to make sure that individuals pay their fair share, and corporations, who are the most prosperous are most profitable, also pay their fair share,” Sims said.

The plan is roughly in line with what Gov. JB Pritzker proposed in his February budget address as budget talks in Congress have injected uncertainty in state finances.

“This budget recognizes that there are significant challenges that we have, that we will face, and it makes sure that the chaos that is coming out of Washington, we're prepared for it,” Sims told reporters Friday night. “We're not running away from our responsibility. We're running towards it.”

A health care program that provides benefits to undocumented immigrants in Illinois between ages 42 and 64 also appears to be eliminated. Pritzker proposed eliminating the program to save the state $330 million.

“He did not include the HBIA (Health Benefits for Immigrant Adults) program in the budget,” Sims said. “But again, that's in recognition of the challenges that we're seeing coming out of Washington and the devastating effects that those proposals are having on our state and states across the country.”

Pritzker proposed a $55.2 billion spending plan in February, but revenue forecasts have declined since then. The latest estimate in early May from the governor’s office pegged FY26 revenue at $54.9 billion while the General Assembly’s independent Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability projected revenue would come in at $54.5 billion – $1 billion below Pritzker’s February revenue estimate.

Expected declines in federal funding and a diminishing economic outlook have caused the downward revisions.

But the yet-to-be-filed revenue plan would make up a little over $1 billion in revenue, according to Sims.

Another source of new revenue in the budget proposal is a delinquent tax payment incentive program. The program is designed to help the state recuperate overdue tax payments. The program was proposed by Pritzker and is estimated to generate about $198 million in revenue.

With Medicaid funding cuts possible from Congress, Sims said the budget makes “significant” increases for the state’s hospital systems, in particular safety-net hospitals. He said the plan also builds in wage increases for direct service providers.

The proposed budget also fully funds the annual increase to the K-12 evidenced-based funding model with $350 million.

Lawmakers will also see their salaries rise as part of the budget, going to a $98,304 base salary from roughly $92,000. That’s an annualized rate of increase that is set by law.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Two weeks ago, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced a hiring freeze for most state agencies, paused new state regulations, and restricted state workers’ travel.
The governor’s administrative order arrived amid growing concerns about state spending, and much of it is similar to orders issued during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency and the oil price shock of the mid-2010s.
But this order has a new wrinkle: a pause on new state regulations.
“In order for agencies to focus their attention on the State’s core mission of providing essential services to Alaskans and maximizing operational efficiency, there is, effective immediately, a freeze on the promulgation of new regulations by all agencies. This freeze does not apply to regulations currently out for public notice,” the governor’s new order states.
If laws enacted by the Legislature and governor are the building blocks of state government, regulations are the mortar that holds them together: Regulations, proposed by state agencies or boards and commissions, cover the details that laws don’t, prescribing how state agencies should implement those laws.
“Governor Dunleavy issued Administrative Order 358 to ensure we are spending wisely and living within our means. This temporary pause on new regulations gives agencies time to evaluate priorities and reduce unnecessary regulatory growth,” said Jessica Bowers, a spokesperson for Dunleavy.
Since Dunleavy’s order, the state’s public records system shows only one new regulations package has been posted for public comment. In the same period last year, the online public records system shows seven. There were three during the same stretch of 2023 and five during that stretch of 2022.
This year, one of the biggest items affected by the governor’s order is a packet of regulations that would fully implement last year’s Ballot Measure 1, which requires paid sick leave and a minimum wage increase for workers starting July 1.
The measure, which was approved by 58% of participating Alaska voters last year, also forbids “captive audience meetings,” in which employees must listen to an employer’s views on religion, politics or unions.
New regulations require a 30-day comment period where the public can suggest changes to the final draft, and those regulations typically don’t become effective until 30 days after the final version is signed by the lieutenant governor.
In March, Adam Weinert, a special assistant to state Department of Labor Commissioner Cathy Muñoz, said that “the regulation packet is currently with the Alaska Department of Law, and we intend to have the packet out for a 30-day public comment in the near future.”
More than two months later, the packet still has not been published for public comment. The Department of Labor has not answered multiple requests for further information.
The delay has alarmed some of the measure’s supporters, who think it could be part of a national pattern.
In Nebraska and Missouri, voters also passed paid sick leave ballot measures last year. In both places, state legislators proceeded to overturn those ballot measures this spring.
Here in Alaska, five Republican members of the state House introduced a bill that would roll back Alaska’s voter-approved law.
“As those issues have won at the ballot box, really since 2016, we have seen an escalation of attacks to direct democracy and voter-approved initiatives,” said Chris Melody Fields, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a national progressive organization.
“We’ve seen that especially on the economic justice ballot measures that were passed in 2024,” she said.
The Alaska bill lacks the support needed to pass the House or Senate and may be unconstitutional, which leaves regulatory hurdles as the last obstacle before it becomes effective.
Bowers, in the governor’s office, cited the text of the governor’s administrative order and said that agencies “can submit a waiver to move forward with paused regulations if the regulations are necessary to protect the safety of the public or to meet other essential State responsibilities.”
By email, she confirmed that the Department of Labor has submitted a waiver request and that it is under review. 
The Alaska Department of Law, which has been examining the regulations package for more than two months, did not answer a question on Friday seeking information about the status of that review.
Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska chapter of the AFL-CIO, a federation of 63 national and international labor unions, said that regardless of what happens with the regulations, Ballot Measure 1 will become law on July 1.
She supported the measure and has been tracking its implementation with interest. 
“Those regs need to have a 30-day comment period … they should have been out 90 days ago, so they could have taken in public comment,” she said.
Without regulations, Alaskans will still be entitled to sick leave and a higher minimum wage, but employers might not know how to keep track of that sick leave and report it properly, she said.
She noted that the Department of Labor has an FAQ about the measure.
Other organizations, including the Foraker Group and the law firm Landye Bennett Blumstein have also published detailed explanations on the new law going into effect.
Attorney Scott Kendall said that a regulations package could still go forward after the law becomes effective. 
But Hall said that still leaves employers guessing.
“You’re going to have a lot of employers who are confused about how they’re going to track things,” she said.
Of the state’s decision to wait on releasing regulations, she said, “I’m not sure what they think they’re doing aside from confusing people.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/250422-Capitol-flags-copy-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 22:01:18.992622

It’s the latest wave of immigrants from Southeast Asia to come to the state. This is part one of a  five part audio series, Mabuhay sa Alaska, by KMXT and breaks down how and why those teachers are here, as well as what it means for both Alaska, and the island nation.
Serjoe Gutierrez stood above the Kodiak High School Orchestra, violin in hand, as students rifled through their sheet music for pieces like “The Barber of Seville” and “Canyon Sunset.” Gutierrez often plays with his students instead of conducting them.
Gutierrez, who was born and raised in the Philippines, was in his fifth year of teaching there when he decided he wanted to try to work in another country.
“I think it’s time for me to come out of my comfort zone, explore a lot of opportunities, since I’m still young,” he said.
Alaska wasn’t high on his list. Kodiak barely made it on his radar.
“Kodiak was the last school district I applied to because it was the last school district that pop(ped) out of my Google browser,” Gutierrez said. “And I told myself, ‘Well if not in Kodiak, maybe the United States is not for me.’”
He’s now in his third year of teaching here.

Gutierrez’s immigration story is one of hundreds already playing out in schools all over Alaska, from the Aleutians to the North Slope to Southeast, as dozens of school districts have hired from the Philippines amid a national shortage of certified teachers.
School districts are cutting out the middleman
Gutierrez has become well known in Kodiak. Parents chat with him at student concerts, and he hosts a Filipino music show on KMXT. He plays piano at a local church, as well as violin for charity auctions and in the community’s theater.
He has even joined the Kodiak Island Borough School district’s efforts to recruit more teachers from his home country. In January, Gutierrez helped lead a group of Alaska school administrators on a recruiting trip to the Philippines.

Until recently, school districts have relied on third-party agencies to recruit teachers. But with demand up and opportunities to cut out middlemen, Kodiak’s district has led the way to recruit directly from the Philippines.
Some parents and Kodiak community members have criticized the practice for being too expensive. Kodiak Island Borough School District spent about $28,000 to send a team of 4 people this year, including Gutierrez. Teams like that screen hundreds of candidates in a single trip.
Working with lawyers and visa fees cost an additional $7,000 per teacher hired. Districts also can pay another $2,400 if they want to work with immigration lawyers to extend visas.
Hiring through an agency can cost a district about $27,000 per teacher.
And districts aren’t the only ones that pay when going through agencies. When Gutierrez started looking for work abroad three years ago, he had to pay $50 just to learn how to apply for jobs in other countries. Many teachers in the Philippines make only about $400 per month. He’s heard of some agencies charging teachers thousands of dollars once they’ve been placed in the U.S.
“The best of the best”
It took the group of administrators about two days to travel from Anchorage to the Philippines for the most recent recruitment trip. On the first day of recruiting, in a hotel conference space near Manila, candidates wore Western dresses and suits – even tuxedos. Others wore traditional Filipino formal wear, like embroidered shirts called barong tagalogs and distinctly shouldered filipinianas.

The room was full of candidates with graduate and postgraduate degrees. Some of the administrators said that on recruiting trips within the U.S., candidates were often fresh from their undergraduate colleges.
The Bering Strait School District has hired up to 60 teachers in a single year – about a third of its total teaching staff. The district has hired international teachers through an agency before, but this was its first time sending someone to recruit directly.
Tera Cunningham leads the district’s human resources. She’d never seen so many people vying for teaching jobs in Alaska.
“It’s exciting to see so many well-trained, well-prepared people who genuinely just want to help kids,” she said.
  Recruiters like Tera Cunningham work in teams of two to screen eight people at a time. (Photo by Brian Venua/KMXT)
 
The candidates had only a few minutes to introduce themselves and impress the administrators. Out of the first group of 120 candidates, less than a third had callbacks that day.
“It is intense to do it this way, and we know we’ll get the best of the best here,” Cunningham said.
She said meeting candidates in person helps her visualize them in action.
“And so I’m excited to see who that looks like, what that looks like when they make it through and they’re finally at our sites,” she said.
But not every school district can afford to visit the Philippines. That’s part of why Jennifer Schmidt with the Alaska Council of School Administrators joined the group. She said that the trip makes sense for districts with many openings, but some have only one or two.
The council, which handles the Alaska teacher and personnel system, received grant money from the U.S. Department of Education to improve the state’s retention and recruitment.
Kodiak’s school district has led the recruiting trips so far, but Schmidt said the eventual goal is for her to take the lead. She said ideally, schools wouldn’t need to recruit from abroad, but there just aren’t enough American and Alaska-grown candidates.
“It’s going to take a lot of turnaround and a lot of change in the state of Alaska for us to have enough teachers in Alaska and in the U.S. that are going to want to come and teach there,” she said.

SPRINGFIELD — Criminal justice reform advocates say legislation to seal criminal records for certain nonviolent crimes, which passed Friday in the House, would unlock economic opportunity for thousands of Illinoisans.

The so-called Clean Slate Act has failed twice before, but activists see renewed fiscal messaging as the key to reinvigorating the campaign. This time, the bill’s sponsor points to a “diverse coalition of stakeholders” and backing from business groups as signs Illinois could become the 13th state to enact similar legislation.

“This is something I've worked on for six long years, and now we have law enforcement and the business community — folks like the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, the Illinois Manufacturers Association — all on board,” Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth, D-Peoria, said in an interview. “Not as a neutral party, but they are proponents. They want to see this bill passed.”

Like earlier proposals, Senate Bill 1784 would require law enforcement agencies to automatically seal records for nonviolent criminal convictions twice a year — Jan. 1 and July 1. The records would no longer be public, although law enforcement and state’s attorneys would retain access.

Gordon-Booth has sponsored Clean Slate legislation twice before — once in 2021 and again in 2023 — but neither bill progressed past committee.

Just a few days before the 2025 legislative session concludes, she filed it again. Within two days, it passed the House mostly along partisan lines, and is headed for debate on the Senate floor.

The session ends at midnight Saturday, although the bill could still pass after that deadline.

People convicted of certain violent offenses — including sex crimes against minors, DUI, reckless driving and violent offenses that require sex offender registration — would be ineligible to have their records sealed.

“I want to make this very, very clear: Serious criminal records are not eligible for automated sealing,” Gordon-Booth said during floor debate.

Gordon-Booth argued that conviction records trap formerly incarcerated individuals in a state of perpetual punishment, eclipsing access to employment, housing and educational opportunities. She said Clean Slate would remove these barriers, helping system-impacted people reintegrate into society instead of recidivating.

Paul Rothschild, managing director of operations for the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishment — a group that advocates for the rights of people with criminal records — said he agrees. He said the justice system fails to follow through on its own promise: Once someone has served their time, they are entitled to a second chance.

“We believe that people should be accountable for the crimes that they commit. But we also believe there is an implied covenant that when they finish, they're supposed to be returned to the world made whole, and that covenant is not being kept by society. They're being forever subjugated in that lower caste, that lower class,” Rothschild said.

More than 3 million Illinoisans have arrest or conviction records, and an estimated 921,000 people are eligible for “sealing relief” — but only about 10% actually petition to have their records cleared, according to statistics from Live Free Illinois, a grassroots organization aimed at reforming the state criminal justice system and part of the Clean Slate Illinois steering committee, which coordinates the campaign’s messaging and advocacy efforts.

The bill would automate the process for individuals with nonviolent convictions to have their records sealed, once they have served their sentences, completed probation, and remained crime-free.

Many eligible individuals are deterred by steep fines, complex paperwork and long waiting periods, Gordon-Booth said. The “burdensome” process has contributed to massive court backlogs, according to Clean Slate Illinois.

“It’s going to automate the process, so this way we don't have to go through that whole trying to get the paperwork, trying to go through all the rigmarole,” said Chauncy Stockdale, who was formerly incarcerated and is now a member of the Live Free Illinois Fellowship, a reentry program that supports returning citizens.

The measure passed the House 81-28, with five Republicans joining Democrats in support of the measure. No Democrats voted against the bill.




During debate on the House floor, Minority Floor Leader Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, voiced concerns about the tentative $18 million price tag, and whether the state is capable of fully funding the policy in the years ahead, leaving counties to cover the cost.

“If this isn’t funded, we’re either going to be sending a large unfunded mandate to our counties, or we’re making a promise to 2.1 million people that will not be fulfilled without any funding,” he said.

Gordon-Booth detailed a three year “implementation ramp,” which would give the state time to identify funding sources for the local circuit clerks. She also said the Illinois State Police would absorb the initial costs and emphasized the state’s commitment to supporting circuit clerks in the rollout phase.

“It is our full intention to provide clerks with all that they need to implement this,” she said. “We are not going to send an unfunded mandate to our local governments.”

‘Workforce and economic policy’

On April 10, nearly 300 members, supporters and advocates from Live Free Illinois chapters gathered in front of the Abraham Lincoln monument in Springfield for Advocacy Day, calling on lawmakers to introduce the Clean Slate Act.

Live Free Illinois — a faith-based nonprofit focused on ending gun violence and mass incarceration — organizes Black congregations to push for systemic change. The organization is involved in the broad-based Clean Slate steering committee, which also includes the Fully Free Campaign, the Illinois Coalition to End Permanent Punishments, and Impact for Equity.

The day before, Muslim leaders also advocated for Clean Slate legislation at Illinois Muslim Action Day.

Beyond criminal justice reform, advocates pushed a new messaging angle this year to usher the legislation across the finish line: Clean Slate could boost Illinois’ economy.

As of April, Illinois has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, at 4.8% — above the national average of 4.2%, according to the data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Jerika Richardson, senior vice president for equitable justice and strategic initiatives at the National Urban League, said the act would open doors for thousands of people who have been barred from work because of background checks.

“There are so many employers and businesses across this country who are struggling to find the workers that they need, and part of the reason is because these records are barriers,” Richardson said. “If Illinois passes the Clean Slate Act, you won't have to worry about businesses going to another state or leaving the country.”

An amendment to the Illinois Human Rights Act, signed by Gov. JB Pritzker in 2021, expanded legal protections for state workers by prohibiting discrimination based on criminal convictions, in addition to arrest records. Yet many say they continue to face employment hurdles despite the law.

People with conviction histories earn an average of 25% less than those with clean records — a gap the National Urban League says costs the state billions of dollars in lost wages. According to a news release from the National Urban League, the Clean Slate Act could generate more than $4.7 billion in lost wages for Illinois, easing economic disparities and addressing labor shortages.

Gordon-Booth echoed Richardson’s point, adding that her office frequently hears from constituents who are missing out on life-changing chances.

“I get calls from people saying, ‘I had an opportunity to get my dream job, and it fell through because of something that I did when I was 18 or 19.’ And we're talking about folks that are in their 30s,” Gordon-Booth said. “They have not gone through the process of hiring a lawyer, going through the court-mandated process, and folks are losing out.”

(Photos courtesy of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana)LINCOLN — Lawmakers approved the governor’s two appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission on Friday over opposition from long-term advocates that the new members could delay or derail the rollout of the voter-approved medicine.
In separate votes, the Legislature approved the six-year commission appointments of Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, prevention director for Heartland Family Service. 
Oldenburg’s confirmation vote was 34-11. Mueting’s was 27-16. 
Committee advances Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission appointees

The two appointees needed at least 25 votes to be confirmed. Had one or both been rejected, Gov. Jim Pillen could still appoint someone else in the interim, without a legislative vote until 2026, or the same person if he chose.
Much of Friday’s debate on the confirmations, about 30 minutes for each nominee, revolved around whether the personal views of each woman could be separated from their new professional roles. For multiple years, Mueting and Oldenburg have opposed medical cannabis legislation at the State Capitol, including Mueting earlier this year.
Those legislative efforts were often supported by Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana and other long-time advocates who, in November, succeeded after a decade of pushing to legalize and regulate the medicine, often facing pushback from top state officials.
Appointee support and positions
The 71% voter approval for legalization and 67% for regulations also created the new state regulatory commission that Mueting and Oldenburg will now join. They will serve with the three commissioners on the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, per the ballot measure.
Those commissioners are Bruce Bailey of Lincoln and Kim Lowe of Kearney, with one vacancy still to be filled by Pillen to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.

State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, the chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee that advanced Oldenburg 5-2 and Mueting 5-3, called the two candidates highly qualified.
He said Oldenburg’s extensive experience, combined with deep concern for the health, safety and overall well-being of Nebraskans through her 18 years of medical service, would shine. Holdcroft added that Mueting had a strong record of promoting public health issues while thoughtfully balancing public health goals with public safety considerations.
Multiple senators, including State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, said the two would make a great team and keep Nebraska focused on medicine, not recreational marijuana.
“I honestly don’t know of two better people to be on this board,” Storm said Friday.
Mueting had said last week that her goal as a prevention specialist for 24 years has been to prevent people from having substance use problems and that she’s looked at medical cannabis from a “360-degree view.”
“Helping to guide the rulemaking process around the needs of the people it’s intended to serve is my goal,” Mueting said. “There’s nothing about that goal that says we need to sacrifice public health and safety to attain it.”

Oldenburg said last week that she is “not a prohibitionist” of cannabis but is “pro-research.” She said cannabis has “a place in pain management” for certain ailments that cause suffering.
“Nebraska needs to seize the opportunity to be slow and deliberate in the manner in which we determine how best to designate appropriate conditions for medical cannabis and regulate those entities that will dispense medical cannabis in our state,” Oldenburg said. “I look forward to working with various parties to ensure that we in the State of Nebraska get this right.”
‘It’s about trust’
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who like Storm is a Republican, opposed Mueting but supported Oldenburg. Hansen brought Legislative Bill 677 earlier this year to set clearer medical cannabis regulations and guardrails with the backing of volunteers from the 2024 campaign.
LB 677 fell 10 votes short of advancing on May 20, the opposition of which Storm led. Mueting testified against the bill in March.
Hansen said he was concerned about Mueting’s impartiality and that lawmakers shouldn’t appoint someone who believes in prohibition to the Liquor Control Commission or someone who works for PETA to the Nebraska Brand Committee.

He said the same goes for someone to the Medical Cannabis Commission who “denies the legitimacy of medical cannabis to the very body tasked with implementing this regulation.”
“This isn’t just about professional qualifications,” Hansen said. “It’s about trust. Trust in the will of the voters. Trust in the integrity of this new commission and trust that we are putting the right people in place to carry out a law passed and overwhelmingly supported.”
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, vice chair of the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, said that while both Mueting and Oldenburg might be nice people, he was worried about “artificial hurdles.” He supported LB 677 partly because it would have set a path toward “access.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission is charged “exclusively” with the power to regulate the control of the possession, manufacture, distribution, delivery and dispensing of cannabis for medical purposes in the state. Rules and regulations for medical cannabis dispensaries are due July 1 under the voter-approved laws. Licensing is supposed to begin by Oct. 1.
LB 677 supporters and other advocates had voiced concerns that the Medical Cannabis Commission could craft regulations that prevent meaningful “access.”
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers has already vowed to sue the commission if it issues any medical cannabis licenses. He argues it is against federal law.
‘Slow-roll access for patients’
Hansen said the public is paying attention, noting that the remaining dozens of gubernatorial appointments that lawmakers considered over the past five months, lawmakers had received 21 online comments.

But for Mueting and Oldenburg combined, lawmakers had 208 online comments, Hansen said.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, said the Legislature again threw a “wrench” in the will of Nebraska voters. She criticized senators who used the ballot measures as a reason to oppose Hansen’s LB 677 but then voted to confirm appointees who “will slow-roll access for patients in this state.”
Eggers said the mission continues to be on patients, as it has been “from day one,” despite what some legislative opponents say.
“The representatives in the state that have misrepresented our mission will see their day where the people hold them accountable. Mark our words,” Eggers said in a statement. “The patients of this state may be weary, may be tired, but they stand strong and will hold lawmakers accountable for their votes. They have the blood of Nebraskans on their hands.”

Speaking at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Plant in West Mifflin, a week after he announced the partnership with Japan’s Nippon Steel, Trump criticized the Biden administration for relaxing steel industry protections in 2021.
“The exemptions that they gave allowed foreign competitors that come in and steal our industry, steal our jobs and bring them back home and bring them home by the boatload,” Trump said standing in front of steel mill workers in orange, reflective coveralls and hard hats. Some held signs reading “Make U.S.S. Great Again.”
Trump said the 25% tariff on foreign steel he reinstated at the start of his second term would increase to 50% to “even further secure the steel industry in the United States.”
“Nobody is going to get around that,” he said.

Nippon began courting U.S. Steel in December 2023 with a $14.9 billion offer, which was approved by shareholders. Political opposition to the sale centered on the national security implications of selling one of America’s largest steel companies to a foreign corporation. The deal was stranded for most of last year as President Joe Biden awaited a recommendation from the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States.
Like Biden, Trump also initially opposed the sale, but announced May 23 in a post on Truth Social that the deal was back on. He described it as a “planned partnership” between the Japanese and American companies that would bring $14 billion of investment in a matter of months. 
The domestic steel and aluminum industries have long been a focus of Trump’s trade policy. He reintroduced the 25% tariff on imports of the metals even before he announced his broad duties on products made overseas that he said would bring manufacturing back to American shores. 
“When I came into office eight years ago, I proclaimed a simple but truly important principle, if you don’t have steel, you don’t have a country,” Trump said. “A strong steel industry is not just a matter of dignity or prosperity and pride, it’s above all, a matter of national security.”
In his hour-long speech, Trump also touched on his administration’s immigration policy and recognized Pennsylvania elected officials in the audience, including Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District), a likely GOP candidate for governor next year.
“If you run, you’ve got my support,” Trump said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump’s remarks, however, focused on the long-delayed merger but provided few additional details for anxious investors. Nippon and U.S. Steel have not officially disclosed terms of the rumored transaction. Earlier this week, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) said the merger would be subject to a “national security agreement” under which the U.S. government would appoint some of the company’s directors.
Trump, instead, highlighted how he said it would benefit the Monongahela River Valley, where three of U.S. Steel’s plants employ nearly 4,000 workers. 
Nippon would invest $2.2 billion to increase production in the Mon Valley Works and $200 million in the company’s Advanced Technology Research and Development Center in nearby Munhall.
The post-merger U.S. Steel would also maintain all of its currently operating blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. “We have that as a commitment,” Trump said.
And Trump promised there would be no outsourcing work or layoffs and that every U.S. Steel worker would receive a $5,000 bonus. 
“You’ve gone through a lot, it’s closing. It’s not closing,” Trump said to the crowd.
He brought several union leaders to the microphone, including Jason Zugai, vice president of USW Local 2227, and a third-generation steelworker. Zugal thanked elected officials including McCormick, Mueser and state Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Dauphin) for their concern as the sale took shape. 
“These investments are life changing for all the men and women here today and for our communities,” Zugai said. 
USW International President David McCall said in a statement Friday evening that the union remains concerned about the effects the merger will have on national security, its members and the communities where they work.
“We have not participated in the discussions involving U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel, and the Trump administration, nor were we consulted, so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the ‘planned partnership’ between USS and Nippon or the ‘golden share’ that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government,” McCall said.
McCall said the union’s only concerns are the long-term viability and sustainability of the current U.S. Steel facilities to safeguard the employment and retirement security of its members. So far, he said, the union has seen only public relations and not commitments in writing.
“Issuing press releases and making political speeches is easy. Binding commitments are hard,” McCall said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative effort backed by Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers to ban most consumable hemp and other THC products in the state stalled Friday and will now wait until at least 2026.
State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, sponsor of Legislative Bill 316, asked that her Legislative Bill 316 be “passed over” on Friday. She waited to do so until just 10 minutes before a two-hour debate would have ended, a time when Kauth would have needed 33 votes to survive a filibuster. After that, she would have needed 25 votes to pass LB 316 and send it to Gov. Jim Pillen.
Kauth had the backing of most of the officially nonpartisan Legislature’s 33 Republicans. But Republican State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair held to his promise to oppose LB 316 if it wasn’t amended to explicitly protect medical cannabis products.
Medical cannabis
Kauth tried to address Hansen’s concerns and would have, said Hansen. But lawmakers ran out of time, because State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha and other opponents successfully blocked LB 316 from being amended.

Hilgers has argued that THC products with delta-8 are already illegal, to which Cavanaugh said Friday that if that’s true, a bill isn’t needed.
Hansen said the current “environment” with Hilgers, who has opposed medical cannabis and has launched a statewide campaign against delta-8, could be “hostile.” Hansen said there was language in LB 316 that could “greatly impact” medical cannabis.
“That’s something I cannot have,” Hansen said. “I think the people passed [medical cannabis] for a specific reason, and I think they are then due to have what they voted for.”
Hilgers helped lead opposition to Hansen’s proposal for clearer medical cannabis regulations and guardrails with 53 sheriffs. His LB 677 fell short 10 votes of advancing on May 20.
Part of Friday’s last-ditch effort featured pressure on State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, who said she was concerned about “bad actors” in the THC arena but didn’t want to take away the health products some Nebraskans rely on.

Raybould echoed Hansen that lawmakers should allow a new medical cannabis regulatory commission to proceed with directives for those products.
Kauth said multiple times during the debate that her bill had nothing to do with medical cannabis and that more than a dozen amendments from Cavanaugh made it “impossible” to seek the changes needed to keep her bill moving forward.
“No one is going into anyone’s homes and searching their medicine cabinets,” Kauth said. “That is more hyperbole and hysteria from the left.”
Health and safety
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who prioritized Kauth’s LB 316 for this year’s session, encouraged Nebraskans not to buy the “garbage” products. He repeated that he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.”
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of any concentration and with processed hemp prohibit the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for some hemp-based products such as fibers and textiles.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
If the bill passed, it would have included a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” as newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would have faced an additional 10% wholesale tax at the time of purchase.
The new excise tax revenue raised would have been directed toward property tax relief.
Besides protecting the voter-approved medical cannabis laws, Kauth also worked with State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth to offer an “affirmative defense” in court if someone could prove they previously legally purchased what would have become “illegal hemp” under LB 316. That could include a receipt.
‘Good’ and ‘bad’ actors
State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, a Republican who represents a Pleasanton-based hemp company that has offered tours to state senators of its facilities, said there are good actors that lawmakers should be working with.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings, a close ally of McKeon, said there are no “good actors.”
Nebraska lawmakers again advance ban of most THC, consumable hemp products

Kauth read a letter from Hilgers that had said if LB 316 passed, his office would have announced a pause on new civil enforcement actions against “businesses operating in good faith” for at least 120 days, exactly through the end of 2025. Kauth declined to provide a copy of the letter because LB 316 did not pass.
Kauth and Storm said they now hope Hilgers ramps up his legal efforts against THC stores. 
Many hemp-focused businesses said the broad language in LB 316 would shut down their industry, even as supporters said the bill wouldn’t touch them. Kauth said Friday that some businesses that were fighting the changes are essentially “admitting that they are selling dangerous, untested, unregulated, synthetic pot products.”
“They are pushing the health and well-being of their pocketbook above the health and well-being of Nebraskans,” Kauth said. “I’m extraordinarily disappointed that that is where we have come.”
‘We’re not people’s parents’
Cavanaugh, who again led opposition to the bill, said regulations and not a ban were still the best path forward. He said LB 316 would go in the “opposite direction” of economic development for budding businesses who are “good actors.”
His LB 16, to implement regulations on THC products, did not advance from the Judiciary Committee this year, and lawmakers repeatedly rebuffed his efforts.

Cavanaugh repeated Friday that he is “ready, willing and able to work on a regulatory scheme that will actually do this the right way and answer all the concerns that people have.”
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also pushed for regulations, said Kauth’s bill could cause more harm than good and that the state should let people be adults.
“Why do we have to act as if we’re the moral compass for the state? We’re senators. We’re not people’s parents,” said McKinney.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha said she had purchased CBD with hemp in it for her nearly 101-year-old mother, but she didn’t have a receipt for the product.
Cavanaugh said the proposed defense provision only dealt with individuals, so businesses would have needed to destroy or sell all products by September, when the bill, if passed, would have taken effect. If not, business owners would risk “countless felonies,” Cavanaugh argued.
What would be banned?
The debate on LB 316 has seen senators forcefully disagree with what would be banned, with supporters arguing it would only ban “synthetic” chemically modified hemp or THC, while opponents said the bill would stretch to CBD, creams, ointments and most other products.
Part of that is because LB 316 would count the THC level based on all concentrations — delta-8, delta-9, delta-10, etc. — and not just 0.3% delta-9 THCc. Cavanaugh and State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha have said that it could criminalize possessing a gummy as a felony.

Supporters of LB 316, however, say that only chemically modified “synthetic” products would be banned.
Nebraska lawmakers in 2011 already banned “synthetic” marijuana, such as K-2 or spice. Most hemp or other hemp-derived products require chemical modifications, such as heat.
‘We could have stopped it’
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said that while, as a conservative, she doesn’t think government should be in the way of business or entrepreneurship, government does have a role to protect people “from things that they couldn’t otherwise do for themselves independently.”
“Individuals do not have the capacity to know the processes that go into developing a product. That’s what we have things like the FDA for,” Storer said, referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Cavanaugh, McKinney, Raybould and State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln repeatedly said that was part of the reason why regulations, not a ban, would be better, treating the products similarly to alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
Kauth said that with lawmakers’ failure to move forward, senators must own that the next time someone dies because of the products, they will know: “We could have stopped it.”
LB 316 will return next year one vote away from passing, with eight minutes to go in the third round of debate, though it’s unclear what amendments might come. Rescheduling would be up to Speaker John Arch of La Vista.

[…]","Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin leads a meeting of the DNC Executive Committee in Little Rock on May 30, 2025. (Screen grab from livestream)Ahead of a meeting of the Democratic National Committee’s Executive Committee in Little Rock on Friday, DNC chair Ken Martin said the national party is committing the largest financial assistance to state Democratic parties ever.
“The DNC will push out over a million dollars every month to the state parties,” Martin said in an interview. That includes $22,500 a month to the Arkansas Democratic Party to help it mobilize its efforts to improve the party’s position in the Natural State, he said.
“Arkansas is one of the only states where we saw legislative gains (in 2024),” he said. Democrats gained a single seat in the 100-member Arkansas House in the state’s only majority-Latino district last year.
 “There’s real opportunity for us, but that means we have to take advantage of it. Arkansas is really an important part of the calculus of how we build our future,” Martin said.
Little Rock was a hub of Democratic Party activity this week. The Association of State Democratic Committees met Wednesday and Thursday, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The DNC Executive Committee met Friday at the Doubletree Hotel on Markham. 



 
At Friday’s meeting, Martin talked about steps he’s taking to make the party more transparent and democratic in the wake of Kamala Harris’ loss to Donald Trump and the election of a narrow Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. He also presented lists of his nominees for various party committees that will be voted on when the DNC meets in August.
Martin’s remarks in the meeting echoed his comments in an interview with the Arkansas Advocate Friday morning.
He acknowledged that Democrats are not popular with many voters and that the party faces a crisis.
“People don’t have faith and trust in the party,” he said.
Asked what will change people’s minds, Martin cited Missouri, where measures on paid family leave, minimum wage and abortion protections were on last year’s ballot.
“All of them passed overwhelmingly… Those same voters went down the ticket and voted for Trump and independents. So clearly, the policies that we support as Democrats are wildly popular throughout the country. What isn’t popular is the Democratic Party … so for us, when we talk to voters and make an appeal to them, we need to talk to them about the issues that they already know will make a material difference in the lives of their families and communities,” he said.
He also said party leaders need to change their Washington, D.C.-oriented mindset. 
“We have to actually understand that some of these areas that we’ve lost over time are because we didn’t make the investment of time, energy and money. We stopped organizing. We stopped working in places like Arkansas in a meaningful way. As a result they become red,” Martin said.
“We didn’t come here just because Little Rock is beautiful. We came to send a message,” he said. “I’ve watched Arkansas change over the years, and I know we can change it again.”
He said he’s focused on rebuilding the party infrastructure, especially in Republican-controlled states like Arkansas. He noted that political power in the U.S. is shifting to the South, where six of the 10 fastest-growing states are.
“If we don’t lay down a foundation here, we won’t be prepared to meet that moment when it comes upon us. I don’t want to be caught flatfooted when the map shifts. If we do get caught flatfooted, we could be in a permanent minority for a long time.”
He cited research that showed public perceptions of the two political parties have changed. 
“A majority of Americans now believe that the Republican Party best represents the interests of the working class and poor and the Democratic Party is the party of the wealthy and elites. Just to prove the point, the only two groups we overperformed with in the presidential campaign were college-educated voters and wealthy households.
“That’s not sustainable,” the DNC chair said.
Democrats need to focus on an economic agenda that gives people some hope that better days are in front of them not behind them, he said. 
“It’s about focusing on an agenda that will give people a sense that we see them, we hear them and we’ve got some ideas on how we can actually improve your lives,” he added. “We have to give them a sense that we give a damn about them and their families and we’re going to fight for them.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ken-Martin-at-DNC-Exec-mtg-1024x576.png,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

As of early Friday evening, negotiators were still at work putting the finishing touches on Senate Bill 4, a sprawling piece of legislation that lawmakers hope will offer between $250 million and $500 million in direct savings to ratepayers by borrowing money to pay off portions of the public benefits charge on people’s bills.
But while members of both parties are in broad agreement on the need for legislation to lower prices, a debate over one provision of the bill, which addresses the powers of Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, has threatened to upend the precarious negotiations.
Republicans are demanding that Democratic leaders and the governor’s office, who are hammering out the bill’s language, alter a section of the bill they argue would concentrate more power with PURA’s leader, Marissa Gillett. As the session hurtles toward its constitutional deadline next Wednesday, their power to filibuster and ultimately block legislation only grows.
“I’d like to see something that is actually going to reduce energy costs,” House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, told reporters Friday. “I’m hopeful we’re going to get there but I’m not going to back down.”
The section in question first appeared in a draft of the bill that was circulated around the state Capitol last week. It would allow Gillett or her successor to assign a hearing officer to rule on “procedural, evidentiary and intermediate matters” in cases that appear before utility regulators.
Critics quickly noted that the language appears to touch on an issue that’s the subject of a lawsuit filed in January by the state’s two utility companies, Eversource and Avangrid. The lawsuit alleged Gillett has made herself, in essence, a hearing officer, issuing unilateral decisions in hundreds of matters dating back to 2020. In court filings, attorneys for the agency have rebutted those claims and argued Gillett has revised longstanding practices to provide for more input from her fellow commissioners.
The original text in the draft bill would have made the hearing officer language effective retroactive to Jan. 1, 2025 — before the lawsuit was filed — prompting Candelora to accuse Gillett of interfering in the bill-drafting process to give herself cover from the litigation.
Candelora said the objectionable language was initially was dropped from newer versions of the bill after concerns were raised last week, only to reemerge in recent days.
A spokeswoman for PURA said Gillett was presiding over a rate case on Friday and was not immediately available for comment. 
One of the key drafters of the legislation, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said the section of the bill in question originated from an effort by House members to address the ongoing dispute over administrative procedures between PURA and the utilities. Since then, the co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee said it’s become a headache he’d rather not deal with.
“My position on this from the very beginning was even talking about this issue — which was a House ask to clarify procedure — even talking about it while there’s an ongoing lawsuit, is a bad idea,” Needleman said. 
Still, Needleman said the section remained a point of contention Friday and was one of the last remaining issues that needed to be resolved before lawmakers could read and vote on the bill. With the Senate planning to break for the weekend, the soonest a vote could happen is Monday. 
“I’m out of time,” Needleman said. “I don’t have a lot of negotiating space, I can’t drag this out.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told reporters earlier Friday that the bill would need to have bipartisan support in order to make it through the House next week due to the dwindling amount of time left in the session and his desire to maintain what is a strong working relationship with Candelora, the Republican leader.
When asked about the origins of the language dealing with PURA, Ritter confirmed Needleman’s account that the section originated in the House with both Republican and Democratic support. However, he said it evolved beyond their initial idea after going through a comment process that involved members of Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, PURA and the Office of Consumer Counsel, among others.
Ritter said he also agreed with Needleman that the retroactive date in the language was made in error, and that it would be corrected in the final version of the bill.
“It was not a conspiracy,” Ritter said. “The original concept comes from the House, and we’re going to try to get it right, because it’s a big part of the bill.”
Candelora, meanwhile, said he would like to see the bill include language that would require any matter before PURA to be assigned to a panel of commissioners, who could then vote to appoint their own “presiding officer,” rather than leaving that decision up to the chair. He also reiterated his desire to have Lamont fill a pair of vacancies that have existed since the lawmakers expanded the number of PURA commissioners from three to five in 2019.
“There’s still a fundamental struggle with how much authority to give the chairman of PURA versus having the commission act as a panel,” Candelora said. 
Ritter said he shared Candelora’s concerns and remained hopeful that the two chambers could work out a compromise. Needleman, meanwhile, said he’s asked the Attorney General’s office to weigh in on the latest draft of the bill to ensure that any language dealing with PURA’s procedures does not interfere with ongoing litigation.
A spokeswoman for Attorney General William Tong said Friday afternoon the office was still waiting to see the latest language in the bill.
If either Tong’s office or members of the House object to that language, Needleman said he’s prepared to strip the section out of the bill altogether in hopes of getting to a final agreement. 
“Here’s the bottom line: This bill is about saving money. I’m trying to get to the maximum amount of savings for ratepayers,” Needleman said. “All the other stuff is superfluous.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0123_SR_PressConferences491-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

Street takeovers
On its second try, the House of Representatives passed a bill allowing municipalities to create regulations prohibiting street takeovers.
Debate over the bill was paused last week when Republicans brought up concerns about a part of the bill allowing municipalities to destroy ATVs and dirt-bikes that were seized by the police after violating municipal ordinances if the owner does not claim the vehicles within 30 days.
The amended bill increases the 30 days to 90, assuaging concerns that vehicle owners might not be able to locate an ATV within 30 days if the vehicle was stolen.
It also changes the penalty for multiple counts of participation in a street takeover from license forfeiture to a two-year license revocation and a $2,000 penalty.
Rep. Gale Mastrofrancesco, R-Wolcott, one of four people who opposed the bill, said she was still concerned about a portion prohibiting people from gathering to observe a street takeover.
“My concern is that you see something going on in your neighborhood, in the area, and you’re curious … they can be fined for that. We can’t prohibit people from coming out of their houses and observing anything,” she said.
But Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, said the municipality would have to prove that the person gathered in the area for the purpose of watching the street takeover in order to enforce that.
The bill passed 144-4.

Sunday hunting
A bill to allow Sunday hunting on private lands advanced out of the House on Wednesday, despite the opposition of many in the majority party.
Hunters have spent years pushing to end restrictions on Sunday hunting, which critics have described as one of Connecticut’s last remaining “blue laws.” In 2015, lawmakers voted to allow a limited exception for bow hunting.
House Bill 7231 would go further, allowing Sunday hunting with firearms on private properties of at least 10 acres.
“We’ve talked about the concept for a little while… this year we’re taking a strong next step,” said state Rep. John-Michael Parker, D-Madison, the co-chair of the Environment Committee.
Opponents, however, argued that hunting would disrupt the activities of hikers and others who seek to get outdoors on Sundays. An amendment added to the bill just prior to Wednesday’s vote attempted to ease those concerns by restricting hunting within 40 yards of a blue-blazed hiking trail, even on private lands.
Still, the bill created divisions within the Democratic caucus.
“I am not satisfied, many of the people who testified over the years in front of the Environment Committee are not going to be satisfied with this 40-yard designation,” said state Rep. Mike Demicco, D-Farmington.
The House voted 101 to 45 to advance the bill on Wednesday, with all of the opposition coming from Democrats. It now heads to the Senate for further consideration.

Most of Connecticut’s congressional delegation signed a letter urging the Appropriations Committee to continue funding the Emergency Voucher program, which helps thousands of people across the country pay for their housing, according to a news release sent Friday.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced earlier this year that it would discontinue the program, which offers rental aid to families experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. The department cited rising rents as the reason the program was becoming untenable.
“The EHV program provides rental assistance to help end and prevent homelessness,” the letter said. “At a time when housing costs and homelessness continue to rise, we respectfully request that you provide adequate funding in the FY26 THUD Appropriations bill to renew all EHVs to ensure that those who have been served by the program do not lose their housing support and to ensure landlords continue receiving the rental payments they depend on to maintain their properties.”
The program serves about 107,000 people across the country.
Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal signed the bill, as did Reps. Jim Himes, Jahana Hayes, Joe Courtney and John Larson.

HUSKY delivery
A bill that would ensure that the legislature is part of any change to the Medicaid delivery model passed through the Senate on Friday afternoon. Senate Bill 985 requires the commissioner of the Department of Social Services to submit any plans to change the payment model for Medicaid, called HUSKY in Connecticut, to legislative committees. Currently, the executive branch has authority to make such a change, through DSS.
Gov. Ned Lamont previously commissioned a study to investigate whether returning to a managed care Medicaid model would be more cost efficient. Even studying the possibility of a switch was met with fierce opposition. The resulting report found that Connecticut’s current system — a managed fee-for-service model — boasts lower costs and similar levels of access when compared to peer states. S.B. 985 is designed to ensure that lawmakers would have a say if the subject returns to the table in the future.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, D-Middletown, who is the co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said there is no issue that has attracted more interest across the nation this year than Medicaid.
“There are massive changes happening at the federal level, changes that we’re certainly concerned about in this building. And the question is, when considering major changes or changes to the HUSKY Health Program, should the legislature be at the table? And this bill seeks to make sure that it is.”

,DC,2025-05-30 23:09:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump sends detailed budget request cutting spending by $163 billion to Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-sends-detailed-budget-request-cutting-spending-163-billion-congress,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration released significantly more detail about its budget request Friday evening, giving Congress the information it needs for lawmakers to draft the annual government funding bills.The 1,224-page document sheds light on where exactly President Donald Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought want lawmakers to cut federal spending during the upcoming fiscal year.The Office of Management and Budget released a “skinny” version of the annual proposal in early May, requesting lawmakers cut domestic spending by $163 billion and keep funding for defense programs flat in the dozen annual appropriations bills.While the documents in that request provided some insight into how Trump wants to reshape the size and scope of about $1.7 trillion in discretionary funding, which is spending that Congress directs, they didn’t include the level of detail that the Appropriations committees need to begin their work.The appendix document released Friday should aid in that, though it does not represent a full budget request. That type of proposal would include the White House’s goals for mandatory programs, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, which make up about two-thirds of federal spending. Such spending is required by law and is not subject to annual appropriations.A full budget request also typically includes tax policy proposals, though with Republicans in Congress already working to enact an extension of the 2017 GOP tax law in the “big, beautiful bill,” those sections would likely be of little use to lawmakers at this point.Work on spending bills launchingThe House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to release and debate its 12 government funding bills throughout June, before voting to send those measures to the floor.Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., will likely include funding levels and policy closely aligned with the White House request, since legislation in that chamber can pass a floor vote with a simple majoritySenate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, has a more challenging task, since regular bills in that chamber require bipartisanship to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster. Republicans control the Senate with 53 members.In general, that means the Senate panel’s bills tend to look much more like the final version that becomes law than the House bills, though not always. Both chambers are supposed to reach a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the dozen bills before the start of the next fiscal year on Oct. 1, but that rarely happens.Congress is much more likely to use a stopgap spending bill until mid-December to give members more time to negotiate funding levels and policies on thousands of government programs.The House and Senate were unable to reach agreement for this fiscal year, and instead leaned on a series of three continuing resolutions to keep the government up and running.Partial shutdown could loom againTensions over the proposed funding cuts in Trump’s first budget request of his second term could reach a boiling point if Cole, Collins, House ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate ranking member Patty Murray cannot broker an agreement before their deadline.Failure to enact some sort of government funding legislation — either the dozen full-year bills, or a stopgap spending measure — would lead to a partial government shutdown. Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Friday evening that it was “telling that President Trump has chosen to release his budget on a Friday night with no fanfare whatsoever.”“This is a draconian proposal to hurt working people and our economy, and it is dead on arrival in Congress as long as I have anything to say about it,” Murray wrote. “But this is just another reminder we need Republicans to join us to reject these reckless cuts, focus on the investments we actually need to make in our communities and security, and to finally force Trump to follow the law and end his devastating funding freeze.”DeLauro wrote in a statement that the ""government envisioned by President Trump only serves billionaires and the biggest corporations and would do nothing to lower the cost of living.”“This is not a complete budget,"" she wrote. ""We are supposed to start putting together the funding bills for 2026 next week. If, as expected, House Republicans follow what President Trump has proposed so far, it is not a serious effort to deliver for the American people.”",,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

The list was compiled in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide.

Photo courtesy of the Education Justice Coalition of VermontThe entire state of Vermont and three of its cities are listed on a new Department of Homeland Security list identifying so-called sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States — but Vermont officials say their policies adhere to federal immigration laws and help build trust with and reassure immigrants.Released Thursday night, the list of more than 500 cities and states identified as sanctuary cities, schools or states are seen by the Trump administration as “defying federal immigration law,” according to a Department of Homeland Security press release.“Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal illegal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in grave danger,” and the department is “committed to exposing these lawless jurisdictions to the public and making them accountable for not respecting the rule of law,” the release stated.The list was compiled in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide that are “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The Trump administration has threatened to suspend or end federal funds to those schools, cities or states.While Vermont has not declared itself as a sanctuary state, it “maintains full compliance with federal law while protecting the Constitutional rights of citizens and the State,” Amanda Wheeler, Gov. Phil Scott’s spokesperson, wrote in a Friday email. “This means, Vermont doesn’t stand in the way of the federal government carrying out federal immigration laws in Vermont,” she wrote.After considerable delays and pressure from immigrant advocacy groups, the state last year updated its fair and impartial policing policy that aims to reduce bias based on citizenship status.READ MORE
The governor in 2017, however, signed legislation days after then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to revoke law enforcement funding from sanctuary cities and states that block police from telling federal authorities about unauthorized immigrants in their custody.The 2017 guidelines provide an outline for municipalities to consider when adopting policies on municipal law enforcement interactions with federal immigration officials. A fact sheet put out by Scott further stresses “Vermont’s response does not put federal dollars at risk because it does not establish Vermont as a ‘sanctuary jurisdiction.’”After families and staff in Vermont’s most diverse school district strongly advocated for the measure, the Winooski School District in February became the first in Vermont to pass a sanctuary school policy that remains active and compliant with existing law, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria.Winooski “continues to abide by its policy to affirmatively protect the rights of students and families regardless of their immigration status and to take proactive measures to educate our community of those rights,” he wrote in an email Friday. “Our policies and procedures are respectful of the law and while we monitor ‘demands’ from the Trump administration, we will be ready to comply only when those demands have a sufficient legal basis. As of this moment, our policy remains within the law,” Chavarria added.The Department of Homeland Security release contained no details, but local authorities believe the administration will target policies that restrict federal immigration authorities from accessing property and information. This could apply to existing sanctuary city or school guidelines as well as fair and impartial policing guidelines in Vermont.Montpelier and Burlington have both in place.Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said Friday the city’s fair and impartial policing policy, aimed at preventing discrimination in law enforcement and preventing officers from enforcing civil immigration law, does not violate federal law and is needed “to keep our community safe.”Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak on Friday, April 4. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“Burlington, like other communities identified as sanctuary jurisdictions, has a proud history of welcoming immigrants and refugees,” she said in a press release issued Friday afternoon. “We will not back down from ensuring the safety of all who live, work and visit our community.”Such policies help build trust between immigrant communities and police departments and ensure “people can call for help without fear of discrimination based on immigration status,” Mulvaney-Stanak added. The Burlington School District has not declared itself a sanctuary school, but it did issue guidelines regarding federal immigration efforts to staff in January and partnered with local agencies to educate new American families about their rights. Superintendent Tom Flanagan said he is concerned about the Homeland Security directive. He is not sharing details about the agencies the district has partnered with to help immigrant families in order to protect them.“Thankfully, no deportations have occurred in schools or on school grounds. We continue to work closely with families and community partners to make sure they feel safe and understand their rights,” he said in an emailed statement Friday. “Families and staff understand that we cannot keep anyone 100% safe from illegal deportation and they have told us they are grateful for the steps we have and continue to take.”“We also believe we continue to do what is morally right and that we are operating in a way that complies with federal and state law,” he wrote.Montpelier adopted its sanctuary city resolution in 2016 affirming that local law enforcement willnot enforce federal immigration policy at the request of the federal government. The capital has also adopted a fair and impartial policing policy modeled after the state policy that makes clear “enforcement of civil immigration law is a federal responsibility, and establishes that the Montpelier Police Department (MPD) shall not engage in such enforcement,” City Manager Bill Fraser said in a Friday press release.The Homeland Security release claiming sanctuary jurisdictions “protect violent criminal illegal aliens” comes a day after the second large-scale immigration enforcement incident in Vermont in just two months.Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials detained 10 people in the town of Newport Thursday after they finished work at a construction site nearby. Some were carrying proof of their immigration status and are being scheduled for release. The status of the other detainees is not yet clear.Last month, ICE detained nine migrant workers at a dairy farm in Berkshire, four of whom have already been deported to Mexico. Three others were released Friday, according to a press release from Migrant Justice.READ MORE
Molly Gray, executive director of the Burlington-based nonprofit Afghan Alliance, wrote in an email that the sanctuary list is intended to “intimidate Vermonters through fear and coercion.”“This administration may be comfortable with violating due process, and unlawfully targeting immigrants and refugees but Vermonters are not and won’t have any part in it. This Administration might abandon its promise and responsibility to Afghan Allies, but Vermonters will not,” she wrote.The Homeland Security release is “another attempt from the federal government to force private and public institutions into “voluntarily” changing their conduct, policies, or practices—even when institutions’ rights and responsibilities, and the law, have not actually changed,” Falko Schilling, advocacy director of the ACLU of Vermont, said in an emailed statement.Presidential executive orders cannot change laws, Schilling said. He said the Trump administration is “trying to use its executive power to pressure institutions into pre-emptive compliance with its policy goals in an end run around not only Congress, but the autonomy of individual states.”Some states and advocacy groups across the country have been challenging presidential orders, arguing they are unconstitutional, particularly around immigration as the Trump administration carries out a promise to ramp up mass deportations.A federal court in Vermont has played a central role, most recently helping to free detained Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi and pause the transfer of detained student Rümeysa Öztürk.Students at Champlain Valley Union High School last week staged a “hands off” walkout in protest of the impact of the federal government’s immigration enforcement policies. An early suspension of a parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans led two Nicaraguan students to leave the country by the end of April.“We’ve heard from students, educators, and community members, students can’t learn if they don’t feel safe. No student should have to fear for their friends, family, or their own safety in the presence of immigration officials, especially in a place of learning. Sanctuary school policies make schools safer for all students,” said Kayla Loving, a coordinator at the Education Justice Coalition of Vermont that helped draft a K-12 sanctuary school policy used by Winooski.This is not the first time Vermont communities have faced federal threats over their sanctuary status. In 2018, the U.S Department of Justice sent letters to 28 cities and states, including the state of Vermont and city of Burlington, warning they may not be in compliance with federal immigration law.None of the communities named in the Department of Homeland Security list had received letters as of Friday.Attorney General Charity Clark on June 18, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerVermont Attorney General Charity Clark, who continues to join other states in a growing list of legal actions challenging Trump administration actions, said this list is no surprise. She said her office is prepared and will continue to fight for the rule of law and the rights of Vermonters.“Any Vermont official who receives a notice as a result of this list should continue to follow state laws and policies, which are in compliance with federal law and designed to build the trust necessary to protect public safety,” Clark said in an emailed statement. “It’s the federal government’s responsibility to enforce immigration laws, and state and local law enforcement should remain focused on public safety in our communities.”The crackdown on immigration has many immigrant families nervous and on edge, according to Shabnam Nolan, executive director of the King Street Center, a community center that serves youth in Burlington.“We continue to hear worry, even from those with legal status, about their safety amid recent federal statements. When any statement or action — whether from institutions or individuals — casts doubt on belonging, children feel it first. We hear their questions. We see their fear. And we hold space for their hope,” Nolan said Friday.The center’s role, she said, is to provide stability and connection to every child and caregiver. “And no matter what, we will continue to play this role,” Nolan said. “We remain committed to listening deeply, responding thoughtfully, and standing alongside our families through uncertainty and beyond.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont sanctuary jurisdictions respond to Homeland Security list, say policies comply with federal law.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/champlain-valley-high-school-protest-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-30 20:04:27.043721

The footage shows that after calling 911 to report an armed burglar dressed in all black, a woman met officers at her door in that same style of clothing and pointed a handgun at them.
The post Body cam footage shows Casper homeowner raising gun at officers responding to 911 call appeared first on WyoFile .","A woman shot and killed by police in April raised a handgun in the direction of officers after meeting them at the door of her central Casper home, body camera footage released Friday by the Casper Police Department shows.
The woman called police to her own home just after midnight on April 28 on a report of an armed burglar that appears to be false.
The footage, which includes a warning that viewer discretion is advised, shows that after calling 911 to report an armed burglar dressed in all black, 37-year-old Jody Cobia met officers at the door to her home in that same style of clothing, holding a handgun. “Where the fuck are my children?” Cobia yelled as she stepped toward the officers and raised a handgun in their direction. 
Cobia is a mother of three, but did not appear to have custody of her children, according to court records previously reviewed by WyoFile. Police found no one else in the home, the video shows.
When Cobia raised the gun, officers expressed surprise and stepped back while two of them fired, according to the body camera footage released late Friday afternoon. The two officers fired five rounds over two seconds, according to narration by the department included in the footage. 
Four officers responded to the burglary report initially. After shooting Cobia, they searched the rest of the house, and did not find any evidence of an intruder. Department officials had previously told the public there was no indication that Cobia’s report of a burglar was accurate and that they believe she made the call to draw police to her home. 
After searching the home, officers and paramedics provide life-saving measures to Cobia, but the first officers to reach her say on the body camera footage that they can’t feel her pulse. Immediately after shooting Cobia, some officers moved to enter the home, but a supervisor on scene told them to wait for about 15 seconds, while he yelled into the house and tried to ascertain if anyone else was home. 
Officers take time to make sure no one else is in the house, including the possible armed burglar, and do not begin to give Cobia medical attention until around eight minutes after she was shot. 
In the audio of the 911 call, a woman, presumably Cobia, tells dispatch someone “armed and dangerous” had broken into her house. The audio of the call released Friday does not identify the caller as Cobia, but the department said she made the call in its May 7 release. 
“He’s wearing all black,” the caller says. “Please show up.” 
She repeatedly tells the dispatcher to “hurry up,” but is not whispering into the phone on the call. “He’s inside,” the caller says, “please get inside. Please get over here.” 
The caller tells the dispatcher the burglar is in a back room of the house, after previously saying she herself was in that same room. That appears to give the dispatcher pause. “And you’re in the back room?” the dispatcher asks the caller. 
“Yeah, I’m running away from him,” the caller says. She ends the call shortly after that. 
Officers arrived on scene about three minutes after the 911 call, which began one minute after midnight. Body camera footage then shows four officers approaching the house, shining flashlights along exterior walls and windows as they do so. 
When an officer nears the door, Cobia appears to open it before he can knock. The pistol police say she held is difficult to make out in the body camera footage, but she appears to be holding it down by her waist as she opens the door. She then swings it up toward the officer’s head and takes hold of it in both hands as she yells about her children. Police fire at her immediately after that. 
The incident remains under review by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation, according to the Casper Police Department. After that inquiry, the case will be sent to the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office, which will decide whether the shooting was justified.

Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, gestures across the table as House and Senate members of the education reform bill conference committee meet at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerYou couldn’t walk 10 steps under the golden dome Friday without someone asking if we were getting out of here today. Legislative lawyers are under-rested and over-extended. Lawmakers have skipped too many meals. And everyone has a pet theory — so-and-so wants a delay, someone has a secret proposal they’re waiting to unveil. But it’s not looking good, folks, thanks to the ed bill. Here’s how it was going down (so far). After a stalled morning, the H.454 conferees gathered for a brief meeting after 11. Despite an air of pessimism preceding the discussion, both sides expressed willingness to compromise on key issues that threatened to delay the day. The surprise came later. I’ll get to that. House members, for their part, signaled a willingness to consider allowing districts to spend less than the amount a foundation formula would provide in full. Senate members suggested they would consider the House’s version of a property tax credit, which would significantly expand eligibility and relief over the existing system but cost more overall. Reaching agreement looked much less likely hours later. When the group returned at 2:45 with the Senate’s latest draft, there were some new ideas. Quite a few. For example, a potential expansion of school choice. Components of a foundation formula pulled from a couple of weeks ago. And if districts can’t pass a budget by a certain date, they get 90% of a foundation formula rather than the full thing — unless they’re a fully non-operating district, in which case they don’t have to vote and get 100% of the foundation formula. As the surprises arrived, both conferees and spectators struggled to control their shock. Eyebrows raised, one lobbyist leaned to the next and mouthed, “this is wild.”The new language proliferated throughout the Senate’s proposal — but was not in the chamber’s original bill, the House’s version or the governor’s recommendations. With frustration palpable, Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, chair of the House Education Committee, called for a recess. When the group reconvened at 5 p.m., the Senators first appeared to pull their large changes off the table, before clarifying that most of it was still in play.“Do you believe passing this tonight is the right answer?” Conlon asked the Senate members, holding up the afternoon surprise. Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, appeared to nod. But Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, was less sure.“I don’t know if that is the right answer. That was 15-minute at lunch’s attempt to come up with an answer,” she said. Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, spoke up. “We had a bill that was one caucus all the way through, and now we’ve got to square it up with both caucasus and a Republican governor. So I guess, let’s dig in.”— Ethan WeinsteinOn the moveAfter several days of acrimonious debate, the House and Senate reached a deal on this year’s housing bill, S.127, on Friday afternoon. Scott administration officials indicated that the Republican governor will support it. The chambers each accepted the compromise and passed the bill by early evening.The bulk of the disagreement between the two chambers centered around a new infrastructure financing program for housing development, which would leverage the increased tax revenue from new construction to pay back loans for infrastructure like water lines, roads and sidewalks. The House had added a host of guardrails to the initiative in an effort to protect foregone property tax revenue from the Education Fund. The Senate — and the Scott administration — had pushed for fewer rules, arguing that a more flexible version of the initiative would help add more homes to the grand list and spread out the burden of rising education costs.Tensions ran high during a conference committee this week as the two sides sparred, leaving observers to wonder whether lawmakers might walk away from the negotiating table. But by Friday afternoon, they settled their differences on a few key points: they agreed to significantly raise a cap on the amount of tax-increment a state council can approve for new projects each year, and they scrapped a previously-added sunset to Vermont’s existing, larger-scale tax increment financing program.The crowded room erupted in applause when House members agreed to Senate members’ last offer.“Thank you for this step – for really creating a new tool for housing creation,” said Sen. Alison Clarkson, D-Windsor.— Carly BerlinThe House on Friday morning approved a Senate proposal to push back the effective date of a proposed cap on the cost of outpatient pharmaceutical drugs. The measure, included in H.266, was originally proposed by the House with a transitional cap beginning July 1. But the Senate nixed that initial cap, settling only on a slightly lower cap that would take effect next January.Supporters have said a cap on outpatient pharmaceuticals could provide the most immediate relief to health care insurance costs of any measure lawmakers have considered this year. The bill now heads to Gov. Phil Scott for his consideration. — Shaun RobinsonA bill that would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is also headed to Gov. Scott’s desk, after a largely party-line vote in the House on Thursday evening.

The Connecticut Senate on Friday overwhelmingly passed the most significant reform to the state’s towing policies in decades, a measure lawmakers said would help protect drivers from predatory towing.
House Bill 7162 overhauls the state’s century-old towing statutes and comes in response to an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of drivers. It takes several steps to make it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
The bill, which passed the House of Representatives last week with wide bipartisan support and little debate, sailed through the Senate on a 33-3 vote.
“It’s reform that ensures transparency, it ensures fairness and accountability, but does all of this without undercutting the essential work that ethical and professional tow operators do each and every day for us, keeping our roads safe and our properties accessible,” said Transportation Committee Co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford. “We’ve learned over the years, and particularly over the last year due to some investigative reporting, of some particularly egregious circumstances.”
A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont said the governor plans to sign the bill into law.
Republican Sen. Tony Hwang, ranking member of the Transportation Committee, also spoke in favor of the bill. The bill got about a half hour of debate ahead of passage, and there were no comments in opposition.
Hwang, who represents Fairfield, said the bill strikes the right balance between the interests of towers and consumers.
“I want to acknowledge that our press had an important part to bring out transparency and some of the bad actions, and I think in this bill we address some of those issues,” Hwang said. “We took measures to ensure that there is due process, and what has been discovered to have occurred in a criminal action, I believe, should never, ever happen again, to undermine the trust that we have to have in this process.”
Connecticut’s law allows tow companies to begin the process to sell vehicles after just 15 days. CT Mirror and ProPublica found that it is one of the shortest windows in the nation, and that the law has particularly impacted people with low incomes. Reporters spoke with people who said towing companies required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to get personal belongings out of their vehicles. Many couldn’t afford to get their towed vehicles back and lost transportation or jobs because of it.
After weeks of negotiations, lawmakers said they came to a compromise with the towing industry. Two bills were merged to include massive reforms to towing procedures from private property and rate increases for highway tows that typically follow car accidents.
The bill that passed and would take effect Oct. 1 requires tow companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles immediately just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or parked in an accessible spot.
Under the bill, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but they would now have to take more steps to give the owner a chance to claim the vehicle. The Department of Motor Vehicles would be required to check whether the driver filed any complaints about the tow before approving the sale, and the tower would have to send a notice ahead of the sale to the registered owner and lienholders via certified mail, with receipts of delivery.
The actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
The bill also requires that towers take at least two photos before they tow a vehicle — one of the violation that resulted in a tow and another of any damage to the vehicle. Cohen said this would help determine if vehicles had any missing parts before the tow, a seeming nod to the news organizations’ story about a DMV employee who the agency’s investigators found schemed with a towing company to undervalue vehicles and sell them for thousands in profit. (The employee denied he did anything wrong, and the agency ultimately took no action in that case.)
The bill also establishes a working group to study how to handle proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles. State law requires that towing companies hold profits in escrow for a year in case the vehicle owner claims them, then remit that money to the state. But CT Mirror and ProPublica found the DMV never set up a system for that process to occur.
Additionally, it calls for the DMV to work with the state’s attorney general to develop a consumer bill of rights on towing.
Tow companies have to be available after hours and on weekends to allow people to get their vehicles or personal property. In a story published this month, CT Mirror and ProPublica reported that tow truck companies sometimes hold onto people’s belongings to pressure them into paying their towing fees.
Under the new law, drivers will be allowed to retrieve their belongings from their vehicles, even if they haven’t paid the towing fees. State regulations currently allow vehicle owners to retrieve only “personal property which is essential to the health or welfare of any person.”
Cohen listed many of the issues outlined in the news outlets’ reporting as “some of the worst abuses of predatory towing practices.”
Timothy Vibert, president of Towing and Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said the industry initially opposed the bill because towers believed it would impede their ability to tow cars and clear traffic. He also said towers weren’t involved enough in the original draft. But they worked with lawmakers on the bill over several weeks, and he issued a statement in support this week.
“The people of Connecticut deserve safety, accountability and transparency when their cars are towed, and so do the people who work for Connecticut’s towing companies who risk our lives every day to make our roads safe,” Vibert said. “We all need clear, easy-to-follow rules.”
DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera commended the House and Senate.
“The DMV fully supports this initiative, as it not only enhances the framework for fair and equitable enforcement of towing laws but also provides a clear path forward for our agency to advance these efforts,” Guerrera said in a statement.
Cohen said that the bill aims to “fix a broken process,” and that lawmakers had worked on some aspects of it for years before the bill passed.
News of the bill’s passage brought relief to Melissa Anderson, who was featured in a CT Mirror and ProPublica story after her car was towed and sold from her Hamden apartment because of an expired parking permit.
The bill requires a 72-hour grace period before a car can be towed for an expired parking sticker to allow people time to get a new one.
“I’m glad we made a difference,” Anderson said. “This is going to help a lot of people.”
The bill next heads to Lamont’s desk.
“The Governor appreciates all the work that went into this legislation, which provides greater protections for the public and their vehicles,” Lamont’s spokesperson, Rob Blanchard, said in a text message. “He plans on signing the legislation once it reaches his desk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0530_SR_SenateTowingBill_121-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 19:05:52.978540

Greg Gianforte vetoed a “river census” bill, arguing the work to collect data can be done in a “more cost effective manner,” but the sponsor said a special revenue account has the money, and Montana needs clarity about river use.
House Bill 762 would require Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks to produce a report of all watercraft, from rafts to inflatable flamingoes, along 966 miles of 16 rivers in the state.
Rep. Joshua Seckinger, a river guide, said the legislation is necessary because rivers are busy, and attempts have been made to regulate them, but with only anecdotal evidence, not hard data.
In his veto letter, however, Gianforte argued the cost of the river census was much too high, and the project too large, although he said the bill is “well intended.”
“House Bill 762 drains $2.6 million from the state parks account, which would otherwise be used to address important infrastructure projects at our state parks, including maintenance backlogs,” Gianforte said in his veto letter.
The bill had bipartisan sponsorship. It earned 102 approvals altogether in its final votes in both chambers — 29 in the Senate and 73 in the House.

Support from two thirds of the Montana Legislature triggers an automatic veto override poll from the Secretary of State.
Friday, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office could not be reached via email about the status of polling. Friday, the bill wasn’t among the list of those currently being polled.
However, in a letter to his colleagues, Seckinger, D-Bozeman, said he hopes they consider overriding the veto. He said he respectfully disagrees with the governor’s assessment the bill “took too big a bite at the apple.”
“First, there is no additional cost to taxpayers,” Seckinger wrote. “The bill would have been funded entirely from a special revenue account within FWP, which is supported by vehicle registration fees, the cannabis excise tax, and state park registrations.
“Even with HB 762, this fund would have had a $6 million ending balance. Without the bill, the fund’s balance will now grow to $8.6 million — unused, and continuing to expand.”
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan, Seckinger said he agreed the cost “was not insignificant.”
But if fiscal conservatism is the goal, he said, he would advocate for lowering license plate fees, cannabis taxes, and the other sources of funds for the account.
In his letter, Seckinger also said the bill would have provided a “comprehensive understanding of river use,” and objective, baseline data is needed — “and we need it soon.”
(A separate study out of Montana State University will review popular river stretches not included in the bill.)
In his veto letter, Gianforte, a Republican, agreed that river usage “has increased dramatically in recent years.”
However, he said he believes the state can achieve the same goal over a longer period, potentially using a pilot program to study a portion of the river stretches in the bill.
“The idea of a pilot program is just an example, and over the course of the interim, I look forward to working with the bill sponsor, members of the Legislature, and FWP officials to find a more cost effective way of addressing this important need,” Gianforte said in the letter.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/61CED28A-14EE-495A-B106-057924317CC1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 19:05:52.978540

Montana, filed suit in U.S. District Court on Thursday against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, argue three of Trump’s executive orders issued earlier this year to “unleash” the fossil fuel industry and remove climate protections threaten their constitutional rights to life and liberty. 
“President Trump’s EOs falsely claim an energy emergency, while the true emergency is that fossil fuel pollution is destroying the foundation of Plaintiffs’ lives,” the lawsuit states. “These unconstitutional directives have the immediate effect of slowing the buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure that eliminates planet-heating fossil fuel greenhouse gas pollution … and increasing the use of fossil fuels that pollute the air, water, lands, and climate on which Plaintiffs’ lives depend.”
The lead plaintiff, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser, from Livingston, is one of several Montana plaintiffs who also filed the landmark Held case, which prevailed in Montana District Court and, in late 2024, in the Montana Supreme Court. Lighthiser is joined in the suit by Rikki Held, Lander and Badge Busse — sons of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ryan Busse — and five others from the Montana lawsuit, as well as young people from Hawai‘i, Oregon, California, and Florida. 
Plaintiffs from Hawai’i were also involved in a successful youth-led climate lawsuit against the state’s Department of Transportation. 
During a seven-day bench trial before Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley in 2023, Held and 15 youth plaintiffs were found to have a right to a stable climate system under Montana’s constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment.”
The Held decision, affirmed by the state Supreme Court in December, is mentioned numerous times in the Lighthiser case, and several of the same law firms are representing the plaintiffs in the new suit.

Eleven federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA, are named as defendants along with the president. 
Three of Trump’s executive orders — 14156, 14154 and 14261 — declare a “national energy emergency” and direct numerous federal agencies to “unleash American energy” by accelerating oil, gas and coal production on federal lands, and bolster fossil fuel development. They also roll back funding that bolstered climate protections, including through the Inflation Reduction Act. Various clean energy grant programs, including wind, solar battery storage and electric vehicles, were also targeted in the orders. 
The 126-page complaint argues that the federal directives threaten the plaintiffs’ health and wellbeing by accelerating harms from the fossil fuel industry and climate change. 
“Plaintiffs were born into and now live in a destabilized climate system. Fossil fuel pollution has created this emergency—a dangerous situation for Plaintiffs requiring immediate action,” the suit states. “… EPA reports that climate change effects, including heat, displacement, financial or food insecurity, loss of recreation, loss of sleep, and risk of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), harm children’s health.”
The plaintiffs are asking for the court to find the three executive orders “and any implementing executive actions” unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid, and seek a permanent injunction against implementing and enforcing the orders. 
In a statement, Deputy White House press secretary Harrison Fields said the executive orders are part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to protect Americans.
“Promoting domestic energy production is crucial for shielding American families from price volatility and securing a stable energy supply for our nation and its allies. The President has a proven history of bolstering American energy production and will restore our nation’s position as a global energy leader,” Fields said in a statement.
A representative for the Department of Justice declined to comment. 
In a press release about the lawsuit, Lighthiser said Trump’s executive orders amount to a “death sentence for my generation.” 
“I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.” 
In the suit, the plaintiffs list harms experienced in their young lives related to climate change, including from longer wildfire seasons that affect their health, increasingly extreme weather patterns that affect their livelihoods, and changes to their local environments and cultural homes. The suit also mentions the executive orders’ effect on decreasing career opportunities for some plaintiffs, through canceled climate science research and study programs. 
The complaint also condemns the federal government’s directives to implement the executive orders by “a wholesale scrubbing, suppression and dismantling of government agencies’ climate science, thereby blinding the government,” and argues that the  President exceeded his constitutional and statutory authority— “acting ultra vires” — in issuing the executive orders. 
The youth are represented by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based law firm, along with Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law in Kalispell, and Public Justice. 
l“These young plaintiffs refuse to be collateral damage in a fossil fuel war on their future,” lead attorney Julia Olson of Our Children’s Trust said in a press release. “They are demanding accountability where it still matters—in a court of law. The executive branch is not above the Constitution, and these young people are here to prove it.”

Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) renewed his call for the Upper Pecos watershed to be protected from mining claims in a letter sent recently to the top federal forestry official.
In the May 23 letter to U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, Heintch notes that watershed is crucial for fishing, agriculture and traditional uses, but “has a history of poorly managed mining projects.”
He noted New Mexico officials are still cleaning up pollution from a 1991 spill when snowmelt flooded an abandoned mine. The slurry spilled into the Pecos River and killed thousands of fish across 11 miles. New Mexico has spent millions of dollars on the cleanup, which remains ongoing.
“I would like to extend an invitation to you to visit New Mexico and the Pecos area so you can hear firsthand from local leaders, Tribes, community members, farmers, business owners, recreationists, and others while experiencing the beauty of this watershed,” Heinrich wrote. “While there, you can see why this river is so valuable and witness the very real threat of mining pollution that still exists.”
The invitation comes as the Trump Administration reversed a decision to temporarily ban new mining development in the Upper Pecos made in December, prompting rebuke from members of the delegation, local officials and Pueblos of Jemez and Tesuque. 
Heinrich’s letter contained additional entreaties from tribal leaders to visit, so Schultz can better understand the region’s importance.
“Water is the blood of the Pueblo and all nearby communities. We cannot afford to again
place our life-giving waters in the hands of foreign-owned mining corporations,” wrote Tesuque Gov. Earl Samuel in a separate letter.
Emails to the U.S. Department of Agriculture requesting comment about the letter and any response from Schultz went unreturned Friday.
Luis Soriano, a spokesperson for Heinrich, said the office had not received a response to the letter as of Friday afternoon.

(Getty Images)Amid national outbreaks, a confirmed measles case hasn’t yet hit Utah — but as nearby states report cases, the highly contagious virus could be closing in. 
Meanwhile, Utah’s childhood vaccination rates have been on a steady decline for years. 
Local and state public health officials say it’s likely a matter of time before the Beehive State gets its first measles case, and they’re bracing for if or when it happens. 
“We’re always looking at cases in other states,” Rich Lakin, immunization program manager at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, told Utah News Dispatch this week. “We’ve been ready for a long time, but so far so good. We haven’t had any cases here in Utah.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But to be prepared, Lakin said state public health officials are working with local health departments, clinics, and physicians to ensure they know how to quickly identify a measles case and properly handle it when someone comes in for treatment. 
Nic Rupp, spokesperson for the Salt Lake County Health Department, said county health officials “monitor the status nationwide every day.” 
“We will likely see a case locally as infections get closer geographically and as people travel more this summer,” Rupp said.
In the meantime, he said the Salt Lake County Health Department is encouraging populations with low rates for the MMR vaccine (which protects against measles, mumps and rubella) to get up to date on their shots as part of efforts to minimize the spread of the virus “when a case does show up here.” 
The last reported measles infection in Utah was reported in March 2023, according to state health officials. 
“A person who was not vaccinated traveled outside the U.S. and brought measles back to Utah,” the state’s website says. “We do not believe anyone else in Utah got measles from this person.” 
Before that 2023 case, three people in Utah had measles in February 2017. 
Outbreaks
So far this year Utah’s neighboring state of Colorado has confirmed five cases, according to NBC News’ outbreak tracker. New Mexico has seen 79 cases, 14 of which have been reported in the last four weeks. In Texas, 753 cases have been confirmed, with 60 reported in the last four weeks. 
NM measles cases rise to 78, with possible exposures at Santa Fe and Albuquerque Walmarts

As of Thursday, a total of 1,088 confirmed measles cases have been reported in 2025 from 33 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those include Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Fourteen outbreaks have been reported so far in 2025, and 90% of those confirmed cases (977 of 1,088) have been outbreak associated, according to the CDC. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024, and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak associated. 
Utah’s vaccination rate is dropping, on pace with regional declines
For several years now, Utah health officials have tracked a decline in the state’s early childhood MMR vaccinations. 
According to the state’s immunization dashboard, the percentage of Utah children that received at least one dose of the MRR vaccine at 24 months old has dropped from 94.5% of those born in 2019 to 89.8% of those born in 2021. 
“It has dropped,” Lakin said. 
  (Courtesy of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services)
He pointed out that the region, which also includes the states of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, has gone from a 98.3% for the birth year of 2019 “all the way down to 86.4%.”
“So the region as a whole is not doing very well,” he said. That concerns public health officials because travelers tend to visit nearby states, “anytime you get cases in other states, then it increases our chances of getting a measles case here in Utah.” 
The ideal vaccination rate to reach herd immunity protection against measles is 95%, he said. Young children are also most at risk if they contract the virus. 
“The thing that would concern us the most would be for an adult to get measles, and then you pass it to a 6-month-old that hasn’t been vaccinated yet,” he said. 
The state’s dashboard is currently using the latest available data from 2023, Lakin said, but state officials are working to update it soon with 2024 data. Health officials expect that Utah’s immunization rate has continued to decline. 
“The expectation is, yes, it is continuing to decline,” he said, though he added, “by how much, I do not know yet.” 
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

State 2023 data shows public school districts tend to have higher immunization rates than charter schools. In Salt Lake County, Canyons, Granite, Jordan, Murray and Salt Lake City school districts, all had more than 95% immunization rates for the second dose of MMR vaccine in K-12 schools, compared to 91.8% in charter schools. 
However, according to that data, only 92.3% of kindergartners in Salt Lake County are up to date on measles vaccination — below the ideal 95% herd immunity threshold. 
Last year, Axios reported Utah has one of the nation’s highest rates of childhood vaccine waivers. Religious exemptions accounted for the fastest-rising share of exemptions since before the pandemic, accounting for 13% of Utah’s waivers last year, up from 5.9% in 2019, according to a state report released last year. The vast majority, however, are attributed to “personal belief,” accounting for 84.9% of the waivers in the 2023 to 2024 school year. 
Measles vaccine is safe and saves lives
Given the troubling pattern of declining vaccination rates across Utah and other states amid deepening distrust of institutions in the U.S., Lakin acknowledged its “difficult” to encourage people to vaccinate their children, but he said health officials will continue to try to ensure Utahns get accurate information. 
“Look at the history,” he said, adding that back in the 1800s, “if your child lived to be an adult, you were very happy. Because they either got smallpox or they got measles or they got mumps, or they got rubella, tetanus, or diphtheria. … I mean, think of all these vaccine preventable diseases that we just don’t see anymore, and it’s because of vaccinations.”
Nonpartisan poll finds ‘remarkably low’ trust in federal health agencies

Lakin said “unfortunately people are losing sight of what these vaccinations are doing and getting the wrong information in such a fast-paced world that we live in now.” 
“They’re not getting the right information anymore,” he said. “That’s what our continued message is — that vaccinations have been one of the greatest public health achievements we have seen, and we want to continue to keep people safe through vaccinations.” 
In a news release issued back in February — after Texas announced the first death of a school-aged child from measles — the Salt Lake County Health Department urged people to ensure they’re protected. 
“For decades, the MMR vaccine has been proven safe and effective,” said Dorothy Adams, executive director of the Salt Lake County Health Department. “Ensuring now that you and your loved ones are adequately protected will help prevent serious illness in our community if this current multistate measles outbreak spreads to Utah.” 
Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, and it can be so easily spread that people who are not immune have a 90% chance of catching it if they go near an infected person. Someone with measles can spread it to others even before they know they are ill, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.  
Salt Lake County health officials said the best protection against measles is to be immunized with two doses of the MMR vaccine, which can prevent more than 97% of measles infections. In the remaining 3% of cases — when a fully vaccinated person catches measles — the symptoms are milder, the illness is shorter, and the infected person is less likely to spread it. 
Unvaccinated people, including children who are too young to be vaccinated, are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection. 



How to know if you’re up to date on measles shots
Measles vaccine recommendations vary based on age and vaccination history. Here’s what public health experts recommend: 

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. 
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. 
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to 1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. 
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (college students, health care workers, international travelers) should have two doses.

(Courtesy of Los Alamos National Laboratory)As New Mexico water and fire managers prepare for increased drought and wildfire danger this summer, Los Alamos National Laboratory officials say the lab has taken steps to mitigate those threats on its campus.
LANL provided a media tour mid-week to highlight those steps, but did not allow outside photography or recording.
“We’re very proud of our preparedness efforts for wildfire,” said Deputy Laboratory Director of Operations Mark Davis from the floor of the Emergency Operations Center, as videos of the 2022 Cerro Pelado fire played across six screens on the wall. “We want to show our efforts to communicate how our mitigation efforts will protect the lab, workforce, community and environment.”
The state has identified the towns of Los Alamos and White Rock as high risk areas for wildfire threats, including LANL, which spans 36 square miles of mesas and canyons. The lab and surrounding town have been evacuated twice in the past 30 years due to fires. That included evacuations for two weeks during the Cerro Grande Fire in 2000, which burned 43,000 acres total, including 45 lab buildings and 7,500 acres of LANL property. Los Alamos evacuated for another 10 days during the 2011 Las Conchas fire, which burned more than 156,000 acres, though only one acre on the lab’s property.
In 2022, during the same time the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon fires raged, the Cerro Pelado fire, also caused by a controlled burn, sparked up and ultimately burned 45,000 acres, requiring the lab to move to remote work in preparation for an evacuation.
In 2022, at the request of the Biden Administration, LANL released its Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Resilience Plan, which showed that increased wildfire presented the highest risks to equipment, electricity systems, onsite radioactive waste processing, buildings, water systems and communications systems.
Critics say climate threats to the laboratory are compounding. LANL’s proposed thinning is “a slow job, but certainly necessary,” said Greg Mello, the executive director of nuclear nonproliferation nonprofit Los Alamos Study Group. But he said the hazards with climate change are stacking up.
“We just wish that the laboratory wasn’t straining against every single environmental constraint that there is on that plateau,” Mello said. “The laboratory is too big and trying to do too much in a place that was never appropriate for a laboratory of the present scale, let alone the additional laboratory facilities and staff that they envision.”
The approximately 18,000 people employed at LANL work mostly in science and engineering, from modeling infectious diseases to increasing the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile.
“Our missions are vital and critical to national security and they cannot fail,” Davis said.

The here and now
The Jemez wilderness bears scars from the Cerro Grande and Las Conchas fires. Large bald patches with skinny charred remains of the ponderosa pines stand among scrub oak brush replacing the once-forested area.
Recent scattered rainstorms offered a small reprieve, but the area remains in Stage 1 fire restrictions — an elevated threat level that restricts all campfires or outdoor burning.
Laboratory facilities are interspersed on the top of mesas to higher elevation ponderosa pine forests, separated by canyons and arroyos filled with brush. The lab is bordered by federally managed forests; San Ildefonso and Jemez Pueblos; and Santa Fe and Los Alamos County land.
The patchwork of agencies has complicated firefighting and mitigation efforts in the past, said Jeff Dare, who leads the Emergency Operations Center, but Cerro Pelado offered a framework for more cooperation with members of county government and liaisons for surrounding federal agencies and tribal governments.
The lab is part of the Master Cooperative Wildland Fire Response Agreement, which allocates additional resources such as helicopters and personnel to fight any wildfire that does appear, Dare said, adding: “It protects the laboratory before it can get here.”
 ‘Hope is not a strategy’
The more recent focus has been trimming back the areas around lab buildings, roads and utility lines, said Richard Nieto, LANL’s wildland fire program manager. Trimming has occurred on an estimated 12% to 15% of lab property.

“Hope is not a strategy,” Nieto said, adding that the area needs to better adapt to fires when they happen. “This area was meant to burn; it’s what we have to deal with, ecologically.”
But overgrowth is a challenge. Much of the higher-elevation ponderosa forests sport 400 to 1,300 trees per acre, rather than the healthier 50 to 150 trees per acre, he said. Habitats for two endangered species and archeological sites also require consideration.
Beyond trimming, the lab is working on developing plans for prescribed burns, but will take another three to five years to realize, he said.
Preparations on the plateau
On the other side of lab property, fences looped with concertina wire and sporting signs warning of radiological hazards contain Area G.
Vaguely merengue- shaped white tents — coated in fireproof material — stand amid the juniper and piñon scrub. Inside, under crisscrossed steel frames, stacked white containers on metal pallets contain legacy waste from the lab’s work in the nuclear program.
The facilities are geared to reducing fire concerns, said Gail Helm, the facility operations director for N3B, which is contracted to manage the 10-year $2 billion dollar cleanup of Cold War Era legacy waste. The tents include fire detection and suppression. Concrete barricades surround them to prevent vehicle accidents and potential fires.

,DC,2025-05-30 22:00:21+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"PBS, Minnesota public TV station sue Trump over executive order cutting off funds",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pbs-minnesota-public-tv-station-sue-trump-over-executive-order-cutting-funds,,"WASHINGTON — The Public Broadcasting Service and Lakeland PBS in Minnesota sued the Trump administration Friday, arguing an executive order seeking to cut off their federal funding violates the Constitution and would “upend public television.”The lawsuit was filed just days after a collection of National Public Radio stations sued President Donald Trump over the same executive order, which blocked the Corporation from Public Broadcasting from funding the networks.PBS wrote in its 48-page filing that it disagrees with claims made by the executive order, including that federal spending on public media is “corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence” and that the news organization doesn’t present “a fair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.”“PBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,” the lawsuit states. “But regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS’s programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.”The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, but hadn’t been assigned to a judge as of Friday evening.White House: PBS supports ‘a particular political party’White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields wrote in a statement responding to the lawsuit that the “Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime.“Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.”The lawsuit says Trump’s executive order violates the law that governs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which gives it independence from politicians who might try to control its programs.“Congress took pains to ensure that the development of public television would be free from political interference, including with respect to content and funding decisions,” the suit states.It also claims implementing the order would violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.“The EO makes no attempt to hide the fact that it is cutting off the flow of funds to PBS because of the content of PBS programming and out of a desire to alter the content of speech,” the lawsuit states. “That is blatant viewpoint discrimination and an infringement of PBS and PBS Member Stations’ private editorial discretion.”PBS says federal funds ‘instrumental’ for operationsThe lawsuit says the loss of funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting envisioned in the executive order would upend programming at PBS and its member stations throughout the country.“Public television stations receive approximately $325 million in annual federal funding from CPB, nearly all of which goes to PBS Member Stations,"" the lawsuit states. ""Those funds, which comprise more than 50% of the overall budgets of certain PBS Member Stations, are instrumental to enabling them to operate, to produce programming that serves their local communities, and to pay PBS dues that make PBS programming and services possible.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids filed a motion to intervene in the case […],"Efforts to collect signatures for two proposed ballot measures for the 2026 election will begin this fall, following the attorney general's approval of ballot language Thursday. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas and the state attorney general argued in federal court filings this week that two ballot question committees are not entitled to intervene in the League’s lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of direct democracy laws.
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids filed a motion to intervene in the case on May 14, arguing that their interests aren’t “adequately represented” because the League’s suit didn’t challenge all the laws they intended to. The committees also argued that intervening is more efficient than filing a separate lawsuit, which they said would likely be consolidated with the League’s complaint under federal court rules. 
Arkansas grassroots organizations seek to intervene in lawsuit challenging direct democracy laws 

In its response to the motion, which was filed by Little Rock attorney David Couch on Wednesday, the League of Women Voters of Arkansas and ballot question committee Save AR Democracy (SARD) argue the two ballot question committees don’t have standing and have no right to intervene because they are not questioning LWVAR’s ability to challenge the laws in the original complaint. 
LWVAR filed a federal lawsuit against the Arkansas secretary of state in April alleging that eight recently approved state laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The motion to intervene from Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids seeks to challenge two laws not included in the League of Women Voters’ suit — Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level, and Act 236 of 2023, which mandates petition signatures must be collected from at least 50 counties instead of 15 as directed in the Arkansas Constitution, according to court filings. 
Protect AR Rights and For AR Kids also seek to add an additional defendant, Attorney General Tim Griffin, who is not a party to the pending litigation but is counsel for the secretary of state, which would further complicate the matter, according to LWVAR’s response. 
Grade-level requirement
In the defendant’s response, also filed Wednesday, Griffin noted that when he certified For AR Kids’ popular name and ballot title for a proposed education-related constitutional amendment on Feb. 26, the ballot title didn’t need to meet the reading-level requirement because Act 602 was not yet in effect.
The League and Save AR Democracy made the same point in their filing to argue that For AR Kids lacks standing to challenge the reading-level law. 
Protect AR Rights submitted its own proposed direct-democracy ballot title on May 19 that’s still under review by the attorney general. LWVAR argues this group also does not have standing because its proposed ballot title has not been rejected because of Act 602. 
LWVAR argues that challenging Act 602 is further complicated because Griffin substituted and certified Save AR Democracy’s ballot title on May 21 so that it would meet the eighth-grade reading level test. 
“Even if Protect AR Rights had standing, the inclusion of that issue in the litigation would unnecessarily complicate this matter,” the response states. “Nothing would prohibit Protect AR Rights from instituting litigation if it is denied a ballot title to meet the eighth grade reading level test.”
Griffin argues that the motion to intervene should be denied because Protect AR Rights is the only party that can challenge Act 602. This is also the only claim that can be made against the attorney general, he said. 
State law requires the attorney general to certify or reject proposed ballot titles within 10 business days. The deadline for a response to Protect AR Rights’ proposal is June 3. Because it is still under review, allowing the ballot question committee to intervene “would require finding an injury in fact where such harm is hypothetical and not concrete,” Griffin wrote. 
“Because Plaintiff SARD was able to satisfy the Act 602 requirement, the court has to resort to speculation to determine that Protect AR Rights’ ballot title could never be at an eighth-grade reading level,” he said. “For the same reasons, Protect AR Rights cannot bring a cause of action against Attorney General Griffin.”
County signatures
Regarding the proposed intervenors’ challenge to the 2023 law requiring signatures from 50 counties, LWVAR’s response notes that this law is already being challenged by the League in Pulaski County Circuit Court. The case has been fully argued, briefed and is awaiting the court’s ruling. 
Plaintiffs argue there is no need for the claim to be pursued at this time and if it were allowed, it should be held in abeyance under the Pullman Doctrine, which provides that federal courts defer to state courts if the state ruling would resolve the federal issue. 
“The issue before the Circuit Court is simply, can the Arkansas General Assembly amend the Arkansas State Constitution by statute? The League believes that it cannot, and a ruling in its favor would resolve the federal issue,” according to court documents.
Griffin also cited the Pullman Doctrine and noted that the losing party in the case is expected to appeal to the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
“Thus, the [federal] Court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over this claim, which is only being made by Movants to intervene,” he wrote. “Standing alone, this claim cannot be a basis for Movants to be entitled to intervention.” 
Additional concerns
LWVAR further argues that Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure “would conflict with and be in direct competition with” Save AR Democracy’s approved measure because both seek to amend Article 5, Section 1 of the state Constitution, which governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. 
“It would be improper for the Protect AR Rights to intervene in litigation filed by SARD to get a measure approved that directly competes with the measure already approved and being circulated by SARD, in that it would create unnecessary conflict,” according to LWVAR’s response. 
Save AR Democracy also argues Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure contradicts with a claim made in the complaint — that the “exhaustive list of disqualifying offenses” that prohibits individuals from collecting signatures is unconstitutional. 
“The measure submitted by Protect AR Rights to the Attorney General for approval would enshrine this very prohibition in the Arkansas constitution,” the response says. “This represents a core political and policy difference between SARD and Protect AR Rights and would inject unnecessary controversy and conflict into the litigation.”
Protect AR Rights’ proposal also sets forth a procedure regarding a legal challenge to the ballot title that “differs substantially” from Save AR Democracy’s procedure. 
Save AR Democracy’s measure would require an approved ballot title to be submitted to the secretary of state who publishes notice of approval and the procedure for challenging the approval. The measure would establish a 45-day window during which a challenge could be filed with the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
The Protect AR Rights measure would require a challenge to be filed within 10 business days of the attorney general sending the sponsor a letter approving the ballot title, but it provides for no notice. Providing the public “adequate notice and opportunity” is essential to due process, the response states.

According to Alyssa Chen, a coordinator with Education Justice, schools in Montpelier and Brattleboro also held protests.READ MORE
At Champlain Valley Union High School, the May 21 protest was particularly resonant. Last month, two of the students’ peers chose to leave the country in response to the federal government’s attempt to revoke the humanitarian protections granting them legal residence. The teens were originally from Nicaragua, a country that has been experiencing state-led violence and repression since 2018. They had been sponsored by a local family member and looked forward to furthering their education in the United States. Faced with potential deportation and an uncertain future, they chose to leave instead.While, as with the two high school students, the impact of some of the changes in the Trump administration’s immigration policies have been acute in the district, the student protest rejected a broad swath of the federal government’s actions, including the administration’s challenge to birthright citizenship.“We can’t control every decision made by those in power, but we can control how we show up for each other, and when we lead with empathy, when we choose compassion over fear, that’s when real change begins,” Lily Williams, one of the senior class co-presidents said to the students gathered.Armed with signs bearing slogans such as “Borders shouldn’t define humanity,” and “Education not deportation,” the students marched down the sidewalk beside the school.Champlain Valley Union High School students walked out of class last week to protest federal immigraiont policy. Photo by Briana Brady/Shelburne NewsThe school administration was on board with the student action. One of their librarians provided a speaker system and microphone. Other teachers and staff, decked out in reflective vests, helped guide the teens safely through the parking lot. Their principal, Katherine Riley, stood nearby.For Olivia Ceiri, a sophomore and member of the school’s Racial Alliance Committee, this action was just one of many she encouraged students to take, suggesting that they build a habit of standing up for what they believed.“If we are willing to commit our time, love and well-being to the betterment of others, we will not be denied. We pledge to each other our responsibility to act and agree to stand by our values no matter the cost,” Ceiri said.The Education Justice Coalition of Vermont, which helped organize students across the state wanted to support the students to plan the walkouts themselves.“I’ve been working with like, half a dozen youth leaders, and several dozen other youth who have been attending weekly meetings on and off to plan the walkout so that it’s coordinated and supported. And so, mainly, we created a toolkit,” Chen said.In this way, the coalition wasn’t just leading the students in protest. As Ceiri wanted, they were teaching the kids how to lead each other in protest.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Champlain Valley Union students protest immigration policies.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cvu-protest-1.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting “988” or chatting online at http://988lifeline.org/.
A 64-year-old man from Cuba started strangling himself and saying he was going to kill himself after federal agents arrested him at the Miami immigration court on Friday morning.
Jesus Rodriguez Delgado, 64, started yelling in Spanish that he would kill himself rather than be sent back to Cuba, said Karla De Anda, a community advocate who called for help as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents struggled to remove Rodriguez Delgado’s handcuffed hands from his neck.
“It was the most horrible thing I’ve seen in my life,” De Anda said in Spanish. “Hopefully, they’ll help him because he can’t go back to Cuba.”
The man’s reaction wasn’t surprising to his partner, Elisavel Torres, who told Florida Phoenix from inside the courthouse that Rodriguez Delgado had been a political prisoner in Cuba for 28 years and had lived in Mexico for six years before coming to the U.S. De Anda added that Rodriguez Delgado had said he had been imprisoned and would be killed if deported to Cuba.
Torres wept as she said that she couldn’t understand why the judge agreed to dismiss Rodriguez Delgado’s deportation case — exposing him to expedited removal. An application for permanent residency that Rodriguez Delgado submitted in January states he entered the country under humanitarian parole in 2021. Torres said Rodriguez Delgado received a work permit in April.
“He had told me he wouldn’t go back to Cuba, that he would die first, and it will be that way,” Torres told the Phoenix in Spanish.
ICE and Homeland Security Investigations officials arrested at least seven people during the four hours that the Phoenix reporter observed activity inside the courthouse.
Reports emerged last week of arrests in immigration courts across the country after judges dismissed cases at the request of the Department of Homeland Security. Still, Rodriguez Delgado’s attempt to strangle himself was the strongest reaction advocates witnessed on Friday. Others arrested cried and some remained quiet and looked at the ground.
‘You show up and get deported anyway’: Migrants with court hearings face an impossible choice

The agents told Torres that they would make sure Rodriguez Delgado was OK and would give him a list of pro bono attorneys, but couldn’t at the time of his arrest say where he would go. Torres, a U.S. citizen, said the couple knew about the arrests but still decided to come to the hearing from Naples rather than requesting an online hearing.
“We had faith in God that we were doing everything right, so we said we would come in person,” Torres said. “What a huge mistake.”
Her tears intensified as she told Rodriguez Delgado’s daughter about her father’s arrest over the phone.
“I was born in this country, and I am ashamed to say I’m American,” Torres said, adding that there were no words to describe how she felt when federal agents placed her partner in handcuffs.
Immigrants lack legal representation
Immigration attorney Cindy Blandon told the Phoenix that she’s noticed those who end up arrested for expedited removal lack lawyers. Few people in the court on Friday morning had attorneys, with some citing money as a barrier to obtaining legal representation.
Having an ongoing asylum or permanent residency case doesn’t exempt people from expedited deportations, Blandon said.
“Being placed under an expedited removal process doesn’t mean your case is closed,” she said. “People have a right to due process. The problem is that if you don’t have legal representation and you don’t know how to navigate the situation, you will likely end up deported.”
The mood on various floors of the courthouse grew more tense as people awaiting hearings heard about or saw the arrests.
But Blandon, De Anda, and Maria Asuncion Bilbao, with the American Friends Service Committee, noted that the arrests in the court appeared much calmer compared to the mass raids, such as the one that took place in Tallahassee on Thursday.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Potentially dangerous and possibly record-breaking warm weather is headed to western Montana this weekend.
On Thursday, the National Weather Service Office in Missoula issued a heat advisory from noon to 9 p.m. on Saturday. Temperatures in the upper 80s and 90s are expected for a wide swath of western Montana stretching from the Canadian border down through the Flathead, Missoula and Bitterroot valleys.
NWS Meteorologist Jennifer Kitzmiller, based in Missoula, said seeing temperatures in the 90s this early in the year was atypical. Anaconda, Eureka, Libby and Phillipsburg are some of the places that could approach their daily high record mark, if not break it.
“We’re looking at setting records for daily high temperatures tomorrow and a lot of places in western Montana,” Kitzmiller said. “And previous records date back to 1986 … we haven’t seen temperatures this warm, this time of year, for like 40 years.”
The heat is being driven by a strong ridge of high pressure in the West, according to a NWS national report. Temperatures are expected to dip back down on Sunday.
“It’s not going to be hugely different, but it’ll cool us back down,” Kitzmiller said.
The weather service also issued some recommendations, including drinking plenty of water and staying out of direct sunlight. 
Warm weather also draws people to bodies of water, especially on a weekend, which can add a degree of danger. May 24 was particularly deadly as a woman drowned near Missoula near Maclay Bridge and a kayaker died near Craig. Additionally, a 68-year old Missoula man last seen on Wednesday is presumed to have drowned near the Lochsa River in Idaho.
Lifevests should always be worn when on or in the water, and a close eye should be kept on children. Additionally, alcohol can enhance hypothermia, and cold water can make even experienced swimmers lose muscle control.
“The rivers and streams are still running fast and cold,” Kitzmiller said. “And there’s that extra threat, despite the warm temperatures, for hypothermia.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BigHoleRiver-Stock-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well. 


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
Gov. Kim Reynolds calls Iowa ‘a pro-family state’
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Iowa law gives four weeks of paid leave
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

State regulators have reinstated the license of an Iowa insurance agent who was convicted of falsifying records that resulted in increased commissions.
State records indicate that in February 2024, Country Mutual Insurance notified the Iowa Insurance Division that it had fired one of its agents, Pablo Castillo of Norwalk, for allegedly submitting forged documents that he had created to establish clients’ eligibility for coverage and to provide them with discounts on home insurance.
It was alleged that in order to sell an auto insurance policy to three separate consumers, Castillo fabricated letters from another insurance company to falsely suggest each of the consumers had no prior gaps in their insurance coverage. In a fourth case, Castillo allegedly fabricated a letter from State Farm Insurance to explain a consumer’s involvement in two accidents.

Castillo was also accused of fabricating roofing invoices from fictitious businesses for at least four clients as a way of enhancing the value of any subsequent claims related to roof repairs.
In October 2024, the Iowa Insurance Division charged Castillo, 38, with engaging unfair, deceptive and dishonest conduct. Division records indicate that at a hearing on the matter, Castillo admitted falsifying the records, explaining that he did so to ensure his clients would be covered.
Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen subsequently suspended Castillo’s license for 30 days, stating that he found Castillo to be “a sincere, well-intentioned individual with generally good moral character.”
In November 2024, Polk County prosecutors charged Castillo with fraudulent sales practices and felony insurance fraud for falsifying records so he would “earn commissions on his sales that would otherwise be denied by the company.”
In April 2025, Castillo pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor tampering with records. He was sentenced to two years of probation, fined $855 fine, and granted a deferred judgment that will seal any court records related to the conviction upon the successful completion of probation.
Earlier this month, the Iowa Insurance Division ordered that Castillo’s license be reinstated. Pursuant to the 2024 suspension order, Castillo will be required to file with the division a periodic “summary of his work in the business of insurance.”

,DC,2025-05-30 21:30:25+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump ‘blatant’ refusal to comply in deportation case shows growing rift with judges,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-blatant-refusal-comply-deportation-case-shows-growing-rift-judges,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Maryland slammed the Trump administration Friday for its “blatant lack of effort to comply” with her order earlier this month to report steps taken to facilitate the return of a second wrongly deported man to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.“Defendants’ untimely response is the functional equivalent of, ‘We haven’t done anything and don’t intend to,’” U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2018, wrote in her order blasting a nonresponse from the Department of Homeland Security.“Telling this Court that ‘[i]t is DHS’s understanding that Cristian is in the custody of El Salvador,’ adds nothing to the underlying record and simply reflects a lack of any effort to obtain or provide information regarding Cristian’s ‘current physical location and custodial status,’” she wrote.Friday’s order from Gallagher is the latest scathing remark from federal judges who have found the Trump administration either violated their preliminary injunctions or restraining orders, or have broadly invoked executive privileges to stonewall information in immigration cases.Gallagher, like other federal judges who have found themselves in the spotlight for blocking immigration-related policies, raised concerns about the Trump administration skirting due process rights and slow-walking rectifying deportation mistakes as the government continues its aggressive campaign of mass deportations.Officials at the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump himself have continued to claim broad authority to conduct immigration removals. They have lashed out against the judges, labeling them as “activists” and accusing them of blocking the Trump administration’s agenda.“Its very important that we're able to get these people out fast,” Trump said during a press availability in the Oval Office Friday. “We have judges that don't want that to happen. It's a terrible thing.” Violating removal protectionsTwo cases of men whom the administration sent to El Salvador despite court orders blocking their removals stemmed from the first major case of the administration apparently disregarding a judicial order: a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg not to remove migrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.Despite the mid-March temporary restraining order from Boasberg, three planes landed in El Salvador hours later and roughly 300 men were sent to the Salvadoran mega-prison Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT. Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and a 20-year-old referred to in court documents only by the pseudonym Cristian, whose case Gallagher is handling, were among them.Abrego Garcia had, since 2019, a court order protecting him from deportation to his home country of El Salvador because an immigration judge was concerned he would face gang violence if returned.Cristian, who arrived in the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor, was part of a class action that barred removal from the U.S. while his asylum case was pending in immigration court.In both cases, the administration has said it is powerless to compel the Salvadoran government to release them, an argument Gallagher expressed frustration with Friday.“Defendants simply reiterated their well-worn talking points on their reasons for removing Cristian and failed to provide any of the information the Court required,” Gallagher wrote.The U.S. is paying El Salvador up to $15 million to detain removed immigrants.“As a Venezuelan native, he is in El Salvador only because the United States sent him there pursuant to an agreement apparently reached with the government of El Salvador,” Gallagher wrote.Judges see pattern of defianceIn Abrego Garcia’s high-profile case, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, also in Maryland, said “nothing has been done” by the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. Administration officials have admitted he was mistakenly deported to CECOT.Xinis recently denied the Department of Justice’s request for an extra 30 days to submit documents on its efforts to return Abrego Garcia.He remains in a lower-level prison in El Salvador, despite a Supreme Court order from April that directed the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.A judge in Massachusetts found the Trump administration violated his preliminary injunction barring third-country removals of migrants without due process after eight men were deported to South Sudan and given less than 24 hours to challenge their removal to a county on the cusp of another civil war.Boasberg, who sits in a federal court in the District of Columbia, found probable cause to hold Trump officials in contempt for violating his temporary restraining order that ordered deportation planes carrying men removed under the Alien Enemies Act to be returned to the U.S. over concerns they did not receive due process.The Trump administration has challenged all those decisions on an emergency basis to the U.S. Supreme Court.‘A judge in Boston running foreign policy’Top administration figures have argued it is the judges who have overstepped, trespassing on the executive branch’s role in setting foreign policy.In the Oval Office Friday, Trump singled out U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy, who is overseeing the case in Massachusetts.“You can’t have a judge in Boston running foreign policy in places all over the country because he has a liberal bent or he’s a radical left person,” Trump said.Murphy was appointed by former President Joe Biden.That case, which centers on removing migrants to a country they are not citizens of, could play an outsized role in the legal battle over the administration’s approach to immigration after Supreme Court decisions this month have allowed the Trump administration to end two temporary legal programs and exposed more than 800,000 immigrants to potential deportation.Many of those who lost protections hail from countries that are deemed too dangerous for return.‘Get them out rapidly’The Trump administration has publicly stated Abrego Garcia will not return and accused him, without producing evidence, that he is a leader of the MS-13 gang.The president has also acknowledged that if he wanted to, he could secure the return of Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. But Trump said he would not, alleging that Abrego Garcia has gang ties.The president posted pictures on social media of Boasberg, who was pressing Department of Justice attorneys for answers on if his order was deliberately violated. It prompted a rare response from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who stressed the importance of an independent judiciary.While the Supreme Court eventually lifted Boasberg's nationwide injunction on the use of the Alien Enemies Act, federal judges in Colorado and parts of New York and Texas have blocked use of the wartime law within their districts, citing concerns about due process.Top Trump officials, such as Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, have floated suspending habeas corpus, which allows people who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court.Habeas corpus claims are currently the only avenue that Venezuelans subject to the Alien Enemies Act have to challenge their deportation under the wartime law.“We can't keep them for years here as they go through trial,” Trump said Friday of swift deportations. “We have to get them out rapidly.” Abrego Garcia and CristianIn an April order, Gallagher wrote that Cristian’s case is similar to Abrego Garcia’s and that “like Judge Xinis in the Abrego Garcia matter, this court will order Defendants to facilitate Cristian's return to the United States so that he can receive the process he was entitled to under the parties' binding Settlement Agreement.”In that order, Gallagher said the federal government must show “a good faith request to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services).”On May 6, she affirmed her decision that the Trump administration must facilitate Cristian’s return, but put her own order on pause to allow for Department of Justice attorneys to appeal to the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.The appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to pause her order.Gallagher said Friday she would give the Trump administration officials until Monday to “remedy their noncompliance.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

Two companies in the area will lose $75 million each after their grant funding was eliminated by the U.S. Department of Energy. (John Coletti/The Image Bank)The U.S. Department of Energy announced Friday the cancellation of 24 awards issued by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations that impacts
two businesses in Alabama.
American Cast Iron Pipe Company and United States Pipe and Foundry Company, LLC were both set to receive $75 million in grant money from the Department of Energy but will no longer receive the funding in light of the grants getting canceled. 
“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a DOE press release. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”
A message was left with both companies Friday seeking comment.
According to a press release, American Cast Iron Pipe Company made it to the negotiation stage of the awards process and was planning to use the funding to replace single cupola furnaces with four coreless induction furnaces. This would have reduced the facility’s CO2 emissions by an estimated 62% and the melting/holding process CO2 emissions by 95%. 
The U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company said in a press release that they planned to use the money for Phase 1 of U.S. Pipe’s Iron Electric Induction Conversion project. The project involved replacing a coke-fired furnace with electric induction melting furnaces and would have resulted in an “estimated 73% reduction in carbon intensity at the Alabama Works ductile iron pipe production facility.”
Of the 24 awards given, nearly 70% were signed between Election Day last year and Jan. 20. By cancelling the awards, the Department of Energy is generating $3.6 billion in savings for Americans. 
The DOE said the awards have been terminated because they “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Birmingham-Alabama-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

The passage of Legislative Bill 647 was delayed because State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha wanted to remove State Sen. Tony Sorrentino’s proposal due to what she called a broken “agreement” regarding State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, which would have helped schools fund long-term substitutes so teachers could take paid time off around significant life events.  
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area said there was no “agreement” with the Legislature’s Revenue Committee. 
“There was no deal,” he said. “I was invited into a conversation to talk about the bills that were at play, including Senator [​Ashlei Spivey]’s bill. I told the participants in that meeting clearly that I will not make a deal. Each bill needs to stand on its own.”
The “deal” involved a bipartisan group on the Education Committee and the state’s largest teachers’ union — which led to a month-long effort to get a package of proposals out of committee. That package is dead, replaced by a watered-down clean-up bill. 
LB 647 advanced 35-13. That tally included the support of two Democrats, State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln and Dan Quick of Grand Island. Bostar said that he voted against including Sorrentino’s proposal during the last round of debate but decided to vote for LB 647 as a whole because it was needed to balance the budget. State Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island said his constituents have asked to be in favor of Sorrenino’s proposal. 
At least 42 states already allow such savings accounts to cover tuition at K-12 private schools, which was first allowed federally in 2018 after congressional passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for up to $10,000 per beneficiary per year. A 529 savings plan — in Nebraska, NEST 529 — offers tax breaks to encourage families or students to donate and allows the savings to grow tax-free and be used for an approved educational purpose. 
Nebraska voters in November repealed the state’s new school voucher or scholarship program that was set to steer public dollars to private schools, though conservative lawmakers and Gov. Jim Pillen have pledged to keep trying to pass a replacement.  Public school advocates have argued against using public funds for that purpose and said voucher programs in other states have bled public money needed for public education.

SPRINGFIELD — Terminally ill Illinoisans may have the legal option to end their own life with the help of a physician next year under a bill approved by lawmakers Thursday.

The procedure, which advocates and the bill call “medical aid in dying,” would give people in a sound mental state with severe health issues the option to end their life with the help of a doctor.

Under Senate Bill 1950, doctors would be allowed to prescribe terminally ill patients a lethal dose of medication that they could self-administer at a time of their choice.

Advocates for the procedure, which is legal in 10 states and the District of Columbia, say it provides agency to people at the end of their life.

“I want to enjoy the time I have left with my family and friends,” Deb Robertson, a terminally ill woman, told lawmakers via Zoom on Wednesday. “I don’t want to worry about how my death will happen. It’s really the only bit of control left for me.”

The measure passed in the House 63-42 after more than an hour of intense, sometimes tear-filled debate. It now awaits action in the Senate. Senators have a matter of hours to pass the bill before their scheduled adjournment Saturday.





The bill outlines a process that includes two doctors recommending the procedure, sometimes referred to as medically assisted suicide, and limits the people who are eligible. People must be of sound mind and have a prognosis of less than six months.

Death certificates of those who use the procedure would also list their underlying diseases, not “suicide,” reflecting the common belief among advocates that the procedure should not be called suicide. Bill sponsor Rep. Robyn Gabel, D-Evanston, noted in debate Thursday that the provision would also “prevent inappropriate suicide investigations.”

But even with these protections, some oppose allowing the procedure.

Medical associations are divided on the issue. The American Medical Association, the largest and most influential medical association, notes an “irreducible moral tension” inherent in the practice.

The AMA’s Code of Ethics, for many years, said the procedure is “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer.” The association has recently softened its stance, opening the door for physicians to act on their own conscience on the matter.

Rep. Bill Hauter, R-Morton, a practicing physician, opposed the bill and told his colleagues during debate Thursday that it “changes forever the soul of medicine.”

During the House debate, the division among the health care industry reared its head. Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights, is a hospice chaplain and was supportive of the bill.

“I've seen hospice ease pain and suffering and offer dignity and quality of life as people are dying, but I've also seen the rare moments when even the best care cannot relieve suffering and pain, when patients ask us with clarity and peace for the ability to choose how their life ends,” she said.

Outside of health care, religious groups and disability rights advocates are also divided. Members of both parties invoked their faith during floor debate, including Rep. Maurice West, D-Rockford, an ordained Christian minister.

“Life is sacred. Death is sacred, too,” West said. “The sanctity of life includes the sanctity of death. This bill allows, if one chooses by themselves, for someone with a terminal diagnosis to have a dignified death.""

Republicans, who are generally more aligned with pro-life religious groups, opposed the bill. Catholic groups say procedures like medically assisted suicide violate the church’s teachings and many conservative protestant groups oppose the practice as well.

Rep. Adam Niemerg, R-Dietrich, said the procedure does not “uphold the dignity of every human life.”

“This does not respect the Gospel,” Niemerg, who is Catholic, said during debate. “This does not respect the teachings of Jesus Christ or uphold the values of God.”

Disability rights activists are also split on the issue. Sebastian Nalls, a policy analyst at the disability rights organization Access Living, said that if the procedure is legalized, insurers may pressure some sick people into it instead of expensive treatment.

“This bill carries far too many loopholes and lacks oversight to be safe and equitable, but the bottom line for Access Living is this: The existence of assisted suicide is a threat, to not just the kind of health care we deserve, but a threat to our ability to live and die with dignity,” Nalls said in a committee hearing Wednesday.

Other disability rights advocates, like Beth Langen, note that ""disability is not terminal.”

“Death, like life, is easier to navigate when you know you will have options to choose from, even if you never need to,” Langen said at Wednesay’s hearing.

Recent increases in success rates at hunting exceedingly difficult-to-kill wolves are “really good,” a Wyoming biologist said, because it shows that fair-chase tactics are still working. 
The post What’s it take to kill a Wyoming wolf? Nearly 500 hunting days, and then it’s likely a youngster appeared first on WyoFile .","Last fall, hunters put in their time pursuing Wyoming deer. They spent 12 days afield, on average, per kill. About 60% were successful.  
Elk hunters had a slightly tougher go of it. Statewide, they drove, hiked and glassed an average of 19 days to successfully harvest a wapiti. Nearly 53% punched their tag.
It’s no secret that large carnivores, which occur at lower densities, are notoriously more difficult to locate, close in on and kill. Even aided by stinky bait — a common, legal tactic — Wyoming black bear hunters spent 66 days in the field per animal downed in 2023, the last year of available data. Success rates were starkly lower: Just 14%. 
Then there’s the wolf. 
Intelligent, relatively sparse in population, and often aided by many sets of packmate eyeballs to spot threats, wolves have proven exceptionally difficult to kill in parts of Wyoming where hunters are restricted to fair-chase tactics.
This graph shows hunter success rates and effort since Wyoming gained jurisdiction over its wolves in 2012. From 2014-2016, no hunt occurred because the state’s population was relisted under the Endangered Species Act. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)

Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist Ken Mills shared the data at a hunting season-setting meeting in Pinedale this week. During the 2023 season, the last year data was available, hunters in Wyoming’s trophy game area, where wolves are regulated, logged about 450 days per animal they managed to kill. Success rates registered at 2.7%. (Mills is still sussing out the numbers from the 2024 wolf hunt, though he expects an uptick in success.)
At least in Wyoming, those numbers are pretty typical, according to a graph the state agency’s longtime wolf biologist presented to four members of the public and a handful of colleagues. There was a time, he said, when wolves were smartening up to hunting pressure so well it was even a concern — hunter-days logged per wolf climbed from 300 to more than 500 between 2017 and 2021.

“If it continues to increase, there’s a lower probability that we’ll be able to use fair-chase hunting as a management tool,” Mills said. “If wolves are learning so much, and avoiding hunting so well, we’re going to have [a] low harvest and we’re not going to be able to attain our [target population] objectives.” 
For that reason, he said, improvements in success and days spent hunting per kill from 2022 to 2024 were “actually really good” to see.
“OK, fair-chase hunting is working,” Mills explained of his thinking. “It’s still a good tool to be able to manage wolf numbers, which is certainly my preference.” 
In Montana and Idaho, the only other Lower 48 states that currently hunt wolves, wildlife managers tasked by their state legislatures with killing more wolves have shifted gears, adopting tactics like trapping, snaring and night-hunting with thermal imagery that have remained prohibited in Wyoming’s wolf trophy game area. (In Wyoming’s predator zone, encompassing 85% of the state, virtually anything goes, even running over wolves with snowmobiles.)

It’s unclear based on easily accessible data how hunter success in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming’s wolf predator zone compares to the numbers Mills presented from the tightly regulated trophy game area. During the 2023-’24 wolf season in Montana, roughly 1.6% of hunting and trapping license holders killed a wolf, but the harvest report doesn’t track hunter effort. Idaho, likewise, doesn’t provide hunting effort data in its wolf harvest report, though at one point in the past, license-holder success was as low as 0.4% in the Gem State. 
In Wyoming, the wealth of data also provides some insight into the types of animals the lucky few successful hunters are ultimately pulling the trigger on. Especially early in the season, the preponderance of animals killed are young: either that year’s pups, yearlings or 2-year-olds. 
“About a third of the wolves taken in September were juveniles, and that declines through time,” Mills said. 
The majority of wolves killed in Wyoming’s hunt are either pups, yearlings or 2 year olds, especially early in the season. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
Back in 2018, Game and Fish tacked on September to its wolf hunt. Shortly afterward, Mills recollected, officials bumped the start date back a couple of weeks to avoid killing pups on “rendezvous sites” — where the young of the year get stashed after leaving the den. 
The first six or so weeks of the Wyoming hunt — Sept. 15 through October — remain the easiest time of year to kill a wolf, the data shows. That’s because success increases when hunting localized wolves, like the youngsters tied to a rendezvous site. 
“Especially year to year, people figure out where wolves are hanging out,” Mills said. “They know where to go.” 
Wyoming’s 2025 wolf hunting season proposal would bring mostly modest changes from the 2024 season. The maximum number of wolves that could be killed would increase from 38 to 44 animals, though that must pass muster with the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission.
Stability in Wyoming’s wolf population and regulated wolf hunt have become the norm.

Joni Ernst held a town hall at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Parkersburg May 30, 2025. (Screenshot via C-SPAN)PARKERSBURG, IOWA — At a sometimes raucous town hall meeting Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst faced vocal opposition to her support for spending cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.
Like many other Republican lawmakers holding events with constituents throughout the country, Ernst faced a crowd at the Aplington-Parkersburg High School who were upset with decisions made by President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress — particularly as they relate to funding for health care and food assistance programs included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House earlier in May.
Though Ernst said the Senate would make changes to the measure and advance their own version of the legislation, she defended reductions in spending for Medicaid at the town hall, saying the changes will not impact people in need but will remove from the program “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and able-bodied adults who are not working.
“People will die,” a woman shouted at the stage as Ernst answered one of several questions about the cuts.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst said in a response that was met by further shouts and jeering from the crowd.
Ernst said she agrees with most of the provisions on Medicaid included in the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that it was targeted at changes to the public health care program that “made it much easier to get onto Medicaid, but much tougher to take people off of Medicaid.” Ernst said many people on Medicaid currently are working full-time and have access to other benefits.
“What we have to do is make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid,” Ernst said. “What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits. So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
In its House form, the bill includes a $625 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. It also includes 80-hour-per-month work requirements for people between ages 19 and 65 to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage, with several exceptions for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, pregnant people, tribal community members and parents of dependent children.
Elizabeth Kehret, who works for Lutheran Services in Iowa, said she was troubled by the potential impact of Medicaid cuts for pregnant woman, saying that she was previously enrolled on Medicaid during her four pregnancies before the state revised eligibility for postpartum coverage, changing it from families with incomes of 375% of the federal poverty line to those at 215% of the federal poverty line.
Kehret said she was concerned the federal Medicaid spending cuts would cause similar cuts for care in states across the country, meaning pregnant people, who may also have private health coverage, will struggle to pay for the medical care required both before and after their child is born.
“I heard you say earlier about people who work full time but still get Medicaid — yeah,” Kehret said. “I meet with dozens of women who have dual enrollment, where they have private insurance as well as Medicaid, and it helps cover the things that their private insurance doesn’t, or that high deductible. … Medicaid is extremely important to the smallest and most vulnerable population in Iowa.”
Ernst said there were provisions to allow continued Medicaid coverage for pregnant people in the House bill.
“Because you are part of that vulnerable population, we want to make sure that you have access to Medicaid,” Ernst said. “So you will hear examples of those like the able-bodied, 30-year-old man who is taking advantage of the program, not working. What we’re asking is that please engage in work activities, engage in volunteer activities, be enrolled in a training program, and then that makes you Medicaid eligible.”
Similar concerns were brought up about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. Under the House budget plan, some costs of SNAP would be moved to the states, in addition to adding other work requirements. Ernst said the House bill is correcting “overpayments” from states on SNAP, in addition to removing “people that have not been eligible for these programs by law as it is currently written” from public assistance.
Several veterans also spoke at the event, criticizing Republicans and Elon Musk’s DOGE Service for cuts to veterans’ assistance programs and cuts to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In response, Ernst said, “We’re not cutting veterans benefits.”
Several veterans have been outspoken about changes made by DOGE to the VA, including the cut of roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Ernst has been a major supporter of DOGE and efforts to make government more “efficient,” saying Republicans and Musk are focused on removing areas of unnecessary spending and “streamlining” existing programs and services. Ernst highlighted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an entity that can be made more efficient through DOGE efforts in response to a question on federal support following natural disasters.
“Department of Government Efficiency … the E is not about elimination, it is about efficiency,” Ernst said. “So how can we do better as a federal government to respond to the people on the ground?”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A federal judge has ruled in favor of intervening environmental groups and dismissed a lawsuit against a decades-old rule that connects wetland protections to federal farm benefits. 
The lawsuit, filed by CTM Holdings LLC against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, alleged the law, commonly known as “swampbuster,” is unconstitutional. In March, federal representatives and intervening environmental groups argued in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa that CTM Holdings had no standing in the case. 
The lawsuit arose when CTM Holdings sought to farm a 9-acre portion of property that had previously been designated a wetland. The company, which rents the property to farmers, alleged in the complaint that the USDA “unconstitutionally” conditions its farm benefits through swampbuster. The company also argued the wetlands in question were dry but the federal agency would not remove the wetland designation.

Iowa Farmers Union, Iowa Environmental Council, Dakota Rural Action, and Food & Water Watch intervened in the case in support of the USDA with the goal of upholding the swampbuster rule, which they argued protects water quality, habitat and land. 
Iowa Environmental Council attorney Michael Schmidt said swampbuster serves as a “foundational conservation practice” to protect wetlands and habitat, prevent flooding and improve water quality. 
“This court’s thorough decision upholds the practical conservation measures that have been the standard for decades,” Schmidt said in a statement. “Commonsense measures like Swampbuster support Iowa farmers and everyone downstream from them.”
Judge says plaintiff ‘repeatedly’ lacks the standing to bring ‘any of its claims’
The intervenors argued, and Chief Justice C.J. Williams upheld that CTM Holdings had not suffered injury from swampbuster, nor had the company “exhausted its administrative remedies,” such as asking for a redetermination of the area. 
In March, during oral arguments on a motion, legal counsel from Pacific Legal Foundation and Liberty Justice Center, on behalf of CTM Holdings, said the company requested a redetermination of the land by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, but said the agency hardly ever changes a determination. 
The counsel representing the USDA said the agency’s records do not show a request for redetermination. 
Union of Concerned Scientists pushes for wetland protections in Farm Bill

Williams agreed with the USDA and the intervenors following a review of the communications and forms between the USDA and CTM Holdings. 
“If plaintiff’s intention was to request a review of the 2010 wetlands determination, nobody else in the world could possibly have known it,” Williams wrote in the ruling, adding that the company’s alleged injury was not “actual or imminent” but rather a “speculative chain of possibilities.” 
If the 9-acre area was indeed no longer wetland and the company actually requested a redetermination of the land, Williams wrote that CTM Holdings should have “no problems.” 
Arguments of unconstitutionality fail
The lawsuit argued swampbusters, formally known as the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions of the 1985 Farm Bill, is unconstitutional for two reasons. 
First, it argued that government benefits cannot be conditioned. Per swampbuster, landowners must agree to avoid “any activity that alters natural wetlands” to remain eligible for USDA benefits like crop insurance and other subsidies farmers rely on. 
Williams wrote that the argument for unconstitutionality “misses the point” as it is framed in the suit. He explained that swampbuster is an “exercise” of Congress’ spending power, which may have conditions attached to it.

The complaint also alleged swampbuster is an unconstitutional “taking” of private land, and the requirement to avoid altering the property is akin to an unpaid easement. 
Williams rejected this argument as well, noting that CTM Holding does receive reimbursement for the wetland area in the form of USDA benefits. Additionally, he noted that property owners can still do “many things” to the designated wetland while complying with the law, including logging, which CTM Holdings did. 
Williams dismissed the case “with prejudice” meaning it cannot be refiled at a later date. 
Liberty Justice Center, one of the litigation firms representing CTM Holdings in the case, said the decision was “disappointing” but the group plans to appeal the case to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. 
“We’re confident that the appellate court will ultimately rule that this federal law is unconstitutional,” Liberty Justice Center said in a statement. “This law has been taking land from farmers for years, and we look forward to continuing to fight this unconstitutional law.” 
Aaron Lehman, president of the intervening Iowa Farmers Union, said he is “very happy” with the dismissal and believes the decision will be upheld, “no matter how far the plaintiffs want to take it.” 
“Farm programs need to have integrity,” Lehman said. “When we have voluntary participation in programs, we expect that it’s going to have conservation compliance attachments that make sense for the farm, make sense for the neighbors and (make) sense for the entire community.” 
Dani Replogle, a staff attorney with Food & Water Watch, said the decision is an “unequivocal victory” for sustainable farms and clean water. 
“The message is clear: we will not let fringe legal theories turn our wetlands into sacrifice zones for corporate landlords,” Replongle said in a statement.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A special session of the North Dakota Legislature is still up in the air as the attorney general reviews options to fix an error with a line-item veto.
Meanwhile, legislative leaders this week directed staff to do legal research on possible scenarios that would prompt the Legislature to come back into session, including a recent appeals court ruling that affects legislative districts.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s general counsel has asked for an attorney general’s opinion on his line-item veto of Senate Bill 2014. Armstrong’s veto message only indicated he objected to a $150,000 grant, but the message was accompanied by red lines crossing out a section of the bill that also included $35 million for the Housing Incentive Fund.
North Dakota governor unintentionally vetoes $35 million for housing programs

Attorney Chris Joseph wrote in his request for an opinion that the red marking “merely serves as a color-coded visual aid.” He asked for an opinion on whether the governor’s written veto message or the visual pen marks on the bill satisfy the constitutional requirements of a line-item veto.
Mike Nowatzki, spokesman for the governor, said the opinion will determine the next steps. 
Armstrong previously said he would call lawmakers back for a special session if necessary to correct the mistake. Legislative Council estimates a special session would cost $65,000 per day.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said Wednesday during a meeting of Legislative Management that he asked Legislative Council staff to brief legislative leaders on scenarios that might prompt lawmakers to reconvene.
One question Hogue raised is whether the Legislature has a duty to act in response to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that overturned a 2023 district court ruling that found the state’s 2021 redistricting plan unlawfully diluted the voting power of Native American voters. A federal judge had ordered the Legislature to change its district map, but if the appellate court’s ruling stands, the state would revert back to the 2021 plan. The plaintiffs, which include the Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, have asked for a rehearing before the full 8th Circuit.
Hogue also asked staff to provide a legal briefing related to the governor’s vetoes and whether that would prompt legislators to reconvene. Armstrong issued seven line-item vetoes on six bills after the session adjourned. 
Previously, Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said a special session was the only obvious legal remedy to fix the error with the veto, but he said this week his staff continue to research the issue.
Other situations that might prompt the Legislature to reconvene are a significant drop in the price of oil that changes the state’s budget outlook or federal funding cuts that have major impacts to state or local subdivisions, Hogue said.
If lawmakers call themselves back into session, they have six remaining days of their 80-day limit. If Armstrong calls a special session, that would not affect the 80-day limit.

(Main photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A Quad-City social worker who was fired after refusing to be tested for intoxication at work has been sanctioned by state regulators.
The Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals recently charged social worker Jaime L. Roggenbauer of Bettendorf with knowingly making misleading or untrue statements in the practice of social work, or engaging in unethical conduct harmful to the public, by attempting to practice social work while intoxicated. The board also accused her of interfering with her previous employer’s information technology systems.
According to the board, Roggenbauer had provided counseling services at a children’s advocacy center located in Rock Island, Illinois, since January 2022. She was fired on March 19, 2024, the day her co-workers reported that she appeared chatty, animated and unsteady — a departure from her typical demeanor.

The board alleges that Roggenbauer was fired after she refused a chemical test for intoxication. According to the board, she then changed the password to the center’s therapy documentation system, which locked other part-time providers out of the center’s database.
Roggenbauer denied the allegations, but to resolve the case she recently agreed to a settlement that entails her license being placed on probation for two years, during which time she will work with a practice monitor.
Court records show that in 2022, Roggenbauer was convicted of first-offense drunken driving.



Social workers charged with ethics violations
Other Iowans recently sanctioned by the Iowa Board of Behavioral Health Professionals include:
— Kelly Sachau of Sioux City, who is alleged to have maintained a relationship with a patient from April 2021 to the present. According to the board, the patient received therapy services from Sachau while the two maintained a personal relationship. In October 2022, Sachau ended her relationship with the practice group where she worked and took the patient’s therapy records and notes with her to her new practice without the patient’s written consent. She was charged with failing to comply with ethics guidelines related to patient boundaries and records.
Sachau denied having a dual relationship with the patient and denied improper handling of client records and information. To settle the case, she agreed to pay a $750 civil penalty and have her license placed on probation for two years during which time she will work with a practice monitor and complete training on ethics, clinical documentation and professional boundaries.
— Trisha Tonelli of Des Moines, who allegedly disclosed confidential information related to the care of a client. She was charged with failing to comply with ethics guidelines on confidentiality, and was issued a warning that similar conduct in the future could result in further disciplinary action. As part of her settlement agreement with the board, Tonelli agreed to complete six hours of ethics training.

(Getty Images)Utah has some of the best infrastructure in the country when compared to other states, although its canals and levees are in need of repair. 
That’s according to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ report card, released Thursday, which gives the Beehive State an overall C+ grade. That’s tied with Georgia and Wisconsin for the highest score of all U.S. states and territories. 
“A C+ means our infrastructure is meeting the needs of Utahns, but there’s still room for improvement,” said Craig Friant, a civil engineer who worked on the report. “This is a sign that we’re doing things well here in Utah.”
While the state has one of the highest grades, the rest of the country is not far behind. The national grade is C, and most states and territories received a C or C- grade — South Carolina and Louisiana each received a D+, West Virginia received a D and Puerto Rico received a D-, the lowest grade. 
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE, an A grade is defined as exceptional and fit for the future; B is good and adequate for now; C is mediocre, requiring attention; D is poor and at risk; and F is failing, requiring critical attention and unfit for purpose. 
The report lists 12 separate areas of infrastructure for each state. Consider Utah’s report: 

Aviation: C+
Bridges: B
Canals: D+ 
Dams: C+
Drinking water: B- 
Hazardous waste: C+ 
Levees: D- 
Roads: B+ 
Solid waste: B-
Stormwater: C 
Transportation: B- 
Wastewater: C 

The majority of the state’s levees and canals are old, according to the report — most levees are more than 60 years old, and many of the state’s canals were built in the 19th century for irrigation purposes.

The report also noted that data isn’t readily available for levees and canals, which poses another risk. 
“These are systems that protect households and businesses from flooding, yet we don’t know their condition in many cases, which is a major public safety hazard,” said Friant, who pointed to outdated levees in Salt Lake County that protect residential areas from flooding during runoff or storms. 
These levees don’t currently meet the Army Corps of Engineers standards, putting them at risk of being delisted — if that happens, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, could eventually reclassify the land surrounding the Salt Lake City International and Provo City airports as flood plains, according to the report. That could “drastically” alter how the land is assessed and insured, engineers say. 
Recommendations for improving Utah’s infrastructure
What can the state do to boost its grade? The report gives several recommendations, including more analysis and better funding when it comes to infrastructure. 
“Specifically, detailed written plans are critical for the areas of water resources, canals, transportation, transit, and waste management,” the report reads. “The state should be providing consistent financial support for project improvements, maintenance, resiliency, and risk reduction through reliable funding streams year after year that facilitate this planning.” 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Prioritizing funding for bridges is another recommendation. Even though Utah received a B, engineers say many of the state’s bridges are nearing the end of their “service lives.” 
The state should also increase funding for its Dam Safety Program. Utah currently has hundreds of dams considered “high hazard,” which means if they fail, it would cause severe damage and loss of life. 
That includes the Panguitch Lake Dam, which showed signs of seepage last year after cracks appeared near the top, likely the result of ice pushing up against the concrete. The roughly 1,700 residents of Panguitch were put on notice to prepare for evacuation, but crews were able to break the ice away and stabilize the dam. 
Utah has a big, expensive and potentially dangerous dam problem

To avoid a repeat scenario, the report recommends the state dump at least $10 million each year into the Dam Safety Program and try to rehabilitate all dams within 50 years. “An increase to $20 million per year would allow faster repairs but could still require 25 years for all required repairs,” the report reads. 
Bolstering “multi-modal” transportation options — like expanding bus or train networks —is another recommendation as the state deals with rapid population growth. 
And lastly, Utah should make sure the Great Salt Lake reaches and remains at healthy levels — replacing canals with pipelines will help reduce evaporation, and could ultimately result in more water flowing to the lake, according to the report.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-584917952-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

The Friday dismissal comes about six months after the chapter filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Louisville woman who, at the time, was pregnant and seeking an abortion. 
The woman, identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe, later traveled out of state for an abortion, which is illegal in Kentucky in most circumstances.

Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement that “decisions about health care are and should remain private, and we will not be providing additional details about the dismissal.
“People have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” Duke said. “We are strategizing our next steps in this fight. In the meantime, our work to address the commonwealth’s maternal mortality rates and lack of widespread paid leave coverage will continue as long as Kentucky remains a forced-birth state.”
Poe’s lawsuit was the fourth challenging Kentucky abortion laws since the United States Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that had protected the right to abortion for almost 50 years. The ruling triggered Kentucky’s ban into effect.
The first challenge, filed by abortion providers, advanced in Jefferson Circuit Court but was rejected on appeal.
In December, a woman filed a lawsuit similar to Poe’s challenge, stating she was pregnant and did not wish to be. Within days of filing her lawsuit, though, the pregnancy lost viability and she ended her challenge of the law.
In two cases, Kentucky courts, including the state Supreme Court, have rejected challenges to the ban on grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the action; the U.S. Supreme Court has likewise avoided ruling on the merits of abortion bans.

Gov. Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Jason White told reporters they’re planning to focus on K-12 education policy next year during the 2026 session. 
Hosemann, the Republican leader of the Senate, said he wants to pass legislation to give public school teachers a pay raise and find a way to allow retired teachers to work in the classroom again. 
“Without an educated workforce, Mississippi’s momentum will not continue,” Hosemann said at a press conference on Friday. 
State law sets the salary for public school teachers based on how much college education they have received and how long they have taught. The last time the Legislature raised teacher salaries was during the 2022 session. 
White, a Republican from West, conducted a press conference Friday, but he excluded some media outlets including Mississippi Today. But according to a recording of the press conference in his Capitol office, White intends to push lawmakers, again, to consider school choice legislation and will form a study committee to conduct hearings on the issue during the summer. 
“Our sister states surrounding us here in the South all have basically open enrollment now,” White said. “Now, are we ready to go that far? Do we have the votes to go that far? I don’t know that. But it’s time we have a real conversation about what is best for kids and parents and not the status quo or what might upset somebody somewhere.” 
Full school choice policies typically give state dollars to families and allow them to use that money for their child’s K-12 education, regardless of whether they attend a public or private school. But it’s unclear if White would push for full school choice or a more moderate measure.
Earlier this year, the speaker pushed the House to vote for a bill that allows students in D and F-rated districts to transfer to another school, public or private. However, the bill died on a legislative deadline without a vote from the entire House. 
The House also passed a public-to-public “open enrollment” bill to allow students to transfer to a public school district located outside of the district they live. But a Senate committee killed the measure without bringing it up for a vote.
Mississippi currently has a very limited form of “open enrollment” that allows students to transfer from their home district to a nearby school district. However, the transfer requires the approval of both the home and receiving school districts. 
The House’s proposal would have prevented the home district from blocking the student’s transfer. 
Hosemann on Friday said he was personally in favor of both of those proposals, but he was unsure if a majority of the Senate would vote for the measures. 
Other priorities White outlined were: 

Continuing to focus on improving the city of Jackson, especially the capital city’s water and sewer systems 
Reforming the public employee retirement system 

Hosemann’s other priorities include: 

Restructuring government agencies and their office space 
Banning student cell phones in public K-12 schools

""My time as a special government employee necessarily had to end — it was a limited time thing, it’s 134 days I believe, which ends in a few days. So it comes with a time limit. But the DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger.”Musk then compared his initiative to Buddhism, a religion practiced by hundreds of millions of people, saying DOGE jobs were “like a way of life” that he hoped would permeate throughout the federal government.DOGE’s efforts so far have led to about $160 billion in spending cuts, Musk said. That’s a small fraction of the $6.8 trillion the federal government spent during the most recent fiscal year and short of the goal he set before joining the administration.Musk said DOGE was “relentlessly pursuing” at least $1 trillion in spending cuts to benefit American taxpayers, shortly after pointing out a golden eagle on the ceiling of the Oval Office that Trump said used to be plaster.“Nobody ever really saw it. They didn't know the eagle was up there, and we highlighted it,” Trump said. “Essentially it’s a landmark, a great landmark, and that's 24-karat gold. And everybody loved it. Now, they all see it when they come in. So it's been good.”Musk hailed Trump for ensuring the Oval Office “finally has the majesty that it deserves."" Neither man shared how much was spent to redesign the eagle.Musk plans to refocus his professional efforts on his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.New York Times story on Musk drug useTrump said he “hopes” that Musk continues to advise him on government issues, even though he will no longer be employed by the White House.Republican lawmakers, Trump said, are “totally committed to making the DOGE cuts permanent and stopping much more of the waste in the months to come.”“We want to get our great, big, beautiful bill finished and done,” Trump said, referring to a tax and spending cuts package the House passed earlier this month. “We put some of this into the bill, but most of it's going to come later. We're going to have it (codified) by Congress, affirmed by Congress. In some cases, we’ll make cuts, in some cases we'll just use it in a different layer to save the money. But it's hundreds of billions of dollars.”Musk declined to answer a question about a bombshell New York Times report published earlier in the day that detailed his ongoing use of drugs, including ketamine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms.Trump desires bigger tax cuts from SenateTrump said during the press conference he hopes the U.S. Senate amends the “big, beautiful bill” by cutting more government spending, without specifying which programs.That package would cut about $1.5 trillion in federal funding for several programs during the next decade, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its full analysis of the package next week, including how changes made just before the bill went to the floor will impact state budgets and people’s access to safety net programs.Trump also called on senators to further lower taxes in the package,“It's an unbelievable bill…It cuts, you know, it's a huge cutting,” Trump said. “But there's things I'd like to see, maybe cut a little bit more. I'd like to see a bigger cut in taxes. It's going to be the largest tax decrease or cut in the history of our country. I'd like to see it get down to an even lower number. I was shooting for a slightly lower number. I would have liked to have done that.”Trump appeared to renew his call for Congress to completely eliminate the debt limit, even though the tax and spending cuts package would raise that ceiling by $4 trillion.""I agree with Elizabeth Warren on that. I think we should get rid of it,” Trump said, referring to the Democratic senator from Massachusetts. “It's too catastrophic.”",,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Members of the House Committee on Finance on Thursday appeared to see the need for a bill that would let municipalities impose a $2 tax on tickets to large venue events despite opposition from event promoters and business owners.
Providence Democratic Rep. Rebecca Kislak introduced her bill with a shout-out to her mom in Miami by recounting her mother’s words: “‘Why are you in the news about this ticket tax? What’s the big deal? All big metropolitan areas and cities have taxes like this to support the cities where events are held.’ So thanks, Mom, for that.”  
Kislak’s H6334 was submitted at the request of the Providence City Council as part of a multipronged approach to fend off budget chaos following a multimillion dollar settlement last November between the city and the state education department. Kislak is also the sponsor of H6162,  by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley, which would allow the city to increase its total tax levy in fiscal year 2026 beyond the state-mandated 4% growth cap. 
The tax levy bill passed the House floor 56-17 Tuesday after about an hour of heated discussion, with House Republicans joining progressive Democrats in opposing the bill’s passage. The legislation lingers still in the Senate, where it was heard in committee for the first time, also on Tuesday. 
Kislak’s event ticket tax bill bears the signature of at least one Providence Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. David Morales, who opposed the levy bill, plus five other Providence Democrats, and Democratic Reps. Brandon Potter of Cranston and June Speakman of Warren.
While the bill was designed with Providence in mind, it would authorize any municipality to adopt a local tax of up to $2 per ticket on events held at “large venues,” or those with 800 or more seats, per the bill’s definition. The Division of Taxation would be responsible for collecting the tax and then redistributing it to municipalities.
Revenue from ticket taxes would not count toward the tax levy hike cap codified in state law. That complements the tax levy hike legislation, by allowing towns and cities to up their tax income without risking the chance of going over the 4% annual limit on how much municipalities can raise taxes.    
“Every city and town, increasingly, is facing difficulties in overreliance on property tax as the main workhorse for how we can do our business, how we can take care of city services,” Providence City Council President Rachel Miller told the committee Thursday, adding that the bill “is one kind of tool in the toolbox” to help dig the city out of its fiscal hole.
Miller estimated the new fee could generate around $3 million annually for Providence, which would help offset the rising cost of services in the capital city without discouraging event attendance.
The bill was held for further study Thursday, as is standard practice.
City Council Chief of Staff June Rose said in an email Friday that a Senate companion is in the works.
Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Mayor Smiley, said the city administration is still reviewing the bill. 
The state’s Division of Taxation has read the bill, however, and thinks it needs to be redrafted. In a letter to the committee, Neena Savage, tax administrator, testified that parts of the bill as written are “ambiguous” and suggested filing it under local tax statutes rather than the state’s broader sales tax code. 
Asked about the tax official’s take, Kislak said via text Friday that she was planning to review everything over the weekend, and “would be glad to provide additional clarifications based on the feedback last night.” 
“This is enabling legislation and I’m confident the cities and towns will refine this in locally appropriate ways as they write ordinances, if they so choose,” Kislak wrote.

Concerns about competition
Kislak’s bill managed to coalesce support among her colleagues. It also did the same for the opposition — venue managers and hospitality lobbyists — who showed up Thursday night to oppose the bill, many of whom argued that the proposed fee is small, it will disadvantage Rhode Island in a competitive live entertainment market.
“It’s not so much about passing it on to the patron,” said Dan Schwartz, general manager of The VETS Auditorium. “You know, what we hear when bills like this come up is, ‘We’re just going to skip bringing our show to Rhode Island.’”
Written testimonies opposing the legislation also came from the legal counsel for the Providence Bruins, South Kingstown Town Councilor Jay G. Wégimont, and Joseph Paolino Jr., former Providence mayor and noted downtown real estate magnate.
“This legislation targets the very institutions that help drive Providence’s economic engine, and at the worst possible time,” Paolino wrote, adding that his luxury hotel The Beatrice is always booked when a popular show or game is in town. 
Contrasting the naysayers was the Finance Committee, including a relentless Rep. Teresa Tanzi. The South Kingstown Democrat asked many questions of the industry advocates who came to testify, although she was befuddled as to why they even showed up.  
“This $2 thing — I’m shocked that you guys are even here opposing it, to be quite honest with you,” Tanzi said. “Because in the larger scheme of things, your ticket holders are being ripped off on so many other levels, and the city is being inconvenienced on so many other levels.”
Tanzi suggested that if proprietors were truly concerned about ticket prices, they would investigate different options for ticket delivery — like Dice, a platform that allows people to resell tickets only at face value, and only through its own app, rather than secondary markets.
Tanzi also grilled Lawrence Lepore, the general manager of the Amica Mutual Pavilion. Tanzi asked Lepore to what extent the state subsidizes its largest concert venue at 14,000 seats. Lepore replied it’s about $27 million a year, including debt service. 
“So you’re not self-sustaining anyway,” Tanzi said.
“The operation is self-sustaining. But of course, the debt service is not,”  Lepore replied.
“We subsidize it to a tune of $27 million a year?” Tanzi asked.
“That’s correct,” Lepore said, and Tanzi concluded with a “Thank you. Thank you very much.”

Taxpayers subsidize big venues
Rich Lupo sold his titular concert venue in 2017, but the longtime music promoter warned that Providence is already “a secondary city in the booking world.”
“[This bill] would just piss them off,” Lupo said of booking companies. “I think it could be $1, it could be $10. You just don’t want to anger the powerful agencies, and bands as well.”
From his seat on the committee, bill co-sponsor Hull was canny with Lupo, pointing out that he’s known him for decades, and fondly recalls how Lupo grew his titular venue since opening it in 1975.    
“I’ve seen what you’re capable of doing,” Hull told Lupo.
That’s why Hull was firm that the businesses should be capable of weathering a $2 surcharge — especially places like the Amica Mutual Pavilion, which is housed in the tax-exempt Rhode Island Convention Center but still benefits from city services.  
Sharon Steele, speaking on behalf of the Jewelry District Association, disagreed. She pointed to another Smiley proposal and Kislak bill for a 7% “consumption tax” on the city’s parking lots and garages. The ticket tax would add “insult to injury” for downtown venues already burdened by tax policies, she said.
Hull told Steele he subscribes to the Rhode Island Philharmonic — Steele was once on its board — then narrowed his eyes, smiled, and made a case for the value of expression: “The arts are special. And if I had to pay an extra $2 to see the arts, I’d be more than happy to pay it.” 
“I appreciate that, but the Philharmonic’s not doing well these days,” Steele said, adding that such plights are common right now for nonprofits. “And we’re sure not getting any help from the feds.”
“The $2 is necessary,” Hull replied.

(Courtesy photo)It remained unclear on Friday who will become the treasurer for New Mexico’s ruling political party, following the previous treasurer’s resignation after just one month on the job.
Julie Rochman, of Albuquerque, resigned as treasurer for the Democratic Party of New Mexico on Wednesday, in a resignation letter addressed to all of the party’s members, who elected her and the rest of its leadership on April 26.
Rochman wrote she is concerned DPNM’s officers don’t reflect New Mexico’s diversity. Including herself, three of the four officers are not originally from New Mexico, two are older white women, one comes from a rural area and none speak Spanish, she wrote.
“Most distressing to me, in our minority-majority Hispanic state, is DPNM’s lack of a single Hispanic executive,” Rochman wrote. “This is a glaring deficit and strategic negligence.”
Rochman wrote the party should replace her with “someone who represents the very people we’ve overlooked for too long — ideally a Hispanic leader rooted in a rural space.”
DPNM spokesperson Daniel Garcia told Source NM on Friday party rules do not determine a timeline for replacing its treasurer, however, “DPNM wants to move expeditiously in finding a replacement to fulfill the position’s work without interruption.”
The new treasurer will be selected by the party’s officers, Garcia said, including Chair Sara Attleson, Vice Chair Cam Crawford, Secretary Brenda Hoskie and the three congressional district vice chairs. 
“Right now there are not specific individuals under consideration, but the process will be conducted in a thorough, transparent process,” Garcia said.
Rochman wrote that Attleson and Crawford “have squashed efforts for all officers to work together as a team” and “intentionally excluded” her.
“They don’t inform or engage with me,” Rochman wrote. “In short, they’ve made clear that my expertise and input are unwelcome.”
In a statement, Attleson denied Rochman’s allegations that she wasn’t welcome in the party, and defended its leaders’ diversity.
“Contrary to her letter, we welcomed Julie to be a part of the movement we’re building,” Attleson said. “Unfortunately, shortly after the election, she decided this team wasn’t an ideal fit for her.”
Attleson pointed to the majority of New Mexico’s statewide and federal elected leaders being Hispanic, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, along with several of the congressional district vice chairs.
Rochman told Source NM it is great that so many elected officials in New Mexico are Hispanic, “but it doesn’t excuse the fact that the party doesn’t look like the state.”
Attleson also pointed to Crawford’s background as a young Black man, and Hoskie’s membership in the Navajo Nation and fluency in Diné.
“New Mexico Democrats proudly draw our strength from our diversity, which is apparent in our leadership,” Attleson said. “At a time when billionaires are dictating public policy and Donald Trump is eliminating essential services, we have to stay focused on fighting for working class New Mexicans, not turning on each other.”
‘Trumpian’ nondisclosure agreement refused
Rochman wrote that she received a nondisclosure agreement in late May after weeks of no communication about ongoing party affairs and strategic planning. Rochman told Source NM in an interview that Sean Ward, the party’s executive director, asked her to sign it.
A copy of the unsigned NDA shows it would have barred Rochman from saying or doing anything that would damage the reputation of any of the party’s officers, staff or volunteers.
Rochman wrote in her letter that the NDA is inconsistent with her values and undermines her right to free speech and her obligation to speak truth to power.
“Essentially, it would be a gag order for the rest of my life,” she wrote.
Rochman told Source NM that she feels the document’s non-disparagement language “was very targeted” at her because she doesn’t get along with Attleson.
“It seemed very Trumpian to me,” Rochman said. “There had been some other things that were rather Trumpian, and I just didn’t want to be associated with an administration that was going to govern that way.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s tenure as a special government employee in the White House came to an end Friday, prompting Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost to say that his efforts reveal that a “corporate slash and burn mentality is not how you run a country.”
Musk had been leading the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which, according to its website, last updated on May 26, saved taxpayers an estimated $175 billion. However, one watchdog website tracking the cuts says it was more like $16 billion.
  Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
But there were significant cuts that have been damaging, including to international medical and food assistance programs. “The legacy will be a dark legacy,” Frost told a Phoenix reporter on Friday during an interview on WMNF-88.5 FM in Tampa.
Among the first and most prominent budget cancellations that came from DOGE was to dissolve the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has funded the majority of U.S. humanitarian and development assistance worldwide to people. That included stopping funding to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an HIV prevention program that has operated through USAID since 2003.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that it was “a lie” to say that anybody around the world has died because of the USAID cuts. However, through a modelling program, a research team at Boston University that studies infectious diseases has estimated that the loss of lives from USAID cuts stands at more than 300,000 worldwide, with more than 200,000 of those being children.
“These USAID cuts are devastating,” Frost said. “Global health is important to health here. The projections on HIV on how that is going to explode globally … and we could see an epidemic of HIV again in the United States over the coming years because of the way that  people travel.”
A study published this week by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that the Trump administration and DOGE have implemented new phone service restrictions that the Social Security Administration estimates will require people to make nearly 2 million additional trips to understaffed Social Security field offices every year.
“I’ve been speaking with folks who receive disability from SSI [Supplemental Security Income] who literally [say] the wait times are longer than they’ve ever been,” Frost said. “People are dying, waiting for the benefits that they deserve. And so these cuts were not made in good faith.”
Codifying DOGE
Musk and other conservatives like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have bemoaned that President Trump’s major tax and spending bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week doesn’t codify the spending cuts made by DOGE over the past four months. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson says that Congress will vote to codify those cuts of up to $9 billion in a bill that will soon be introduced in the House.
“People are seeing impacts now, but they’ll see impacts years into the future as well,” says Frost. “I think this bill that Johnson is bringing to codify some of the DOGE cuts in part is meant to placate Elon. It’s why the bill is coming up at the exact moment that he is leaving.”
While progressives like Frost hailed Musk’s departure from Washington, Florida Republicans were celebrating his accomplishments Friday afternoon.
“Under @elonmusk, @DOGE has done a phenomenal job identifying and helping cancel waste, fraud, and abuse from government,” said Southwest Florida Congressman and 2026 gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds on X. “As we carry out the annual appropriations process this summer, Congress must follow the lead of DOGE and eliminate this egregious spending once and for all.”
“Just like he launched @SpaceX beyond the stars, @elonmusk propelled @DOGE into orbit — leading the charge to cut waste, fraud, and abuse at hypersonic speed,” said Jacksonville U.S. Rep. Aaron Bean on X. “His vision for transparency and accountability will continue to reshape government spending and push for real fiscal responsibility. The mission isn’t slowing down — it’s only gaining altitude!”
‘Special government employee’
In his announcement reintroducing legislation this week that would require federal agencies and departments to verify the eligibility of individuals 105 years of age or older for federal benefits. Sarasota area U.S. Rep. Greg Steube credited DOGE for bringing attention to the issue.
“No American who has paid into Social Security and Medicare should see their benefits compromised by scam artists or incompetent bureaucrats,” Rep. Steube said in a statement. “It shouldn’t have required DOGE examining the rolls to ensure 12 million Americans listed as 120 years old or more were finally properly recorded as deceased.”
(The Associated Press reported earlier this year that Musk’s claims that “tens of millions” of dead people receiving Social Security checks was “overstated.”)
As a “special government employee,” Musk was forced to end his tenure at the White House on Friday because federal law says such employees are appointed to perform temporary duties “for a period not to exceed 130 days during any period of 365 days.”
Frost said that Musk’s temporary status as a federal employee was “misused” and predicted that “when Democrats take back the House we’re going to have to put some guardrails on that designation because it was misused for Elon Musk.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 20:54:03+00:00,CT Mirror,CT approves unemployment benefits for strikers; veto expected,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-unemployment-benefits-striking-workers/,Passing the bill despite Lamont’s promised veto reflects the influence of organized labor and Democrats’ desire to be recorded on the issue.,"A bill that would add Connecticut to the short list of states providing jobless benefits to strikers won final passage Friday, an organized labor victory muted by Gov. Ned Lamont’s promised veto.
The unusual decision by House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, to allot scarce time for a bill opposed by the governor reflects the influence of organized labor and desires of the House Democratic majority caucus to be recorded on the issue.
“It’s a big policy implication for a large swath of the caucus on an issue that you know they feel passionate about, particularly in light of the national federal government’s changes to the ability to collectively bargain,” Ritter said.
Lamont, a Democrat who has twice been elected with significant labor support, and the House Republican minority said removing the prohibition on strikers from getting unemployment benefits is a distinction Connecticut cannot afford as it tries to improve its economy and shed an anti-business reputation.
“I support the right to organize. I’m going to oppose any efforts to interfere with that right coming out of Washington, D.C.,” Lamont said. “If you want to make sure this is a state that grows and adds good paying jobs for people, I don’t think that striking worker bill is the way to go.”
The promised veto is a source of friction with labor as the governor nears an expected decision on whether to seek a third term as governor, something 60% of Democrats favor, according to a University of New Hampshire poll.
Connecticut is one of the most highly unionized states in the U.S., but overall membership has faltered since the 1980s, especially among private-sector workers. Only 6.7% of private-sector workers are unionized in the state, compared to 67% of state and municipal employees.
Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, said the labor federation still hoped Lamont might reconsider his veto, but the passage by the General Assembly would be significant nonetheless as unions look for ways to show influence in a difficult time for labor.
“In Connecticut, we need to lead. And, you know, the labor movement in Connecticut is strong, and we need to show the rest of the nation what you know our values are,” Hawthorne said.
Connecticut has been early in other labor advances that took root elsewhere, notably the nation’s first mandate on private employers to offer sick days or other paid time off, a paid family and medical leave program, and an hourly minimum wage exceeding $16.
Labor advocates say the strikers’ benefits bill is a necessary counter to the advantages most employers have at the bargaining table, especially since the Trump administration has left the National Labor Relations Board with insufficient members to act and shrunk the ranks of labor mediators.
“This really is a fight against the Donald Trump administration,” Hawthorne said. “It’s more important than ever, because we don’t have a backstop right now. You saw it in the Pratt & Whitney strike.”
The International Association of Machinists recently ended a 23-day strike at the jet-engine manufacturer. The union says if Connecticut had strikers’ benefits, the settlement would have come sooner.
In a letter to lawmakers urging the rejection of Senate Bill 8, the company’s parent, RTX Corporation, asserted that the opposite was true.
“The just-completed Pratt strike underscores this,” wrote Peter Holland, the vice president for state and local government relations. “It’s reasonable to assume employees would have withheld their labor much longer, holding out for a more valuable offer from Pratt.”
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said the House debate Friday was a dangerous, if confusing, political gesture by Democrats.
“Obviously we scratch our heads over spending a day on a striking workers bill that we know the governor wants to veto,” Candelora said. “We think it certainly sends the wrong message to our business community. Even the fact that we’re taking that bill up is really dangerous.”
Candelora noted that Pratt has manufacturing plants outside of Connecticut.
“I think that bill goes well beyond politics,” he said. “I am really concerned the same way the governor is concerned of the message that it sends to our business community and the impact it could actually have.”
Hawthorne agreed the bill sends a message but not the one articulated by Candelora and the governor.
“There’s a clear choice with this bill on who you stand with when you show up to a picket line,” Hawthorne said. “Are you standing with the workers? Or are you standing with the CEOs that have forced them out there?”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7657-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

Festivals, shows and parties celebrating LGBTQ+ Vermonters are happening from Springfield to Newport this June.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAnytime the Savoy Theater in Montpelier shows the Rocky Horror Picture Show, they’re cleaning up the theater for weeks, according to the theater’s marketing director, Leah Fishman. The cult classic features audience participation moments, including $5 prop bags full of messy objects like handfuls of uncooked rice. But Fishman said the cleanup was well worth the trouble. “It takes weeks, but we never regret it. It’s always so fun,” she said. Rocky Horror is one of six cinematic events planned for the theater’s Queer Film Festival, a three-week-long celebration of LGBTQ+ films and shorts, both modern and classic. The festival, now in its fourth year, is one of Vermont’s many events celebrating Pride Month this June. Pride Month events stretch all the way from Springfield to Newport, along with Bethel, Rutland, Morrisville, Barre and Essex, according to the Pride Center of Vermont. It kicks off two days early with Montpelier Pride on Friday, which includes a parade, music on the Statehouse lawn and street art. Just don’t look for Burlington on the list of June events: Vermont’s largest city has its annual Pride event scheduled for September, according to the Pride Center. Along with town-sponsored events, local venues have planned a wide variety of Pride-themed entertainment. Barre LGBTQ+ bar Foxy’s has an amateur drag night slated for June 7, while Babes Bar in Bethel has Gay Trivia planned on June 26 with the motto “Anyone can play but it’s gonna be gay.”One of Savoy’s screenings has a Babes Bar tie-in: “One Night at Babes,” the first of its Queer Shorts events, depicts the bar’s connections to the LGBTQ+ community and its rural neighbors, Fishman said.Another film at the festival, the surreal trans allegory “I Saw the TV Glow,” had its Vermont premiere at the Green Mountain Film Festival in 2024, but the Savoy never had the chance to screen it. Montpelier Pride was held on the lawn of the Statehouse in Montpelier on Friday, May 30. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“We’ve had it sort of in our back pocket for a while, hoping for a chance and sort of saving it for Pride,” Fishman said. Fishman said the film festival was inspired by the love of “queer cinema” among Savoy staff members, some of whom are LGBTQ+ themselves. “We’re looking for a way to sort of share and bring new people and new voices into the theater,” she said. “Whether that be through highlighting new filmmakers or sharing stories that they love, that perhaps the community hasn’t seen yet, or engaging folks in the community in a new way and really celebrating queer voices.”Kell Arbor, health and wellness director for the Pride Center, helped select the films this year and chose ones that would bring out a mix of “the youths and the elders.” A portion of ticket sales will go to the Pride Center as well.Along with helping to organize Montpelier’s pride events, Arbor plans to be “DJ Kell” at a pride-themed silent disco just over the border in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on June 16. Arbor, whose pronouns are fae/faer, said the Pride Month festivities were even more essential this year as the Trump administration rolled back federal funding for HIV prevention and other LGBTQ+ health care in Vermont. “It’s hard to come in joy and pleasure when we’re living in such trauma, pain and grief — and, we need it more than ever, and the brighter we’re beaconing, the more it’s helping other people feel like they’re not alone,” fae said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Queer Film Fest kicks off Pride Month in central Vermont.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/montpelier-pride-1-20250530-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 18:06:14.949870
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 20:50:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Connecticut leaders respond to ‘sanctuary’ designation by federal government,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-trump-sanctuary-jurisdiction/,Six CT cities and the state itself were on the Trump administration’s list of ‘sanctuary jurisdictions’ publicly released on Thursday night.,"When Mayor Justin Elicker learned that New Haven was on a list of six “sanctuary cities” designated by the federal government in Connecticut, he said he wasn’t surprised. 
“This is something we expected, and we are proud of it. New Haven is proudly a welcoming city. It’s one of our defining characteristics and values,” Elicker said at a press conference on Friday. 
On Thursday night, the Department of Homeland Security released a list of over 500 cities, counties and states that the agency deems “sanctuary jurisdictions.” Included on that list are six Connecticut cities — East Haven, New Haven, Windham, New London, Hartford and Hamden — and the state of Connecticut itself. 
“Sanctuary city” does not have a clear legal definition, but the Trump Administration defines it as areas that “obstruct the enforcement of Federal immigration laws, according to the federal government’s website. 
“Sanctuary jurisdictions including cities, counties, and states that are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities. Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril,” a press release from the department reads. 
State leaders and local elected officials from the six cities have responded to the designation in a variety of ways: with pride, confusion and denial. 
“That’s a mystery to me. I really have no idea where [President Donald Trump] is coming from,” Mayor Michael Passero of New London told the Connecticut Mirror on Friday. 
Passero said New London has always followed federal and state law. He said a person’s immigration status isn’t relevant to local law enforcement, and it’s not their policy to ask. But he said that shouldn’t qualify the city as a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” 
Passero said New London, which has always considered itself welcoming to immigrants, may not fit with Trump’s idea of what America should look like. 
“New London has always been, for 400 years, a multicultural city, because we’re a seaport,” he said, adding that his own parents were immigrants. 
Mayors Lauren Garrett of Hamden and Arunan Arulampalam of Hartford underscored the variety of backgrounds that make up their cities’ populations and criticized the federal government’s statements.  
“Hamden is a place that prides itself on diversity, we respect all of our neighbors, and we are in complete compliance with state and federal law. We will not be bullied by a federal administration that clearly does not understand how the law works, nor will we play into their game of shifting focus away from their campaign of defunding essential public services,” Garrett wrote in a statement. 
Arulampalam said in a statement that he was committed to “ensuring that every resident, regardless of where they come from or what their story is, has the opportunity to succeed.”
“While my administration remains laser-focused on real solutions that protect our community, it is clear that current federal policies do not share this commitment to safety and threaten to undermine the gains we have made,” Arulampalam added.
Mayor Joseph Carfora of East Haven called the designation “absurd” and “baseless.” He said the town planned to reach out to the Department of Homeland Security “to understand how such an unfounded statement was made without any consultation or communication with our office.” 
State Officials Respond
Both Attorney General William Tong and Gov. Ned Lamont said the Trump administration’s claim that Connecticut had “self-identified” as a sanctuary jurisdiction was false. 
“There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. That is a meaningless term,” Tong said in a statement. 
But Republican lawmakers pointed to the legislature’s recent passage of a bill that will expand the state’s Trust Act — Connecticut’s law outlining the circumstances under which local and state officials may work and communicate with the federal government’s efforts to detain unauthorized migrants. The bill received final passage earlier this week; Lamont has not yet signed it.
“It’s no surprise the Department of Homeland Security labeled Connecticut and several of its communities as ‘sanctuary jurisdictions,’” House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said in a statement on Friday. “Democrats in the legislature have taken extreme positions, expanding the Trust Act far beyond its original purpose of protecting victims and maintaining safety. Instead, it now shields illegal immigrants who are endangering our communities.”
The current Trust Act, which was passed in 2019, generally prohibits Connecticut law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up — with some exceptions.
Local law enforcement and corrections officials in Connecticut may only comply with a federal detainer request if ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if the person in their custody has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a class A or B felony — crimes like murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and first-degree manslaughter.
House Republicans drafted a letter to Lamont earlier this week asking that he veto the Trust Act expansion, which allows individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law, but also adds 13 new crimes to the list of those for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request. 
In the letter, Republicans said they felt the law “too often protects individuals who pose real threats to our communities, rather than promoting safety and cooperation.”
Senate Minority Leader Steven Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, referred to Connecticut in a statement as a “super sanctuary state” and said the expanded Trust Act would “further hinder federal law enforcement and burden property taxpayers.”
But House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he didn’t think the “sanctuary” designation should change the legislature’s decision to go forward with the Trust Act expansion. He said lawmakers had discussions with immigration advocates about trying to ensure the bill didn’t result in retaliation from the federal government, which could hurt the same people the bill was trying to help. 
“ But at the end of the day, you can’t totally compromise on your values because of political threats and intimidation,” Rojas told CT Mirror. 
Rojas said he didn’t have an opinion about the “sanctuary state” designation. “ I think about the people who are just trying to live their lives, raise their families, go to work. If there’s a level of confidence that we can give them that they’re welcome here, I think we should do that,” he said. 
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said in a statement that Connecticut was not a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“The Trump Administration is continues to use divisive language to frighten and confuse people,” Ritter said. 
Lamont spokesperson Rob Blanchard said Lamont plans to sign the Trust Act expansion that lawmakers approved. 
“Connecticut’s Trust Act, which was originally bipartisan, is consistent with federal constitutional standards and reflects sound public safety priorities. I am focused on making sure people feel safe in our schools, churches, and elsewhere. Nothing about this makes Connecticut a ‘sanctuary’ in any legal or practical sense – it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said in a statement. 
Elicker said at the press conference that he, too, wanted New Haven residents to feel safe going about their lives. 
“We want our residents to be comfortable calling the police to report a crime… we want our residents to seek out healthcare should they need it. We want to make sure our immigrant children are comfortable and safe going to school,” Elicker said.  
He said New Haven did not “obstruct justice,” but that they also would not take on the federal government’s responsibility for immigration enforcement. 
“Our police department has already too many things to worry about without having to be commandeered by the federal government to implement an unjust and inappropriate policy,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP_Hartford_skyline-1024x629.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)As work has picked up in the Maine House of Representatives and Senate, so has the amount of legislation making its way to the governor’s desk. 
Each week, the clerk of the House of Representatives publishes a report of the bills that Gov. Janet Mills has signed into law and those that she has allowed to become law without the endorsement of her signature. 
Those reports have become more robust as dozens of bills have received passage and enactment votes during each House and Senate session in recent weeks.
Since May 23, Mills has signed 45 pieces of legislation into law, according to the report published Friday. The new statutes protect confidential information for utility customers, advance energy storage, and call for the removal of toxic firefighting foam concentrate from the former Brunswick Naval Air Station.
While most of the new laws won’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the session, 10 included specific language to take effect upon the governor’s signature. 
There were also a handful of bills that became law without Mills’ signature. They include:

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s proposal to implement work requirements for Medicaid expansion could be “an exercise in futility” now that the federal government is also considering it, said state Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff.
The state began drafting its proposal immediately following the end of the state legislative session in March, Althoff said, before debates about work requirements heated up at the congressional level.
Department officials presented their plan at the state Board of Social Services meeting Friday morning via video conference, just before the first of two public hearings on the proposal.
“Respectfully, humbly, we ask for your grace,” Althoff told board members, “because we’re asking for your feedback on something that might be obsoleted by the vote of 100 senators and the stroke of a pen from our president.”
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match — funding that could be in jeopardy, pending the outcome of congressional action. Last year, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state seek approval from the federal government to impose work requirements on expansion enrollees.
Difference between SD and federal proposals
At the federal level, proposed Medicaid work requirements would mandate those between ages 19 and 65 who rely on the program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours each month. The work requirement would be applied at the time of application, and Medicaid renewal would be changed to every six months instead of an annual basis.
Health care advocates form coalition urging Republicans to take their ‘Hands Off Medicaid’

South Dakota’s plan would require adult Medicaid recipients work, train, attend school or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home unless they meet an exception. Compliance with the state-level work rules would be reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application. The state would not require a set number of hours of work or education time.
Heather Petermann, Medicaid director at the department, said the requirement would be a “complement” to Medicaid to “encourage” work without “trying to track arbitrary work hours.” 
“This approach really recognizes that for many individuals who need assistance with health care, that comes first,” Petermann said. “Then it allows them to maintain their health so that they can work, or obtain the health needed to seek employment.”
The federal government also has more exceptions in its proposal than the state, including tribal community members, people who are in foster care or were in foster care who are younger than 26, and people released from incarceration in the last 90 days.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or postpartum.
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration.
Diagnosed with cancer or another serious or terminal medical condition by a physician.
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home.
In an area with unemployment 20% or more above the national average and are exempt from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

As of last month, 30,542 South Dakotans were covered by the Medicaid expansion. The state estimates 80% of them already work or qualify for an exception.
SD seeks Medicaid work rules in spite of similar moves by Congress

The proposed state-level work requirement would reduce enrollment by an estimated 5-10% in the first year. That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department says.
The federal proposal as it stands now will cost more administratively than South Dakota’s proposed work requirements, Althoff added. States “will be asked to absorb” costs if the federal proposal is adopted. The state’s proposal requires less administrative oversight to reduce anticipated costs, due in part to the state’s tight budget approved by the Legislature this year.
“That’s just sort of naming the tension about how not having new funds is sort of an important wrinkle to our development process,” Althoff said. “It’s really having to be done within an existing budget.”
Board member Colleen Winter said the proposal is “respectful” of the individuals the department serves.
Work requirements are already in place for some federal programs, such as SNAP, and state efforts, such as child care assistance and parental reunification expectations within Child Protection Services.
Department hears from one person during public hearing
While more than 20 people sat in on a virtual public hearing regarding the state’s proposed Medicaid work requirements on Friday, only one member of the public spoke.
Attorney Nathaniel Amdur-Clark spoke on behalf of the Great Plains Tribal Leaders Health Board. He said his client wants to see an exception for Indian Health Service beneficiaries.
Native Americans who are tribal enrolled members are eligible to receive health care services through the federal Indian Health Service. Those individuals are eligible for Medicaid coverage even if they do not meet other Medicaid requirements, such as income limits, “to implement and further trust and treaty obligations the U.S. has to provide health care” for tribal members, Amdur-Clark said. 
Though Althoff and Petermann did not respond to Amdur-Clark’s comments about IHS patients, they did address the subject during the earlier board meeting. Petermann said the proposal includes “geographic exemptions,” including areas of the state with “high unemployment.”
“Things like that would also apply to tribal members and American Indians, but we otherwise did not call out or exclude American Indians,” Petermann said. “The approach is that this is a benefit and we want that dignity and pride to be part of the benefit for everybody, so they would be treated the same in this approach.”
Amdur-Clark added that there are technical concerns regarding exemptions in the proposal and that more work is needed to achieve “real tribal consultation.” The department met with some tribal leaders last week to discuss the proposal, Althoff said.

Shelly Ten Napel, CEO of the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas, said in an emailed statement that her organization is monitoring state and federal work requirement proposals closely. The group did not give input at the first public meeting, but plans to share its perspective on state work requirements during the public comment period.
Ten Napel opposed last year’s ballot measure authorizing the state’s pursuit of work requirements. Compared to the work requirement proposal being considered in Congress, Ten Napel said, the state proposal is “overall pretty reasonable.”
Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration “did a careful job of responding to concerns” raised during the debate last year, Ten Napel said, including administrative burdens and exceptions.
“We look forward to working with them to ensure smooth implementation of the new rules if they are approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,” Ten Napel said in the statement. “We also encourage members of Congress to take a careful look at the common sense approach South Dakota is taking and rethink some of the heavy-handed rules currently under consideration in the Big Beautiful Bill.”
The “big beautiful bill” is the budget reconciliation legislation that the U.S. House sent to the Senate last week, including a Medicaid work requirements provision.
Petermann said during the board meeting that South Dakota could perhaps seek to impose its own work requirements, even if the federal legislation passes.
“For example, some of the draft language does include references to things like ‘the provisions from the federal legislation cannot be waived,’ but we don’t know whether that means states still could or couldn’t have something that is less or more restrictive, as long as it has the same components,” Petermann said. “We really don’t know for sure yet.”
If the state moves forward, it will submit an application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in July or August. After that, the proposal would go through a federal comment period and application review.
The department’s next public hearing on the proposed Medicaid work requirements is set for 11 a.m. Central on June 12 at the Sioux Falls office of the Department of Social Services, and online.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)COLFAX – A long-anticipated bridge replacement project over North Fork of the Palouse River is being postponed until 2029 because of the state’s transportation budget shortfall.
“We were ready to go. In fact, the ad date was supposed to be October,” said Ryan Overton, communications manager for Washington State Department of Transportation’s eastern region.
The $13 million project would have replaced two aging bridges on State Route 26 and U.S. Highway 195 with a single structure designed to accommodate wide loads, heavy truck traffic, and a shared-use path at the north end of town. A roundabout was also planned to improve traffic flow at the intersection of the two highways.
“We are trying to understand why it was postponed,” Overton said.
He said WSDOT had been working with the community since December 2022, having town halls with the city council, farmers and the trucking community to ensure they got local feedback on the project.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, one bridge was built in 1931, with an average of 6,470 in daily traffic. The other, built in 1936, has an average of 243 in daily traffic.
Both bridges are rated in “fair condition,” according to the transportation department.
Matt Hammer, public works director for Colfax, said the delay won’t cause immediate issues but could lead to higher costs in the future because of inflation. He also said the city is in the midst of designing a water improvement upgrade; the new bridge was going to support a new water pipe for future development.
“There’s no leaks happening, but the current Highway 26 bridge supports our water pipeline,” Hammer said.
Since they were notified of the delay, he said the city is scaling back its water infrastructure project until WSDOT provides further updates.
“It’s not really hurting us right now, but we put some time and effort and a little bit of money into planning for something that didn’t work out for us,” Hammer said.
Casey Jones, manager and part owner of Jones Truck and Implement, said his business has been involved in discussions with WSDOT about replacing the bridge for about a decade. While he’s not immediately affected by the delay, the main concern is the life expectancy of the two aging bridges.
“We just had the largest tax increase in Washington state’s history that I’m aware of, so resources are limited for building projects, and there are hundreds of bridges that are at the end of life in Washington state,” Jones said. “Nobody knows what the life expectancy for sure is of those bridges, but they’ve served this community very well.”
The only major issue he recalled was a 1996 flood that forced the closure of Highway 195 when water levels reached the bottom of one of the bridges.
“The water was cresting and hitting the bottom of the bridge. So that had been the only case where there had been a possible failure,” Jones said.
Jones raised concerns about how the proposed roundabout would affect large agricultural equipment with the amount of traffic and heavy hauling that runs through the area north of Colfax, including for grain, hay and livestock. He said moving into the new bridge design and having the roundabout has been a “scary proposition,” because farmers and truckers are going from four lanes across that area to 2½.
“It’s a pretty important piece of infrastructure for our whole farming community,” Jones said.
Overton said WSDOT remains committed to the bridge replacement project and will continue working with local community members in the lead-up to 2029.
“We’ve been able to work with WSDOT to come up with a design that will fit our region and fit for future growth of our region and look forward to the improvement,” Jones said.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Ivy Tech Community College will lay off 202 employees statewide as it responds to significant cuts in state funding and frozen tuition rates, the school system’s president, Sue Ellspermann, announced Friday.
The layoffs — affecting both full-time and part-time workers — represent about 2.8% of Ivy Tech’s total workforce, including 180 full-time positions, or 5.3% of its full-time staff, according to data provided by the college. The reductions include 38 faculty members, 162 staff and two administrative faculty.
In a Friday letter to school employees, Ellspermann said the layoffs are a result of a $54 million shortfall over two years, driven by a 5% cut in state appropriations to higher education institutions. An additional 5% in potential funding held in reserve by the State Budget Agency deepened the financial strain.
“Because the college’s primary revenue sources are state appropriations, tuition, and fees, these developments have had an immediate effect on our planning,” Ellspermann wrote in her letter. “We have reached the difficult decision to adjust our staffing levels, in addition to efforts to reduce our operational expenses.”
Story continues below.
Important Budget Update and Staffing Changes
“Staffing reductions are always difficult decisions that we do not make lightly,” Ellspermann continued. “These changes do not reflect the value of their work, but rather the harsh financial reality we currently face.”
Layoffs began Friday and will continue into next week. Affected Ivy Tech workers will receive separation packages, according to Ellspermann’s letter.
The largest number of layoffs occurred at the college’s Systems Office in Indianapolis, which is slated to lose 44 employees. Among the other campus cuts are 21 staff in Indianapolis; 14 each in Bloomington and Columbus; 12 in Kokomo; 11 in Evansville; and another 11 in South Bend/Elkhart.
 


The General Assembly appropriated about $243 million and $245 million for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years, respectively. The latest state budget passed earlier this year will drop that funding to about $236 million in both the 2025-26 and 2026-27 fiscal years.
In a separate letter sent to state lawmakers on Friday, Ellspermann said that student services and academic quality remain priorities, noting that all 19 campuses across Indiana will remain operational. She emphasized that the college has no tenured faculty and “will have the continued ability to adjust the size of our faculty nimbly as enrollment and industry needs fluctuate.”
Ellspermann added that Ivy Tech has previously implemented other cost-saving measures, including rolling technology fees into tuition and eliminating distance education charges, which together cost the college more than $9 million annually in lost revenue.
“This is a challenging moment for our college, but I know Ivy Tech is strong,” Ellspermann said. “I remain confident in our resilience and in our commitment to our students and to one another.”

[…]","The entrance to the Montana Supreme Court (Photo by Eric Seidle/ For the Daily Montanan).In a sprawling, 61-page decision that had about as many opinions attached to it as members of Montana’s highest court, a majority of justices said that the State of Montana, specifically the governor’s office, should pay attorneys fees in a public documents fight between the office and groups wanting more information about a mining executive.
However, the particular details before the court were not whether a former mining executive should be permitted to lead a mining company after his former company was found to be a “bad actor” by state law. Instead, the Montana Supreme Court weighed in on when the government should pay attorneys fees in the public records dispute.
In a fractured mix of majority, concurring and dissenting opinions, at least four justices agreed that Lewis and Clark District Judge Christopher Abbott should have given attorneys fees to the Montana Environmental Information Center and Earthworks, which had sued Gov. Greg Gianforte for documents related to Phillips S. Baker, Jr., and permitting documents related to both Hecla Mining and the Montanore mine. The MEIC argued that the state had not enforced its “bad actor” provision against Baker, the Hecla CEO, because of his leadership in a company that went went bankrupt, while leaving millions of dollars of mining mess to be taken care of in perpetuity by the state.
MEIC and Earthworks, which won the public documents fight against the governor, also asked for attorneys fees because they brought the lawsuit under the Montana Constitution’s right-to-know provisions. In the state, judges have discretion to award attorneys fees when private groups or individuals are successful in vindicating constitutional rights, like obtaining public documents.
Previously, the Montana State Supreme Court had been reluctant to recommend a checklist of conditions that have to be met in order to award attorneys fees, instead relying on the judgment of district or trial court judges. However, a majority of the court decided to take up the issue, saying that more guidance was necessary for judges, something a minority, including Chief Justice Cory Swanson, balked at. The dissenting opinions centered on the idea that judges should still have latitude to decide on a case-by-case basis, and that if the Legislature wanted to mandate attorneys fees, it should be done in law.
Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote the majority opinion, with James Jeremiah Shea, Katherine Bidegaray and Ingrid Gustafson concurring. Justices Jim Rice and Beth Baker, along with Swanson were in the minority.
The majority pointed out in the case that the governor’s office had employed a “novel” legal theory that Abbott debunked, but even so, “the court found the governor’s office shirked its clear legal duty to MEIC’s request.”
“When a party succeeds in litigation based on a right to know request, it has performed a public service in ensuring that Montana’s government is appropriately transparent and accountable to the people,” the majority opinion said.
The justices reasoned that if constitutionally protected rights are meaningful, then litigation — or the ability to take the government to court — must be accessible.
“The result of the district court’s order — that MEIC prevailed and undeniably performed a public service, yet it is denied attorney’s fees — is dissonant with the foundational purposes of Article II, Section 9, and actively disincentivizes citizens from enforcing that right,” the majority opinion said. “For citizens to be able to enforce the provision against the government, litigation must be accessible; for litigation to be accessible, there should be a basic presumption towards awarding attorney’s fees when the party seeking to enforce the right to know has prevailed on its merits.”
The majority shifted the blame back to the Montana Supreme Court, saying the state’s provisions for awarding attorneys fees had created a “vacuum of necessary guidance,” and the majority wanted to more fully develop the advice.
Abbott had determined that because Gianforte had not acted in bad faith, and because attorneys fees would essentially be borne by Montana taxpayers, he decided not to award attorneys fees.
However, the court said the calculus Abbott used — whether there was evidence of bad faith — shouldn’t be the deciding factor in the right-to-know cases.
“When a plaintiff prevails on the merits of a right to know dispute, it means that, whether in good faith or bad faith, the government pushed back against the constitutional presumption and, in doing so, violated a fundamental right,” the opinion said. “But because we have previously neglected to suggest a presumption — or even a preference — for awarding fees in this context, even plaintiffs with an exceptionally strong case and an egregious violation must carefully consider whether it is worth the risk of winning the documents but losing fees.”
The court’s opinion also said it was taking up the matter because it’s essential for courts and citizens to understand fundamental or Constitutional rights.
“We seek to provide basic guidance that works to encourage and strengthen the people’s exercise of a fundamental constitutional right. This presumption does not eliminate judicial discretion, but rather structures it to reflect the constitutional emphasis on transparency,” the ruling said. “This presumption is not a novelty imagined at the whims of this court; it is part of the fabric of the right to know which has been errantly lost to an unboundedly deferential standard that allows for results fundamentally at odds with the Constitution.”
Leaders from both Earthworks and MEIC cheered the decision, saying the decision was a win for residents who want to keep tabs on government officials.
“Montana’s Constitution guarantees the public the right to know what government is up to. Justice only works when every person has the ability to oversee their government,” said Anne Hedges, executive director with MEIC. “This decision will ensure the public can continue to access government documents and will prevent abuse when the government officials refuse to comply with the constitution.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota colleges are being advised to assess their risk and campus policies as the number of measles cases continues to grow in the state. 
Burke County on Thursday became the fourth North Dakota county with a confirmed measles case, the state Department of Health and Human Services reported. 
Grand Forks County reported another measles case Friday, bringing the state total to 29 cases, the most for the potentially fatal disease since 1978. 
The health department, on its measles information website, added two additional exposure locations in Crosby in Divide County, which neighbors Burke County.
The State Board of Higher Education on Thursday discussed the measles outbreak as campuses prepare to host summer youth camps and tours for prospective students. 
“Campuses have expressed concerns about camps that they run in the summer,” Vice Chancellor Lisa Johnson said in an update for the board. She noted that many campuses also are home to a child care facility.  
As states loosen childhood vaccine requirements, health experts’ worries grow

Only four of the 29 people in North Dakota who have contracted measles since May 2 are over age 19, according to the state health agency. Williams County was the first to report a measles case, followed by Cass and Grand Forks. All 29 people were unvaccinated, according to state officials. Two hospitalizations have now been reported, one in Cass and the other in Grand Forks County. 
Johnson encouraged the 11 schools in the North Dakota University System to assess how many unvaccinated people are on campuses and consider being proactive.
“One thing that we can do as campuses … is reach out to your local health providers, health department and doing some sort of vaccine clinic,” Johnson said. 
Johnson encouraged campuses to get a handle on who is and is not vaccinated through voluntary self-reporting. 
If there are students in campus housing and on meal plans who are required to self-isolate because of a measles exposure, colleges will need to have a plan for providing meals and other accommodations. 
She said that exemptions from vaccination requirements have become easier to obtain in recent years. She said she recognized that campuses are probably not eager to mandate vaccinations and then have to deal with exemption requests. 
Board member Casey Ryan of Grand Forks is a retired doctor. He noted the long incubation time of the measles virus, allowing people who don’t realize they are infected to spread the disease. 
“You really have to push the vaccination,” Ryan said. “I understand it’s a personal choice.”
Interim Chancellor Brent Sanford said the good news is that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is effective and readily available and that vaccination rate among adults in most areas of the state is high.

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility, tried to stop an energy engineer who planned to testify about climate change from participating in a rate case as an expert witness.
It also attempted to curtail testimony based on an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report.
The monopoly utility argued some of the testimony was an attempt to introduce “inadmissible hearsay and exhibits,” such as the IPCC report.
The IPCC is an international United Nations body set up to assess science related to climate with 195 members.
The utility also said the energy engineer sought to offer “improper legal opinions as a nonlawyer” and requested the Montana Public Service Commission strike that testimony.
On a 3-2 vote Tuesday, the Montana Public Service Commission supported a staff recommendation to allow the engineer, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, to testify as an expert witness.
But the PSC agreed he could not offer legal conclusions, as also recommended in the draft order from staff.
A minority on the commission tried to block expert testimony from the witness.
The order to allow the engineer to testify as an expert happened when PSC President Brad Molnar urged the commission to avoid a double standard and treat the witness fairly.
The PSC is all Republican, and Molnar said if the commission determined the MEIC witness wasn’t an expert, a future commission with a different political makeup could use the same rationale to disqualify witnesses for NorthWestern Energy.
He also said the commission will have the ability to test the engineer’s testimony.
“If there is one golden nugget in there, either substantiated by cross examination or refuted by cross examination, it has been worthy of our time,” Molnar said.
Molnar also said the argument to silence the engineer was not based in fact.
“What we have is a desire to stop one person from testifying because one other moving party (NorthWestern) in this soon-to-be drama doesn’t want people to hear what he has to say,” Molnar said. “And I can’t go with that.”
The dispute is one small debate in another rate case filed by NorthWestern Energy and already drawing scrutiny after a 2023 settlement the PSC approved that hiked electric bills nearly 28%.
Montanans have been fighting about the effects of climate change in different political arenas, including at the utility regulatory agency.
The witness whom NorthWestern tried to block, Nick Fitzmaurice of the Montana Environmental Information Center, said in written pre-filed testimony the utility has “neglected to account” for risks that climate change poses to its operations and credit.
“Corporate analysts have specifically and repeatedly noted that ‘climate change’ creates multiple risks for NorthWestern Energy,” Fitzmaurice said in part of his testimony. “Moody’s identified climate change as posing multiple risks to NorthWestern Energy.”
Attempts to cull and curate witness testimony in cases aren’t new, but the debate this week shows the pending rate case as another battleground over the role played by climate change in energy costs.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the utility was not attempting to disallow information in the case.
“This motion was made not to limit an issue or topic but to ensure the professional standards for qualification as an expert witness were upheld,” Black said. “NorthWestern did not have any issues with this witness testifying as a lay or fact witness.”
However, Anne Hedges, with the Montana Environmental Information Center, said NorthWestern admits it doesn’t employ any scientific expert on climate change itself.
Hedges said it’s disingenuous for the utility to try to bill customers for climate impacts such as wildfire yet try to stifle the person giving testimony about climate change.
“Not having testimony means the commission can’t consider climate change at all, and that is exactly what they want,” Hedges said of NorthWestern. “So good for Brad Molnar. Good for the commission.”
In its motion, NorthWestern called on the PSC to strike “irrelevant evidence” from Fitzmaurice, energy transition engineer for the MEIC.
Fitzmaurice holds a bachelor’s degree in industrial management systems engineering from Montana State University and has worked in energy policy and modeling, according to his MEIC biography.
The utility tried to exclude his statements about its emissions and the economic impacts of climate change in Montana, and it tried to exclude testimony from Kyle Unruh of Renewable Northwest.
NorthWestern also disputed Fitzmaurice as an expert witness — experts are allowed to rely on reports, or “hearsay” not personally experienced, to explain their opinions.
NorthWestern, though, said Fitzmaurice should only be allowed to testify as a “lay witness” — meaning he could testify only from personal experience, which would exclude testimony based on an IPCC report.
Witnesses in rate cases file written testimony in advance of hearings.
At the meeting this week, PSC legal counsel Lucas Hamilton said staff found some of the testimony Fitzmaurice provided to be “impermissible legal conclusions” more appropriately submitted later on in the case.
However, Hamilton said staff recommended finding Fitzmaurice’s testimony relevant, contrary to NorthWestern’s motion, although he said its credibility would be up to the commission to determine.
Before the PSC approved the recommended order from staff, Commissioner Annie Bukacek moved to disqualify Fitzmaurice, with support from Commissioner Jennifer Fielder.
Bukacek said Fitzmaurice “has not done enough actual work” in his field, and she had yet to meet an “expert in climatology or energy policy” who didn’t have a doctorate degree.
“Standards matter in any field that provides critical information, such as energy policy,” Bukacek said.
In response to a question, however, Hamilton said without a point of reference from the parties, the standard for qualifying a person as “an expert” within the field of energy policy is discretionary.
In the meantime, he said, the Montana rules of evidence call for a liberal interpretation of who is an expert — and allow an expert’s testimony to be scrutinized.
PSC staff attorney Amanda Webster said if the PSC deemed Fitzmaurice a “lay witness” as opposed to an expert, it would “effectively preclude him” from testifying altogether.
“There wouldn’t be much left of his testimony,” Webster said.
The move to oust Fitzmaurice from the list of experts failed, with only Bukacek and Fielder in support. Commissioners Randy Pinocci and Jeff Welborn supported Molnar’s move to adopt the draft order prepared by staff.
Pinocci said he didn’t want a disqualification by the PSC to lead to a costly lawsuit alleging the commission had drawn an improper conclusion about an expert.
Unruh, with Renewable NorthWest, declined to comment beyond his written testimony. The order from the PSC denied NorthWestern’s move to strike his remarks.
Relying in part on an IPCC report, Unruh argues NorthWestern is putting Montana ratepayers at “substantial economic risk” and “regulatory risk” by ignoring the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.
But Hedges, with the MEIC, said NorthWestern Energy has become more bullish, and the rate case is demonstrating “their new aggressive position toward the commission and toward customers.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant2.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

Dan Sullivan gives an annual address to the Alaska State Legislature on Mar 20, 2025 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)After Alaska’s U.S. Rep. Nick Begich cast a vote to advance a budget reconciliation package that would be catastrophic for Alaska, we are counting on our senators to step up. With a narrow balance of power in the U.S. Senate, if U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan has the courage to work with Sen. Lisa  Murkowski, he can help stop this unprecedented attack on health care and core Medicaid services. President Donald Trump and Republicans are trying to cancel Alaskans’ Medicaid health coverage to finance tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy, and those elitists will succeed if our senators don’t fight back.
Alaska has one of, if not the highest rates of suicide, child abuse, domestic abuse, and sexual assault in the nation. Many of the victims utilize services that are funded by Medicaid. This may include individualized therapy and family therapy, intensive behavioral support in community and school settings, case management that secures outside resources for families in need such as food stamps, housing, therapeutic foster care placements, and reunification with families or adoption. Without access to these services, Alaska’s suicide rates could climb, crime rates could increase, and more children could enter foster care without the supportive treatment they need to navigate their trauma. 
As a frontline mental and behavioral health worker, I worry for the youth I serve and how lack of available services and strained capacity will impact their growth. I worry that in the future, I may see youth that I have served living on the streets, turn to drugs to cope, or succumb to suicide. This month, Anchorage lost the Crisis Recovery Center that provided emergency care to teens experiencing mental health crises. Can we really afford to lose anything more? 
Our senators have the chance to ensure the youth of Alaska have a safe and stable future. Based on public statements, U.S. Republican Senators Murkowski, Lisa Collins of Maine, and Josh Hawley of Missouri all oppose cuts to Medicaid. Sullivan could be a deciding vote. Will he vote in lockstep to give Outside billionaires a tax cut financed by stealing Alaskans’ health coverage, or will he stand up for his adopted state?

(Photo courtesy of VisitGreenvilleSC)When President Trump’s top trade adviser attacked BMW in Greer, the local reaction was swift and fierce.
“He’s divorced from reality,” said Spartanburg County Council Vice Chair David Britt, speaking of that top official, Peter Navarro. “He has a twisted view of the United States. He lives in the ‘70s.”
Ouch. But there’s more: “This is why you don’t let people and passengers on a plane fly it,” Britt added.
In other words, Britt was inviting Navarro, architect of Trump’s controversial tariff policies, to kindly butt out of the Upstate’s business.
In ruby red South Carolina, that’s some tough talk directed at Trump’s influential trade adviser.
What prompted the strong reaction from Britt and Upstate business leaders was Navarro blasting BWM and Mercedes for importing car parts to make finished vehicles in South Carolina.
“This business model where BMW and Mercedes come into Spartanburg, South Carolina, and have us assemble German engines and Austrian transmissions — that doesn’t work for America. It’s bad for our economics. It’s bad for our national security,” Navarro said.
Navarro was referring to BMW’s sprawling manufacturing facility known as Plant Spartanburg. But he got the Mercedes plant location wrong. It’s near Charleston, not Spartanburg.
Navarro believes Trump’s tariffs will force auto companies to manufacture all car parts, “from bolt to body,” here in the U.S.
“Peter Navarro is out of touch,” Britt said. “He needs to visit Plant Spartanburg with BMW if he really wants to see what’s going on. My blood boils when this sort of thing happens.”
Tariffs raise costs
The strong reaction by Britt and Upstate business leaders was really not surprising.
The not-so-secret reality of the Upstate economy is that it’s driven by massive foreign investment and strong international imports and exports.
The globalization goose lays the golden eggs. Or call it a Carolina wren.
The Upstate economy is internationally connected. Tariffs raise costs, obstructing the smooth and successful operation of South Carolina’s top manufacturers. Those higher costs are passed on to the American consumer in the form of higher prices.
In the Lowcountry, meanwhile, David Wren reports in the SC Daily Gazette that Volvo Cars has halted production at its Ridgefield plant because of a parts shortage caused at least in part by Trump’s fluctuating tariffs.
Trump, it seems, is a president who likes walls, whether on the southern border or in the form of trade barriers like tariffs.
The average U.S. tariff rate is 17.8%, more than seven times the 2.5% Trump inherited, the Financial Times recently reported.
But the Upstate’s iconic symbol is not a wall but a bridge. Aptly named “Liberty Bridge,” the expansive footbridge towers over the beautiful Reedy River Falls near downtown Greenville.
The modern miracle of Greenville — and if you’ve been around at least three decades or so, you know what a miracle it is — is built on trade freedom, not on trade war.
Washington speaks of economic adversaries. The Upstate seeks out economic partners.
With classic Southern hospitality, the Upstate has welcomed hundreds of international businesses such as Germany’s BMW (more than 11,000 workers), France’s Michelin (more than 9,000 workers), Sweden’s Eloctrolux, Switzerland’s Nestle, Japan’s Fujifilm, and Germany’s ZF, Bosch, Adidas, and Draexlmaier, just to name a few.
The Greenville Area Development Corporation points out that South Carolina as a whole frequently ranks as the No. 1 state for attracting jobs through foreign direct investment per capita.
More than 250 international firms from 28 countries have a major presence in the Upstate.
“We welcome this melting pot of residents and visitors with open arms,” the Greenville development corporation says.
‘Good for America’
In a joint statement, the Greenville Chamber of Commerce and OneSpartanburg rose to the defense of BMW, drawing attention to the Upstate’s diversified and globalized economy: “BMW Group’s Plant Spartanburg drove Upstate South Carolina’s transformation from a declining textile economy to a thriving center of advanced manufacturing.”
BMW packs an economic wallop, employing more than 11,000 workers and providing a $26.7-billion impact for South Carolina.
The plant is the largest exporter of vehicles by value in the U.S., shipping 225,000 vehicles worth more than $10 billion in 2024, Upstate business leaders said.
BMW has produced 5 million vehicles in Greer since the plant opened in 1994.
U.S. Rep. William Timmons, who represents Greenville and Spartanburg counties in Congress, and Gov. Henry McMaster also added their support for BMW’s policies.
“I can assure you that BMW is good for South Carolina and America,” Timmons said.
The SC Daily Gazette’s Jessica Holdman provided a detailed and in-depth report on how Trump’s tariffs could cause serious harm to South Carolina’s thriving auto industry.
Tariffs raise prices on imported car parts and potentially undermine car exports from South Carolina.
Trump has scaled back some of his disruptive auto tariffs, but not permanently.
Globalization doesn’t deserve all the credit for the Upstate’s bustling and ever-growing economy, but international investment and free trade have been an unambiguous godsend for the region and the entire state.
Upstate businesses will weather the storm, knowing that the nation eventually will return to its free-trade foundation.
After all, the Upstate’s defining symbol is a bridge, not a wall.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in federal court in that year, claiming Monroe County Sheriff Richard Ramsay unlawfully detained and nearly deported the U.S. citizen. 
U.S. Judge Kathleen Williams ruled in favor of Brown on summary judgement Friday on two counts: unconstitutional seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment and false imprisonment. 
According to court records, Brown, born in Philadelphia in 1968, turned himself in for a probation violation in 2018 after testing positive for marijuana. His fingerprints were submitted to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which identified him as having a final removal order and he was held by the county to be taken into federal custody. 
While in custody, Brown insisted to sheriff deputies that he was a citizen and offered a birth certificate. County officials did nothing to contest ICE’s claim that Brown was not a citizen, Williams wrote. 
“Mr. Brown repeatedly informed MCSO of his U.S. citizenship prior to the new arrest and offered documentation of his claims. The Court finds that this is the exact type of information that renders the earlier probable cause determination to be stale, requiring some sort of action on MCSO’s part to verify or inquire about ICE’s probable cause determination.”
The 2018 arrest was the second time Brown had been arrested after being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen. ICE had been looking for someone else named Peter Brown, with a different middle name. 
According to court findings, sheriff’s employees routinely accessed a database that identified Brown as a citizen, but did not pass that information on to ICE.

After Brown’s time in jail for the probation violation concluded, he was immediately re-arrested to be held for ICE and potential deportation to Jamaica. He was transported to Krome Detention Center in Miami. Once there, he told ICE agents he was a citizen. The agents checked his birth certificate and arranged for his release. 
Brown had called ICE multiple times from county jail, but was unable to get through.
“MCSO could have contacted ICE to investigate Mr. Brown’s claims of citizenship or, if unwilling to do that, released him based on their own records that dissipated probable cause. To hold otherwise would be to permit law enforcement agencies to use the collective knowledge doctrine as both a sword and a shield,” Williams wrote. 
That’s a principle that law officers can rely on information provided by other police agencies.
Oral arguments for the case were held on May 15, 2024. 
“We have seen the ICE detainer system fail time and again, but the County still chose to put Mr. Brown through this nightmare,” said Cody Wofsy, deputy project director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “At a moment in which we are seeing a raft of unlawful immigration arrests of citizens by federal and local authorities, this decision is a key reminder that the Fourth Amendment safeguards us all.”
In a 26-page partial summary judgement, Williams denied the sheriff’s motion to throw out Brown’s case.
“The Court is not ordering that MCSO cannot comply with ICE detainers and warrants. Instead, the Court’s holding today is simply that, when MCSO possesses information indicating that an individual in MCSO custody is a U.S. Citizen, MCSO cannot abdicate its legal responsibility and turn a blind eye to this information,” Williams wrote. 
“The Court merely holds that, MCSO cannot choose to do nothing as they did here.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)A battle for the open Senate District 4 seat is taking shape, with half a dozen candidates filing declaration papers with the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s office by Friday’s 4 p.m. deadline. The upcoming special election features four Democrats, one Republican and one independent candidate.
The upcoming Aug. 5 special election marks the first time the district spanning North Providence and the northern part of Providence will have a new state senator in over 40 years. Voters will choose the person who will fill the unexpired term of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died April 21, at age 76. Ruggerio was first elected to the Senate in 1984.
Each declared candidate still must secure 100 signatures from certified voters within the district to qualify for the ballot. The signature deadline is June 10.
The four Democratic candidates would first compete in a special primary on July 8. 
Among the Democratic contenders is former state representative Marcia Ranglin-Vassell of Providence. The 64-year-old Providence Public Schools teacher served three terms representing Rhode Island’s House District 6 before deciding not to run again in 2022.
In a May 2 Facebook post announcing her intent to run, Ranglin-Vassell touted a “proven track record of fighting and winning.” During her six years in the House, she championed progressive policies like a $15 minimum wage and gun control alongside education and equity initiatives.
Education reform was a top priority for fellow Democratic candidate Manny Taveras. Taveras, 40 of North Providence, also emphasized housing and small business services in his May 14 campaign announcement.
Manny Taveras is the younger brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, who led the capital city from 2011 to 2015. The younger Taveras also worked for the Providence mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Services from 2008 to 2010, according to his LinkedIn page. He now works as an account executive for private pharmacy benefits manager MedImpact, according to his LinkedIn. This will be his first run for elected office.
Also in the running is Democratic North Providence Town Councilman Stefano Famiglietti. Famiglietti, 33, recently opened his own law practice in Providence focused on employment matters, and has served as a city councilor since 2018. In a May 20 campaign announcement, Famiglietti stressed municipal services and responsible budgeting as priorities if elected to the state Senate seat.
Rounding out the Democratic primary ballot is Lenny Cioe Jr., a nurse at Blackstone Valley Community Health who unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio in the last three Democratic primaries. The 65-year-old North Providence progressive announced he was entering the race Friday afternoon, 30 minutes before the deadline to file paperwork with the Rhode Island Secretary of State.
Cioe in a statement said his campaign will focus on “local issues,” including “price gouging” by utility provider Rhode Island Energy, and protecting Medicaid and other health programs from federal funding cuts.
The lone Republican, Alexander Asermely, also waited until the final day to formally enter the race. He said in a statement he felt it was time to “step up and use my voice,” lamenting economic, educational and infrastructure shortcomings across the state and within the district.
The 39-year-old father and lifelong North Providence resident works as an attorney for Bellotti Law Group in Boston, according to his LinkedIn page. Asermely is also a political newcomer, having never run for office before.
Asermely does not have any primary opponents, putting him on the path to the August special election as long as he submits the requisite voter signatures.
Also bound for the general election ballot: independent candidate Stephen G. Tocco. The North Providence resident and retired chief of Rhode Island Capitol Police served on the Smithfield Town Council from 2004 to 2007. He also ran multiple unsuccessful campaigns for state Senate, including against Ruggerio in a three-way Democratic primary in 2022. All but one of his prior candidacies for office have been as a Democrat; in 2020, he ran as an independent candidate for the Senate District 22 seat, which spans parts of Smithfield, North Providence and Lincoln.
While the seat was held by a Democrat for the last 40 years, the district is nearly evenly split between registered Democrats and independents, who comprise 45% and 44%, respectively, of its 22,300 registered voters as of May, according to data with the Rhode Island Department of State. The remaining 11% of voters are registered Republicans.
Voters have until June 8 to register, or disaffiliate, ahead of the July 8 primary election. Early voting is set to begin June 18, running through July 7.
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)For the seventh time, Gov. Tony Evers ordered the Progress Pride Flag to fly over the Wisconsin State Capitol for LGBTQ Pride Month. 
This year, Pride Month begins on the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which gave same-sex couples the right to get married in 2015. But Evers’ celebration of LGBTQ pride is occuring as the administration of President Donald Trump attacks the rights of transgender people and a recent Gallup poll found that Republican acceptance of same-sex marriage has fallen to its lowest level in nine years. 
“When the Pride Flag flies above the People’s House, it sends a clear and unequivocal message that Wisconsin recognizes and celebrates LGBTQ Wisconsinites and Americans,” Evers said in a statement. “Every day, but especially today and this month, we reaffirm our commitment to striving to be a place where every LGBTQ kid, person, and family can be bold in their truth and be safe, treated with dignity and respect, and welcomed without fear of persecution, judgment, or discrimination. I promised long ago that, as governor, I would always fight to protect LGBTQ Wisconsinites with every tool and every power that I have. I will never stop keeping that promise.”
In the executive order Evers signed Friday, he notes that the LGBTQ has been under attack in recent years, including in Wisconsin where Republicans have tried more than once to pass legislation attacking transgender children.
“Despite historic victories, in the last several years, there has been a significant increase in anti-LGBTQ legislation introduced in state Legislatures across the country, including in Wisconsin, that have targeted LGBTQ kids and people and increased dangerous anti-LGBTQ rhetoric, as well as efforts on a state and national level to erase LGBTQ history and stories.” 
The Progress Pride Flag flying above the Capitol includes the recognizable LGBTQ rainbow colors and a chevron of additional stripes that represent LGBTQ people of color, the transgender community and people with HIV/AIDS.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Job Corps centers in Albany and Brunswick are set to shut their doors by June 30 after the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans to suspend operations at nearly 100 locations nationwide.
The Job Corps program dates back to 1964 and was created as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty.” The program, which claims to be “the largest nationwide residential career training program in the country,” works by providing low-income students ages 16 to 24 with housing, education, career training and employment assistance, primarily in industries like manufacturing, construction and health care. 
However, the program encountered serious hurdles during the COVID-19 pandemic, and currently faces a $140 million budget deficit that Department of Labor officials estimate could grow to $213 million by next year. The federal agency cited a report from April highlighting metrics like the average annual cost per student, average total costs per graduate and total violent crime rates.
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.”
In total, 99 centers that are run by contract agencies will be forced to close should the plan take effect. An additional 24 centers owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture will not be affected by the closures. Atlanta is home to the program’s Region 3 office, overseeing centers across Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
The Department of Labor said it plans to arrange transportation back home for roughly 25,000 currently enrolled students, and to connect them with other educational and employment resources. It is unclear how many students across Georgia will be affected. Calls to the Atlanta-based Jobs Corps office were not answered and emails sent to two top officials received a bounce back message.
Lawmakers in Congress were quick to push back against the sudden closures, citing a long history of bipartisan support for the program.
“The Job Corps program is the embodiment of a hand up and not a handout,” said U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, an Albany Democrat who co-chairs the bipartisan Congressional Job Corps Caucus. “It provides workforce skills and training that empower participants to become self-sufficient and productive citizens. Today’s foolish action by the White House and the United States Department of Labor to close the Job Corps program will shatter the dreams and aspirations of tens of thousands of promising students.”
Critics of the closures, including the National Job Corps Association, have also argued that the data used to compile the report is misleading, since it focuses solely on metrics from 2023, a year when the program was still struggling to recover from pandemic-era hurdles that lowered enrollment and graduation numbers.
Notably, this is not the first time President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted the Job Corps program for closures. Sonny Purdue, the former Georgia governor who later served as Agriculture Secretary in the first Trump Administration and is now the chancellor of the Georgia Board of Regents, also attempted to shutter nine Job Corps centers and transfer an additional 16 centers to private contractors back in 2019. However, he quickly dropped the bid after encountering fierce congressional pushback — including from then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Sabrina Cervantes maintained from the start that she wasn’t drunk or on drugs after she was cited for DUI.,"In summary
California Sen. Sabrina Cervantes maintained from the start that she wasn’t drunk or on drugs after she was cited for DUI. 


Prosecutors will not file DUI charges against California Sen. Sabrina Cervantes, after a blood test showed she had “no measurable amount of drugs or alcohol in her system” following a crash last week in Sacramento a few blocks from the Capitol.
“We have reviewed all the submitted evidence, including police reports, witness statements, and laboratory results. Based on our ethical duty and the burden of proof in a criminal trial, the Sacramento County DA’s Office declines to file any charges in this case,” Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the Sacramento District Attorney’s Office, said in an email.
The announcement is a vindication for Cervantes, a 37-year-old Democrat from the Riverside area. She maintained from the start that she wasn’t impaired and that Sacramento police officers “accosted” her at a hospital where they detained her for several hours. 
Cervantes did not immediately respond to a request for comment today.
The Sacramento Police Department responded with an emailed statement in response to a CalMatters interview request.  
“During their interaction with Sen. Cervantes, they observed objective signs that led them to believe she may have been impaired while operating a motor vehicle,” police said. “The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions.”Officers said Cervantes initially declined to participate with officers’ sobriety tests. So they asked a judge for a warrant for Cervantes to submit to a blood test and told Cervantes they had requested one.
“While the warrant was being written and processed, the senator agreed to voluntarily provide a blood sample, however, since the warrant process was already underway officers waited until it was signed by a judge before proceeding with the blood draw, which was conducted by a licensed phlebotomist,” police said. 
The May 19 crash happened around 1 p.m., less than an hour before she was supposed to be on the floor of the state Legislature.
Last week, CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Cervantes wasn’t at fault in the crash.
The footage shows a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection of 14th and S streets in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way as she drove east on S Street.
Sacramento police said the other driver was cited for failing to stop at a stop sign. Last week, CalMatters filed a public records request seeking body camera footage and police reports.
In the statement, police said they will release some documents later Friday and are still processing others.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/042423-Assembly-Floor-0424-MG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 17:05:40.985741

DemasA federal judge on Thursday said the director of the Michigan Department of Corrections and other defendants did not meet their burden of proof when they alleged that the plaintiffs in an ongoing dangerous conditions lawsuit did not exhaust their administrative remedies before going to court.
It was yet another win for the plaintiffs in Bailey v. Washington, which has been gestating in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan since 2019.
In an order released Thursday by U.S. District Judge Stephen Murphy of the Eastern District of Michigan, the court found significant flaws with the department’s grievance process. MDOC Director Heidi Washington and other department defendants said that the plaintiffs failed to use that process to its fullest extent before filing a lawsuit, but Murphy noted that the flaws in the system prevented the plaintiffs’ grievances from being heard by the department.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“By detailing the consequences of the inadequate ventilation in their grievances, the plaintiffs gave MDOC ‘a fair opportunity to address [the] claims on the merits before federal litigation was commenced,’” Murphy wrote.
Washington and the department defendants moved twice for summary judgment in the case but were denied. After the defendants moved for an evidentiary hearing to resolve factual issues, the matter was moved to a magistrate, who found Washington and department officials failed to meet their burden of proof in showing that plaintiff Paula Bailey and others did not do everything they could to raise concerns over the prison’s declining conditions.
Washington and the defendants challenged the magistrate’s findings, specifically objecting to the assertion that the grievances related to ventilation in the prison had sufficiently put the department on notice. 
Murphy on Thursday said at least two relevant grievances shared in the evidentiary hearing had effectively put the department on notice. 
Murphy also noted that the department had repeatedly rejected grievances as untimely despite circumstances beyond the control of inmates.
bailey-order-overruling-226-objections-and-ado
Washington and the defendants had challenged that portion as going outside the scope of the court’s referral on the factual matters in question, but Murphy said the mail system used by Corrections and its inherent delays were a large part of why the grievances were deemed untimely.
“Faced with this and other issues, the Report found that the grievance policy was unavailable to the plaintiffs Bailey, Clark, and Zentz,” Murphy wrote. “In doing so, the report commented on the prison mailbox rule. The report’s findings, and the way in which [U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Stafford] explained her findings, may have an impact on future cases. But the court will not hold off on adopting the two pages just because they may have consequences in other cases. The objection is overruled.”
The lawsuit alleges that the department maintained poor conditions at the Huron Valley Women’s Correctional Facility, which later led to the presence of toxic mold. The case was initially dismissed along with Pearson v. Corrections, but was later revived by the courts on an amended complaint.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-30 16:07:04.220283

“Luther’s reputation as a selective liberal arts college that is known for its involved students, committed faculty and staff, and a strong sense of community inspired me to apply, and I am delighted to accept President Chamberlain’s offer,” Bacon said in the release. “Given my experience at a faith-based residential liberal arts college and my own life-changing experiences attending a residential liberal arts college, I am excited to engage with the challenges and opportunities that are ahead for Luther College.”
Bacon previously served as faculty and administrator for the College of Saint Benedict, a women’s college, and Saint John’s University, a men’s college, as the institutions share curriculum, faculty and leadership. There she worked to oversee academic affairs and the colleges’ division of student success, according to the release, among other duties.
Once at Luther College, Bacon will oversee a combined department of academic affairs and student success and engagement, the release stated. The college brought academic and student affairs together into one program in 2021, Chamberlain said in the release, and its more holistic methods of serving students have seen success. Bacon said in the release she’s ready to work with the Luther community to “ensure that students receive a holistic, immersive experience that is both academically enriching and personally transformative.”
Chamberlain said he is excited to work with Bacon and see her “impact on improving the experiences of students, faculty and staff” at the college.
“Dr. Bacon brings to Luther College a passion for supporting the holistic development that students should experience, inside and outside of the classroom, at residential, liberal arts colleges,” Chamberlain said. “Informed by her academic training as a social psychologist and her progressive experience as an academic administrator, Dr. Bacon’s empathetic, relational and collaborative approach emphasizes engaging stakeholders, considering alternative perspectives, and using data to inform decision-making processes.”

A campaign website and social media account for Sen. David Yates, the Democratic Whip from Louisville, were updated Friday to reflect his plans to run for Jefferson County clerk next year. His website now has a campaign kick-off scheduled for Monday, June 9, with appearances by Louisville area Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey and former U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth. 
Yates’ updated website comes on the heels of another Democratic senator leaving the caucus. Sen. Robin Webb, of Grayson, changed her party affiliation Friday to join the Republican Party. 
Bobbie Holsclaw, the Jefferson County clerk since 1998, is an elected Republican in Louisville, a Kentucky city where voters tend to favor Democrats. She faced some criticism after the November election following an issue with e-poll books that delayed lines early in the day. Democrats sued to keep the polls open longer in the day, but a Jefferson Circuit judge denied their emergency request. 
Yates’ campaign did not immediately return an emailed request for comment. 
An attorney, Yates was elected to the Senate in 2020. He won reelection in November for the 37th Senate District, taking more than 60% of the vote in the general election.

Unlike criminal bonds, bond seekers only have to post 10% of the bond cost, which many families can’t afford.","Activists protest the agenda of President  Donald Trump during a rally near the water tower on the Magnificent Mile on Jan. 25, 2025, in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)In his six years helping run the Casa San José Bail Fund, Guillermo Perez says lately, he has been attending more ICE bail hearings and helping getting more undocumented immigrants out of detention than ever. 
“People are scared right now, immigrants are being attacked like never before,” said Perez, an immigration activist and retired Steelworkers union organizer. 
In late April, ICE raided a popular Mexican restaurant in Beaver County, 1942 Tequilas and Tacos. Eight employees were detained, one of several that activists say have been happening in Pittsburgh at laundromats, apartment buildings, and even school bus stops. The latest raids in the region were in Braddock and Wilkinsburg in the final days of May. 
For activists like Perez, each raid put them into a scramble to figure out how they could assist immigrants and their families affected. One way is through the Casa San José Bail Fund, which he helped found.
The fund is helping to ease fears by getting immigrants out of detention and giving them legal resources to fight deportations. Founded during the first Trump Administration in 2019, the Casa San José Bail Fund has raised more than $200,000 from people in the Pittsburgh area. Unlike criminal bonds, bond seekers only have to post 10% of the bond cost, which many families can’t afford. 
Since its inception, it’s made 61 loans to various families and helped protect dozens of families from deportation. 
Across Pennsylvania, two other ICE bail funds have emerged to help immigrants in detention.
In Lancaster, where 42% of the population is Latino according to the U.S. Census Bureau the Parish Resource Center maintains the Immigration Bond and Advocacy Network. In Philadelphia, the New Sanctuary Movement maintains the Community Fund for Bond and Legal Support.
Unlike the Casa San José ICE bail fund, which raises all of its money locally, both funds are part of the National Bail Fund Network. The network also helps in providing bail funds for American citizens jailed on criminal charges. 
“They connect different bond funds,” says Peter Pedemonti of the New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia. “So if we might not have all the money, we could connect with a fund in Massachusetts or somewhere else to pull money together.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pedemonti says that there is a growing nationwide movement aimed at getting more immigrants out of ICE detention. 
“At a time where there’s been a daily assault on immigrant families, both on the ground with ICE agents and also from the White House with policy coming out. I think it is, it is really important to have that, like that concrete small action and that concrete action of liberation,,” says Pedemonti. “It’s a small victory for one family.”
Studies have shown that immigrants who can get out of immigration detention are far less likely to be deported. Some fleeing violence can seek asylum and other venues to achieve legal status successfully. The process can often take years, but some immigrants have found legal ways to stay in the United States. 
However, those who stay in detention are sometimes subject to isolation and conditions, which advocates have often described as inhuman and unsanitary. 
“What they do is they put tremendous pressure on people to just go ahead and sign away their rights to due process,” said Perez. “They just use incarceration as a way of pressuring people to self-deport”.

The fund works with a network of immigration attorneys to review the circumstances of each case and assess the likelihood that a bond could be successful. 
“If we assess that they do have a possible path for why they should be allowed to legally stay in the United States, then we go ahead and try to get them legal representation so that they can see if they’re eligible to get a bond,” said Perez. 
Unlike traditional bail funds, Casa San José does not charge interest and allows families to repay the bail over the years. The funds are then reused to help other immigrants get bail. 
Perez says it has helped mobilize immigrants around Pittsburgh to become politically active in groups like Casa San José. 
“Rather than just handing somebody money and wishing them best of luck, we want them to continue to be involved (with) Casa San José, to be involved in helping other people in the community who are being impacted by deportations as well,” said Perez. “So the goal of the bond fund is not only obviously (to) get people out of detention, but also to try to convey that the community is stronger when we support each other”. 
Some donors  sign up to give the fund $20 a month, but the bulk of the money comes from several large fundraisers.  A variety of community groups in Pittsburgh are holding these types of events to support its efforts. 
In late March, Temple Sinai was packed with over 100 Jewish activists who showed up for the “De-ICE Ball.” 
“There’s nothing like when the Jewish community shows up. You guys are no joke,” said Monica Ruiz, the director of Casa San José, to a clapping crowd of Jewish activists.
The event raised more than $18,000.
“I’m shocked at how many people showed up,” said Harry Hochheiser, one of the organizers.
Hochheiser is a member of the Dor Hadash Synagogue. In 2018, one of their congregation’s members, Dr. Jerry Rabonwitz, was killed when a shooter killed 11 Jews who attended three different congregations located in the Tree of Life Synagogue complex, just a few blocks from Temple Sinai. The Oct. 27, 2018, attack is the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. 
The shooter said that he murdered them because their congregations were fundraising to help immigrants through the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society.
“I think to some extent, that’s faded from people’s memories a little bit, even here, but it’s definitely in the back of my mind,” Hochheiser said. 
Hochheiser said Jews, though, are largely motivated to help immigrants due to their own history of persecution. 
He pointed out the fundraiser was taking place right around the 86th anniversary of the United States turning away the SS St. Louis, which was carrying over 900 Jewish refugees fleeing Hitler. They were denied entry to the United States and 254 of the passengers would later be killed in the Holocaust when they were returned to Europe. 
“It’s knowing your history, and it’s looking back to think, ‘Hey, you know what, what was it like for my grandparents,'” he said. “I can’t imagine being turned back or turned away.” 
At a time when many activists say that they feel helpless in stopping the Trump administration’s deportation efforts, organizers say giving to the Casa San José Bail fund gives them a tangible way to help people. 
“I think particularly at this moment, there are a lot of people who are just looking to do something,” said Hochheiser.

(Photo by John McAnulty/Getty Images)The Mount St. Helens visitor center is reopening its doors with the first major renovations since it opened in 1986.
Starting on May 31, the center will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Prior to the renovation, exhibits remained largely unchanged since they were first installed nearly four decades ago, and only six years after the volcano erupted. The center closed Sept. 30, 2024, and work began on upgrades with funding from the state.
The $1.1 million renovation will be centered around the Cowlitz Indian Tribe and the 1980 eruption and will feature more tactile, sensory, interactive exhibits tailored to kids and families.
Mount St. Helens is famous for its massive eruption on May 18, 1980, which killed 57 people, blasted away part of the mountain, and spewed about 540 million tons of ash.
The mountain has played a central role in the customs and culture of the Cowlitz Tribe and other Indigenous people across this region. Washington State Parks worked closely with the tribe to highlight its culture and traditions and provide visitors a holistic understanding of the mountain and the tribe’s perspective.
New exhibits include contemporary and historic works by Cowlitz artists and in the Cowlitz language. One of the exhibits includes a new film of a Cowlitz spiritual leader, Tanna Engdahl. Additionally, there are several short films that highlight the tribe’s use of natural resources.
Since the eruption, the mountain’s landscape has undergone significant changes. Scientists have since deepened their understanding of both the eruption and ongoing volcanic activity within the mountain, said Sarah Fronk, a spokesperson for Washington State Parks.
“The exhibits have been updated to reflect current science and to provide a broader story about the mountain’s long history of eruptions,” she added.
Visitors can expect an enhanced experience with hands-on learning through interactive displays and storytelling, along with improvements to the reception desk design and the flow of the building. Accessibility improvements have also been made inside and outside the building.
Some of the new offerings include a “Make-a-Quake” exhibit that lets you create your own shockwaves with a seismograph, a new and improved “walk-in” volcano that takes you inside a replica of the mountain, and a “Volcano Blasters” pinball machine.
There are also over 80 historic artifacts, volcanic rocks, a wetland exploration area, and a three-dimensional relief map of the mountain.
A new “Junior Volcano Explorer” activity booklet and badge program is also offered to kids.

In a 2-1 decision earlier this month, the panel overruled a North Dakota federal district court’s decision that a redistricting plan adopted by the state in 2021 diluted the voting power of Native voters.
“Turtle Mountain fought hard for a fair and legal map. When the state draws unlawful districts, Courts must step in to protect voters — not pave the way for injustice,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairman Jamie Azure said in a statement published by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs in the suit. “We will continue to fight for fair representation.”
Appeals court rules against North Dakota tribes in voting rights case

The panel’s decision didn’t speak to whether the map itself was discriminatory; instead, the judges found that private individuals cannot use a key federal civil rights law as a vehicle to file cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws race-based voting discrimination.
The panel in its ruling sent the case back to North Dakota U.S. District Judge Peter Welte with instructions to dismiss the lawsuit. If its ruling stands, North Dakota would revert back to the 2021 map.
But if the plaintiffs’ request for an en banc rehearing is granted, the case would go before all 11 judges on the 8th Circuit for review.
“Section 2 is the foundational statute that Congress enacted to fight the scourge of racial discrimination in voting, but citizens in this circuit can no longer enforce the right it provides them,” the plaintiffs argue in a brief urging the full appellate court to consider the case.
Private individuals and groups previously could file discrimination lawsuits against governments under just Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act without having to invoke Section 1983, a separate civil rights statute.
Then, the 8th Circuit in a controversial 2023 ruling on an Arkansas voting rights case found that Section 2 alone doesn’t give private parties the right to sue. Instead, the circuit declared that it is the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney General to file Section 2 discrimination cases.
Tribes, state argue redistricting case to federal appeals court

For more than a year, the question remained open as to whether Section 1983 offered a viable alternative for bringing such Voting Rights Act claims. In a May 14 ruling, the three-judge panel decided it does not.
In a majority opinion, the panel wrote that the language of the Voting Rights Act indicates that Congress didn’t intend for citizens to file race discrimination claims through Section 1983.
The lone dissenting judge on the panel — Chief Judge Steven Colloton — noted in his opinion  that private plaintiffs have brought more than 400 actions under Section 2 since 1982.
The plaintiffs in their brief point out that the 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit in the country to rule that Section 2 cannot be enforced through lawsuits brought by private citizens. The circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.
“Outside of this circuit, every American citizen can rely on an unbroken line of Supreme Court and circuit precedent to enforce the individual rights given to them by Congress in the Voting Rights Act,” their filing states. “But as a result of the panel decision here, and the prior decision in Arkansas, American citizens in this circuit are denied that right.”
The lawsuit was triggered by a redistricting plan adopted by the North Dakota Legislature in 2021 that placed the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations in new districts.

U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 ruled that the new map was discriminatory and ordered the Legislature to implement a new map that placed the reservations in the same voting district.
Three Native American lawmakers from that district were elected in 2024: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit.
“The fair map we secured led to a historic first — a Spirit Lake Nation member elected to the North Dakota Legislature,” Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street said in a Wednesday statement published by the Campaign Legal Center, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs in the case. “This decision threatens that progress and weakens our voice in state government.”
Marcellais had previously served 15 years in the statehouse until he lost his bid for reelection in 2022. He was reelected in 2024. 
Davis was first elected in 2022, then reelected last year.
If the 2021 map is reinstated, three state lawmakers would move to different districts, according to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. Rep. Colette Brown, D-Warwick, would go from representing District 9 to District 15. Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, would switch from District 15 to District 9B, while Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, would switch from District 15 to District 9. They would all have to seek reelection in 2026.

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)Despite years of patient complaints and quality-of-care concerns, Ballad Health — the nation’s largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly — will now be held to a lower standard by the Tennessee government, and state data that holds the monopoly accountable will be kept from the public for two years.
Ballad is the only option for hospital care for most of the approximately 1.1 million people in a 29-county swath of Appalachia. Such a monopoly would normally be prohibited by federal law. But under deals negotiated with Tennessee and Virginia years ago, the monopoly is permitted if both states affirm each year that it is an overall benefit to the public.
However, according to a newly renegotiated agreement between Ballad and Tennessee, the monopoly can now be considered a “clear and convincing” benefit to the public with performance that would earn a “D” on most A-to-F grading scales.
And the monopoly can be allowed to continue even with a score that most would consider an “F.”
Six years into an Appalachia hospital monopoly, patients are fearful and furious

“It’s an extreme disservice to the people of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia,” said Dani Cook, who has organized protests against Ballad’s monopoly for years. “We shouldn’t have lowered the bar. We should be raising the bar.”
The Ballad monopoly, which encompasses 20 hospitals and straddles the border of Tennessee and Virginia, was created in 2018 after lawmakers in both states, in an effort to prevent hospital closures, waived federal antitrust laws so two rival health systems could merge. Although Ballad has largely succeeded at keeping its hospitals open, staffing shortages and patient complaints have left some residents wary, afraid, or unwilling to seek care at Ballad hospitals, according to an investigation by KFF Health News published last year.
In Tennessee, the Ballad monopoly is regulated through a 10-year Certificate of Public Advantage agreement, or COPA — now in its seventh year — that establishes the state’s goals and a scoring rubric for hospital performance. Tennessee Department of Health documents show Ballad has fallen short of about three-fourths of the state’s quality-of-care goals over the past four fiscal years. But the monopoly has been allowed to continue, at least in part, because the scoring rubric doesn’t prioritize quality of care, according to the documents.
Angie Odom, a county commissioner in Tennessee’s Carter County, where leaders have clashed with Ballad, said she has driven her 12-year-old daughter more than 100 miles to Knoxville to avoid surgery at a Ballad hospital.
After years of disappointment in Tennessee’s oversight of the monopoly, Odom said she was “not surprised” by Ballad’s new grading scale.
“They’ve made a way that they can fail and still pass,” she said.
Virginia regulates Ballad with a different agreement and scoring method, and its reviews generally track about one or two years behind Tennessee’s. Both states have found Ballad to be an overall benefit in every year they’ve released a decision.
Neither Ballad Health nor the Tennessee Department of Health, which has the most direct oversight of the monopoly, answered questions submitted in writing about the renegotiated agreement. In an emailed statement, Molly Luton, a Ballad spokesperson, said the company’s quality of care has steadily improved in recent years, and she raised repeated complaints from the hospital system about KFF Health News’ reporting. The news organization has reviewed every complaint from Ballad and has never found a correction or clarification to be warranted in the coverage.

Tennessee Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado, who has more than once described the regulation of Ballad Health as a matter of national importance, has declined or not responded to more than a dozen interview requests from KFF Health News to discuss the monopoly.
“Our effort and progress serve as a model for health care in Tennessee, the Appalachia Region, and the entire nation,” Alvarado said in a May news release about the monopoly, adding, “We do not take our role lightly as we remain committed to transparency in our COPA oversight.”
Tennessee’s revised agreement was negotiated behind closed doors for more than a year and announced to the public in early May. As part of that announcement, Tennessee said it wouldn’t score Ballad next year, to give the company time to adjust to the new scoring process.
Under that process, the minimum score Ballad needs to meet to show a “clear and convincing” public benefit has been lowered from 85 out of 100 to 70 out of 100. The new agreement also awards Ballad up to 20 points for providing Tennessee with data and records — for example, a report on patient satisfaction — regardless of the level of performance documented. The state can also raise or lower Ballad’s overall score by up to 5 points in light of “reputable information” that is not spelled out in the scoring rubric.
Therefore, Ballad can score as low as 65 out of 100, with nearly a third of that score awarded for merely giving information to the state, and still be found to be a “clear and convincing” benefit to the public, which is the highest finding Tennessee can bestow, according to the agreement. And Ballad could score as low as 55 out of 100 without the monopoly facing a risk of being broken up, according to the new agreement.
The agreement also increases how much of Ballad’s annual score is directly attributed to the quality of care provided in its hospitals, from 5% to 32%. But the agreement obscures how this will be measured.
Tennessee sets “baseline” goals for Ballad across dozens of quality-of-care issues — like infection rates and speed of emergency room care — and then tracks whether Ballad meets the goals. The new agreement resets these baselines to values that were not made public, leaving it unclear how much the goals for Ballad have changed. Health department spokesperson Dean Flener said the new baselines would not be disclosed until 2027.
Cook, the longtime leader of protests against Ballad, said she believes Tennessee is attempting to silence data-supported criticism until the final year of the 10-year COPA agreement, which ends in 2028.
By then, any outrage would be largely moot, she said.
“If you are going to wait until the last year to tell us the new measurements, why bother?” Cook said. “It is clear, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Tennessee Department of Health is putting the needs and concerns of a corporation above the health and well-being of people.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – With a little over a month until the July 1 deadline, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance she has concerns about whether the Legislature would be able to pass the state’s budget for Fiscal Year 2026 before the end of June.
“We’re at the stage where we need to negotiate the differences between a House budget and a Senate budget, and the House has not passed what you can reasonably or meaningfully call a budget that we can even negotiate from. So they’re pretty far behind in the process. And so that gives me pause about that deadline,” Brinks said. 
Michigan House Republicans took control of the chamber in the 2024 election, winning a 58-52 majority and bringing an end to Democrats’ trifecta control of the House, Senate and governor’s seat. As a result, the Legislature has deadlocked, passing only four bills since the start of the year. 
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has repeatedly refused to commit to meeting the July 1 deadline, when lawmakers are legally required to pass a budget. However, the state’s fiscal year does not start until Oct. 1, with Hall telling reporters in January that the budget may not be done until Sept. 30. A failure to have a budget in place by the Oct. 1 deadline would force a state government shutdown.
As Democrats raise alarms about the potential for a shutdown, House Republicans have passed what they call a “shutdown prevention plan” which allocates $20 billion for critical programs like schools and local law enforcement if the Legislature cannot reach an agreement by the end of September.

While there is no penalty if lawmakers fail to agree on a new budget by July 1, Brinks noted in an interview with the Advance during the Mackinac Policy Conference that completing the budget on time is critical for municipalities, K-12 schools and universities. 
“They’re all making their plans right now for how they expend resources and serve their folks that they serve. I don’t want to show up at my kid’s school and find out that they didn’t know enough about the resources they have coming from the state to be able to hire enough teachers to teach the kids and have larger class sizes. That’s a completely unnecessary thing, and it’s completely avoidable,” Brinks said. 
And while Hall has slammed the Democratic-led Senate for failing to act on bipartisan road funding legislation and policies establishing a public safety and violence prevention fund to support local law enforcement and community violence intervention organizations, Brinks said those conversations need to be held in the context of the state’s budget. 
“You know something like the public safety trust fund, while there’s a policy element to it, it’s essentially a budget conversation. So get back in the room and have a budget conversation. I know our appropriations chairs have had some conversation, but there’s so much more to the process…. This is exactly the kind of thing that could be worked out in a budget process, and there will, by necessity, need to be compromise,” Brinks said. 
Similarly, allocating $3 billion towards road funding should also be subject to bipartisan discussion, Brinks said. 
“So far, there hasn’t been a lot of willingness to actually have those conversations between us from Matt Hall, and so, you know, at that point, they’re simply just ideas that have been thrown out in the ether. The real work comes in the conversation, in the negotiation, in the sitting down and hashing things out,” Brinks said.
“It’s not glamorous, right? You don’t get to start in your own press conference for two hours as a negotiation. That’s not negotiating. If he wants to do that, that’s fine. But in addition to that, he’s going to have to really find some time or empower his caucus, and there are some capable people there to sit down and really, do that work,” Brinks said. 
While the House and Senate were able to break through their deadlock earlier this month to extend the filing deadline for lawmakers’ legally-required financial disclosures amid frustrations with the rollout of the state’s new financial reporting  system, Brinks said there are several other policies they could be working on if Hall was interested. 
“We could be talking about prescription drug affordability. We could be talking about ways to ensure, you know, we have more affordable housing, we could, you know, be talking about FOIA, you know, something that passed with a really strong bipartisan vote,” Brinks said. 
In January, members of the Senate voted 33-2 to advance Senate Bills 1 and 2 to the House. The package looks to extend FOIA to include the Legislature, the governor and the lieutenant governor, which are exempt under the current state law. However, Hall has declared the package dead, calling them “a very low priority.”
While Hall has pointed to the public safety trust fund as a bipartisan slam dunk, Brinks said the same about FOIA reform.
“It could be an easy bipartisan win that really helps improve transparency and the ethical environment in our state,” she said.

The attorneys for former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and former Republican leader Matt Borges are feeling “hopeful” after a Cincinnati politician convicted of bribery got a pardon from President Donald Trump.
Once convicted of accepting $20,000 in bribes, former Cincinnati City Councilmember PG Sittenfeld’s slate has been wiped clean.
President Donald Trump pardoned the Democrat, who was sentenced to more than a year in prison in 2023.
And with this pardon comes interest from other influential Ohio politicos.
We asked Householder’s attorney Scott Pullins if that gives him hope for Householder.
“Yeah, I can’t comment, obviously, on what we’re doing right now, what I’m working on, our legal team’s working on,” Pullins replied. “But it certainly gives us a lot of hope.”
Thursday, Borges’s appeals attorney, Dennis Belli, said in a phone interview that the Sittenfeld pardon also gives him hope.
In March 2023, a jury found Householder and Borges guilty of felony racketeering in the largest public corruption and bribery scandal in state history.
And earlier this month, a panel of federal court judges upheld the convictions of Householder and Borges.
Clemency
We asked Gov. Mike DeWine if he believes Householder and Borges should be pardoned.
“Look, I don’t have any comment about the pardons,” he responded. “These are decisions that are made by the president of the United States. I have authority in regard to state pardons, and I always will tell you about why I made a decision.”
Pullins has been telling us for months now that the former speaker is seeking clemency, arguing the FBI was politically motivated in arresting the former speaker.
“They singled out Larry, him alone,” he said. “No one else has been charged, no other politician — period.”
Legal expert Steve Gooden, partner at Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, said this could be a sympathetic argument for a pardon.
“It obviously strikes very close to home for Donald Trump who has been the subject of these kinds of inquiries and cases in the past,” Gooden said.
In an interview in February, Attorney General Dave Yost refuted this allegation.
“He was indicted by President Trump’s United States Attorney, David DeVillers, who, I believe, is the same political party,” Yost said. “I don’t think that dog hunts.”
And Yost said he was against Householder getting out. Householder is also facing Ohio charges. He has pleaded not guilty to 10 felony counts in Cuyahoga County.
“I oppose,” Yost said in February. Asked why, he said, “Because I’ve seen the evidence and he committed multiple crimes. Even if his appeal is successful in the federal case, there is additional evidence of criminal acts that are included in the state’s indictment.”
If convicted on state charges and appeals fail, it would take an act of the governor to clear him of that.
Previously, Pullins told us in an interview that the team is hoping to leverage Householder’s close relationship with Trump to get him out.
Asked about the appearance that Householder could be using his connections in order to get out of prison, Pullins responded, “Well, yeah. He is. Hopefully, he has some friends left that can help.”
After our exclusive, in-depth interview in 2023, we’ve kept in touch with the head juror, Jerrod Haines, who convicted Householder in federal court.
He said that Householder was, once again, using power to get what he wanted.
“I definitely feel like he is using his connections to skip his sentence,” he said. “I would feel that the justice system failed if he would be pardoned. I would feel that my time as a juror was wasted, even though I think it was a very valuable experience for me, my life was interrupted for seven weeks.”
Haines told us in 2023 that he was left disillusioned with state government, hoping political leaders would finally learn not to undercut their citizens in exchange for power and money.

(Getty Images)More West Virginia students are completing the college financial aid application, known as the FAFSA, following pandemic interruptions and nationwide issues with the form over the last year. 
According to data tracked by the National College Attainment Network, the state’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid completion rate stands at 49.8%.
The state now ranks 15th in the nation for students completing the FAFSA, which is up from 19th last year, according to a news release from the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission.
Brian Weingart, senior director of financial aid at the commission, said the HEPC has worked side-by-side with schools, counselors and communities to make sure students had “a clever path to financial aid.” HEPC credits the success to statewide partnerships. 
“Whether it’s through hands-on FAFSA events, real-time data tools, or text message nudges, we’re meeting students where they are and helping them take that critical next step toward college. Behind every completed FAFSA is a student who’s one step closer to their future,” he said.
The federal government’s 2024 botched rollout of the new FAFSA form prompted former Gov. Jim Justice to declare a state of emergency and suspended a requirement that college-bound high school seniors fill out the FAFSA in order to receive state financial aid, including the state’s Promise Scholarship.
Unlike some other states, West Virginia didn’t have a statewide FAFSA mandate. Instead, the HEPC said it focused on strategic outreach and community engagement. 
A WV FAFSA day in February brought together more than 50 high schools and colleges. The organization also used “TXT 4 Success,” a text message program that provides personalized guidance and nudges to help students stay on track with financial aid deadlines.
“West Virginia’s success, and approach, offer a lot for other communities and states to learn from,” said Bill DeBaun, senior director at the National College Attainment Network in Washington. “Thoughtful, coordinated efforts like these that support practitioners in districts and schools make a big difference.”
West Virginia’s Chancellor of Higher Education Dr. Sarah Armstrong Tucker added, “We built momentum through strong partnerships with our schools and counselors, innovative tools and a shared commitment to our students’ futures. I am deeply proud of our team and the many school counselors, educators, and families who have rallied around this cause. Together, we’re showing what’s possible when we put students first.”

Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — An inmate slated for execution on one of his two death sentences chose to die by lethal injection soon after the state Supreme Court declined to require more information about execution methods.
The execution of 57-year-old Stephen Stanko is set to take place at 6 p.m. June 13. His would be the sixth execution in the state since the process resumed in September, following a state Supreme Court ruling that firing squad and electrocution were constitutional.
Two of those inmates selected firing squad as the way they wished to die. Three died by lethal injection. Inmates also have the option of electrocution, which none have chosen since 2008.
  Stephen Stanko, 57, is scheduled to be executed June 13. (Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)
Attorneys for Stanko, who was sentenced to death in two separate cases for crimes committed within two days of each other, asked for more information about the state’s protocols for firing squad and lethal injection, arguing the most recent firing squad execution in April didn’t go the way prison officials planned.
The state Supreme Court turned down that request Wednesday, writing that attorneys failed to prove anything went wrong during that execution or previous ones carried out using lethal injection.
Two bullets struck Mahdi in the same spot in his chest, causing the two wounds instead of the three defense attorneys expected, prison officials and attorneys for the state have said. Those bullets then took the same route through Mahdi’s body, including striking part of his heart.
A pathologist hired by defense attorneys for both Mahdi and Stanko compared Mahdi’s autopsy report to a previous one in which inmate Brad Sigmon’s heart was completely destroyed, unlike in Mahdi’s case, where most of the damage seemed limited to other organs.
If that was the case, it doesn’t seem to be because the Department of Corrections failed to follow protocols, justices wrote in the Wednesday order. Various factors, including whether Mahdi shifted in the chair to which he was strapped, could have moved the target and caused the marksmen to not strike his heart precisely.
The justices also turned down attorneys’ arguments that the state failed to follow its own protocols during previous lethal injection executions by administering a second dose of the sedative pentobarbital after 10 minutes. That second dose is written into the state’s protocol, which is not released publicly, justices wrote.
Stanko’s crime spree started April 7, 2005, when he strangled his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death at her home in Murrell’s Inlet while beating and raping her 15-year-old daughter, according to court documents. Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before stealing jewelry and credit cards and fleeing.
He went to his friend’s house in Conway. After having breakfast with his friend Henry Turner, Stanko shot the 74-year-old in the back while he shaved in the bathroom mirror, using a pillow as a silencer for his gun, according to court documents.
Stanko then hit Turner in the head and fatally shot him in the chest.
Driving Turner’s truck, Stanko went to Columbia, where he spent an evening buying people drinks at bars before traveling to Augusta, Georgia. There, Stanko convinced a woman he was a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament and went home with her, according to court records.
Stanko stayed with the woman, including attending church with her, until April 12, when he left abruptly in the middle of the night. Soon after he left, the woman recognized his photo in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death and called the police, who captured Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
During Stanko’s trials, defense attorneys argued to no avail that he was insane at the time of the killings, with decreased brain functioning making him unable to understand right and wrong.
A jury convicted Stanko in 2006 of killing Ling and beating and raping her daughter. A separate jury convicted him in 2009 of killing Turner. Both juries recommended death sentences, which multiple courts have affirmed.
Turner’s killing is the crime for which Stanko is set to be put to death in June.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

Now a formal notification of its 'noncompliance' with federal immigration policy is forthcoming, says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Exactly what court order the Trump administration is using to base its declaration that Rhode Island is defying federal immigration policy remains a mystery. But the head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has a theory.
The state as well as Providence and Central Falls are on a list of 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” that may lose federal funding released Thursday night by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The list was compiled based on factors like noncompliance with federal law enforcement, information-sharing restrictions, and giving legal protections to undocumented immigrants, the department’s website stated.
The website also states that Rhode Island made the list because of a “Court Order Requiring State Sanctuary Requirements.” Rhode Island Current reached out to Homeland Security for specific details and received a statement reiterating the designation factors on the department’s website. 
Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, hypothesized that the federal government may be citing a 2014 federal court order that ruled police officers in Rhode Island cannot hold a person in custody based upon an U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer alone for more than 48 hours.
“It’s a very basic Fourth Amendment law,” Brown said in an interview. “And it appears the Trump administration is upset that the Constitution prevents them from doing what they want to do.”
The Department of Homeland Security’s list was published as part of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump April 28 mandating federal officials identify and publicly highlight jurisdictions that “refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”
“These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Thursday. “We are exposing these sanctuary politicians who harbor criminal illegal aliens and defy federal law.”
The announcement from the Department of Homeland Security states each jurisdiction on the list will receive a formal notification of its “noncompliance” with federal policy and must immediately review and revise its policies to align with the Trump administration.
No notices received yet
Gov. Dan McKee’s office has not received any notification as of Friday, said spokesperson Olivia DaRocha. Officials in Central Falls and Providence said their cities have not received any notice either.
“As we have always stated, Rhode Island cooperates with ICE on the lawful detention of criminals in accordance with a binding federal court ruling,” DaRocha said in an emailed statement, referring to the 2014 court order.
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said in a statement that he has no plans to change the city’s existing policy regarding immigration. Police officers are prohibited from asking about someone’s immigration status and from holding a subject “based exclusively” on an administrative detainer, nor are they allowed to arrest suspected undocumented individuals unless federal immigration officers provide a criminal warrant signed by a judge.
“The Providence Police are not and will not be immigration officers and are better able to keep our community safe with this policy,” Smiley said. “Providence remains committed to being a safe and welcoming city for all.”

Central Falls in 2019 enacted its own ordinance that prohibits local police officers from questioning people about their immigration status without probable cause, bar any compliance with detainer requests made without a warrant, and ensure municipal services are available to all residents regardless of their citizenship.
Central Falls Mayor Maria Rivera in a statement said her city stands by its values and community. 
“Our ordinance is legal and makes our city safer –– building a stronger foundation for public trust in our local police department,” Rivera said. “Together with the city of Providence, we won this fight before during the first Trump Administration.”
Rivera was referring to a 2018 lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over requirements that recipients of a federal criminal-justice grant, known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, cooperate with authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration law.
U.S. District Court Judge Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in favor of the cities in 2019, which was upheld by a federal appeals court in Boston in 2020.
But the chairman of Rhode Island’s Republican Party said the state’s placement on the list was the result of “deliberate, reckless choices” by the governor and city officials.
“Let’s be clear, this isn’t compassion, it’s capitulation,” party chairman Joe Powers said in a statement. “McKee is harboring those who break federal law while turning his back on those who enforce it.” 
“President Trump is standing up to this nonsense,” he continued.
Brown, however, maintains that there’s not legitimate basis from the federal government that Rhode Island or any municipalities are violating federal law. 
“They’re not, they’re upholding the law,” he said.

House Bill 1217, signed into law this month by Gov. Bob Ferguson, restricts annual residential rent increases to 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower.
The state Department of Commerce calculated the former option as 10.8%. Since that’s above the threshold, rent increases are capped at 10% through the end of 2025.
The maximum allowable increase for 2026 is expected to be published in July, based on inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The highly divisive legislation went into effect immediately after Ferguson’s signature. 
Democrats hope the new cap provides greater predictability to tenants whose lives can be turned upside down by major rent increases. Progressives had initially pushed for a hard 7% limit, but raised it to win over moderate Democrats in the Legislature.
Republicans termed the bill “rent control” and argued it would chill development and price out small landlords. After the governor signed the new law, the Rental Housing Association of Washington said it was exploring a legal challenge.
Rent hikes are no longer allowed in the first year of a tenancy under the law either.
Not all rental properties are subject to the cap. 
New construction is not covered for its first 12 years. Public housing authorities, low-income developments, and duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in which the owner lives in one of the units are also exempt.
Notices of rent increases are now required 90 days before they go into effect, up from 60 days under previous law.
Increases are capped at 5% for manufactured homes.
If a landlord raises rent above the caps without an exemption, the renter must give the landlord a chance to fix the error or can terminate their lease with 20 days’ notice. A tenant or the state attorney general can bring litigation to enforce compliance. The attorney general can recover up to $7,500 per violation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

The department released the list as part of an executive order signed by President Donald Trump requiring that sanctuary jurisdictions across the country be listed. 
“Sanctuary jurisdictions including cities, counties, and states that are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities,” the DHS announcement states. “Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril.” 
Dane County, Madison and Milwaukee have enacted policies that limit local law enforcement agencies’ collaboration with federal immigration authorities. Earlier this year, Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett announced that the county would no longer participate in a program that provides funding in exchange for telling federal agencies when an immigrant without legal status is in custody in the local jail. Milwaukee also refuses to share such information. 
“DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,” DHS stated.
But Shawano County, which Trump won with 67% of its vote last year, is a Republican Party stronghold that appears out of place on the list. The DHS announcement states that “no one should act on this information without conducting their own evaluation of the information.” 
In 2021, the Shawano County board voted to declare the county a “Second Amendment sanctuary county,” which declared the county sheriff would not enforce any laws which “unconstitutionally impedes our fundamental Second Amendment right to Keep and Bear Arms.” 
The Shawano County administrator and sheriff did not respond to requests for comment.

(Getty Images)Granite Staters continue to overwhelmingly cite the scarcity of affordable housing as the most pressing concern, a new poll from the University of New Hampshire suggests.
Faced with a range of options that included taxes, education, jobs, and cost of living, 36% of respondents to the poll said housing is “the most important problem facing New Hampshire” — far and away the biggest share. The next highest category was taxes; 10% of respondents chose that as the most important issue.
But when it comes to the most likely legislative approach to address the housing shortfall this year, residents are more divided.
The poll, released Thursday, asked respondents whether they support legislation that would require cities and towns to relax their zoning policies to make it easier to build a home. Thirty-eight percent supported that legislation — 15% strongly — but 40% opposed it. Of those that were against it, 18% were strongly opposed.
The response comes as the Republican-led Legislature has passed a pair of bills that would bar municipalities from making certain zoning restrictions; both bills are making their way to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
House Bill 631 would require municipalities to allow multi-family developments in commercial zones, such as shopping areas. And House Bill 577 would allow homeowners to build a detached accessory dwelling unit by right and expand the size limitations to do so.
The issue of housing scarcity dominated both Democratic and Republican campaign platforms in 2024, and lawmakers in both parties have found common ground in legislation that would forcibly remove local zoning barriers to housing. 
Some groups, such as the New Hampshire Municipal Association, are opposed to those bills, arguing that cities and towns should be able to craft their own zoning codes and should react to the housing shortage with approaches supported by their residents. 
Republican lawmakers have shown less support this year for devoting state resources to encourage more development; the House-passed budget would eliminate the Housing Champion Program, a 2023 effort to give special grants and state support to towns that voluntarily changed their zoning codes to be more friendly to housing. House and Senate lawmakers have also blocked efforts to increase the amount of money going to the state’s affordable housing fund, which is currently allocated $5 million of state tax revenues per year. 
The May 29 UNH poll was released three months after a poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of Housing Action New Hampshire, a housing advocacy group, appeared to show more support for zoning changes. 
In that poll, conducted March 3 to 10, more than 75% of respondents supported policies to “allow more homes near business and shopping districts,” allow “flexibility for paved parking areas,” “allow homes on slightly smaller lots,” and “make it easier to build accessory dwelling units.” The Housing Action poll also found that 54% of respondents said building more homes is more important for New Hampshire than protecting the character of neighborhoods from change, compared to 35% who said the opposite and 11% who were not sure. 
The Housing Action poll worded its questions differently than the UNH poll; the former poll asked about legislation that would “allow” homeowners to build certain structures, while the latter poll asked about legislation that would “require” cities and towns to change their zoning codes to achieve that.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-30 18:57:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lexington residents urge court to scrutinize police abuse claims,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/30/lexington-residents-urge-court-to-scrutinize-police-abuse-claims/,Lexington residents ask federal appeals court to hear oral arguments on police abuse claims.,"Lexington community members joined attorneys and the National Police Accountability Project to urge a federal appeals court to consider evidence in a civil rights lawsuit against the police department alleging a pattern of violent, racist and unconstitutional policing practices. 
A Wednesday filing asks the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to hold oral arguments to consider evidence presented at a 2022 hearing and legal arguments that the U.S. District Court overlooked the evidence in dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims. 
Attorneys for the Black Lexington residents who claim they have been stopped at checkpoints, falsely arrested and retaliated against by members of the police department say the plaintiffs had proper standing, their claims were proper and some claims were dismissed without properly analyzing evidence. 
“For those reasons, Malcolm Stewart, Darious Harris, and Robert Harris respectfully request that the judgment of the district court be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings,” the May 28 appellant’s brief states. 
The original lawsuit, filed in August 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missisisppi, documented conduct by the former white police chief, Sam Dobbins, who was fired in 2022 after bragging on a recording about killing 13 people while working as a law enforcement officer and using racial and homophobic slurs. 
That complaint also shows the conduct of his successor, Chief Charles Henderson, who is Black and has overseen a department that allegedly is violent against residents and has used roadblocks to exclusively target Black neighborhoods. 
Lexington, located in one of the state’s poorest counties, has a population of less than 2,000 people and is 86% Black. The city’s mayor is white and its aldermen are Black. 
The original lawsuit plaintiffs are brothers Robert and Darius Harris, Malcolm Stewart, Eric Redmond and Peter Reeves. Dobbins, Henderson, the police department and the city were named as defendants in the lawsuit. Later, four police officers were added as defendants. 
“This case is about more than a few rogue officers — it’s about a police department functioning as a tool of racial control and abuse,” Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said in a statement.
Attorneys from the organization, along with attorney Jill Collen Jefferson of JULIAN and others are representing the appellants.
Bonds said the violations have persisted and escalated, which underscores why the organization’s clients are continuing with the case and why it remains critical.  
In 2022, plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order against the Lexington Police Department to prevent them from violating Black residents’ civil rights and prevent violence against them, but a federal judge denied it.
Over the next two years the district court dismissed a majority of the plaintiffs claims, and two plaintiffs remained with claims against the officers, Dobbins and Henderson. 
In January, U.S. District Judge Tom Lee approved an agreed judgment between plaintiff Redmond and the defendants and dismissed all claims brought by the remaining plaintiffs. This is the decision being appealed with the 5th Circuit Court. 
Since 2022, there have been other federal lawsuits brought by Lexington residents against Dobbins, Henderson, the city and the police department. Most of those remain active in the district court or the 5th Circuit. 
In a Wednesday statement, the National Police Accountability Project said the Lexington lawsuit by the five men is an example of an urgent need for local and federal action to stop law enforcement abuse in the South and across the country. 
Last week, the Trump administration rolled back federal oversight of police departments by ending consent decrees and halting investigations. 
The Justice Department under the Biden administration opened a civil rights investigation into the Lexington police, but it did not result in a consent decree. 
The New Orleans Police Department had a consent decree that lasted from 2011 to 2024.
Bonds said the Trump administration’s move is a “deliberate slap in the face to the memory of George Floyd” close to the 5-year anniversary of his death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. 
She also said the move is an attempt to disempower Black communities, shut down paths to accountability and silence resistance. 
“But let us be clear: We are not backing down. We are doubling down,” Bonds said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06150937/AP_22228581950173-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Maine lawmakers will wait to take action on proposed legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases.
The Legislature’s Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to carry over LD 208, a proposal from House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) to repeal the law passed just last year that requires someone who sells a firearm to wait three days before delivering it to the buyer. 
However, the committee was divided on whether to carry over an identical bill, LD 1230, with Democrats voting in support and Republicans opposed. The votes taken Friday were not an absolute, but rather a request of the presiding officers who have the final say on what will be carried over.
After the waiting period took effect in August, opponents filed a lawsuit in November claiming it violates the Second Amendment rights of people who have passed background checks. 
Earlier this year, a U.S. District Court judge sided with the gun rights advocates and temporarily paused the waiting period. Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey appealed the decision, but a federal appeals court last week refused to reinstate the waiting period while the lawsuit unfolds. 
Over the past few weeks, Senate co-chair Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) encouraged the committee to carry over Faulkingham’s bill and kill the other proposal to streamline the committee’s work and allow time for the legal process to play out before making any changes. 
However, multiple Republicans on the committee said they did not want their names on the record as voting against the bill. 
“I’m not going to have my name on that report and follow me forever,” said Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan), though she agreed it’s important to carry over one of the bills in case changes need to be made.
Stuck at a stalemate, Carney suggested Friday that the committee vote to carry over both bills, but Republicans also raised concerns with this approach. 
Committees are only allowed to carry over a limited number of bills from the first to second session, so some Republicans were concerned carrying over identical proposals would waste one of those slots and lead to Senate president and speaker of the House of Representatives killing one of the bills. 
“Why can’t we have a conversation on the floor?” asked Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), encouraging the committee to advance LD 1230 this session 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), who voted to carry over both proposals, said his understanding was that the committee decided to not work on either bill while the lawsuit is ongoing. Since the committee hasn’t fully workshopped the bills, Lee said sending one to the chamber floors wouldn’t make sense.

Jared Polis speaks during a news conference about a bipartisan property tax reduction bill on May 6, 2024, at the Colorado Capitol. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline) Colorado Democratic lawmakers criticized Gov. Jared Polis after he vetoed a bill on Thursday afternoon that would have banned the use of computer algorithms to set rent in the state, calling the decision a failure of the state’s values.
“Gov. Polis had the opportunity to save Coloradans money, but he instead aligned himself with tech companies that are engaged in practices so questionable that they’re currently facing litigation from the federal government,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat and bill sponsor, said during a virtual press conference on Friday morning.
House Bill 25-1004 was written as a consumer protection bill to ban software that uses private market data to suggest profit-maximizing rents to landlords.
The Biden administration released a report last year that found software from companies like RealPage cost Denver renters an extra $136 per month, one of the highest monthly cost increases in the country, and is used in over 45% of multifamily rental units in the city.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser last year also targeted the practice when he joined an antitrust lawsuit against RealPage.
In his veto letter, Polis wrote that he prefers to allow “current state and federal investigations to run their course — including those Colorado is a party to.”
He wrote that he agrees with the intent of the bill, and that collusion to artificially constrain rental supply is already illegal, but he worried about its effect on the state’s housing market.
“We should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing,” he wrote. “If signed today, this bill may have unintended consequences of creating a hostile environment for providers of rental housing and could result in further diminished supply of rental housing based on inadequate data.”
A RealPage spokesperson lauded Polis’ veto.
“This is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,” Jennifer Bowcock of RealPage said in a statement.
The bill was sponsored by Gonzales, Sen. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo, Rep. Steven Woodrow of Denver and Rep. Javier Mabrey of Denver, all Democrats. A similar bill died last year, but this year’s version passed on party-line votes in both legislative chambers.
“During my time at the Legislature, we’ve been tasked by the governor to save people money,” Woodrow said. “During special sessions, we’ve been called down to cut property taxes to save homeowners an average of $80. Why we couldn’t find the means to save renters 200 times that with a stroke of a pen is simply beyond unfortunate. The governor has punted this to the courts.”
Groups that supported the bill included the Community Economic Defense Project, The Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute and United for a New Economy. Supporters hoped the Biden White House report and pending litigation would help usher it into law this year.
“Unfortunately, the veto sends this devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from the people who have the least,” CEDP co-founder Sam Gilman said.
The veto is Polis’ 11th this year. He has until June 6 to sign or veto bills passed during this year’s legislative session, which concluded earlier this month.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The legislative session, which ended Friday, was a mixed bag for Gov. Kevin Stitt.
He got his income tax cut, business courts and ban on cellphones in schools, prompting him to say Wednesday it was probably the best session in his seven years in office.
“Look. The governor should be very happy,” House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said early Friday. “He got everything he wanted this session.”
But then came Thursday, effectively the final day of the legislative session. 
Lawmakers removed his embattled mental health commissioner and spent hours overriding dozens of his vetoes, including House Bill 1389, which expands insurance coverage for diagnostic mammograms.
Stitt panned both the veto overrides and Friesen’s firing.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters didn’t fare well, watching lawmakers and Stitt halt his efforts to require citizenship status checks for students and the completion of the  naturalization test for teachers. They also balked at his $3 million request to purchase Bibles for public school classrooms.
But lawmakers stopped short of putting the kibosh on his controversial social studies standards, dictating what must be taught in school, and which have already drawn a court challenge. 
The standards include language requiring students be taught about unfounded 2020 election “discrepancies,” the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and Bible stories.
Democrats said they were largely left out of the budget process.
While Stitt championed it, Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said the .25% income tax reduction was the worst bill of the session. It cuts the top bracket from 4.75% to 4.5% and contains a pathway toward eliminating the tax entirely.
“It is going to undermine our options as a state,” Kirt said.
Stitt let the general appropriations bill, outlining the state’s nearly $12.6 billion budget, take effect without his signature.
The budget gives most agencies a flat budget, but provides $250 million for the Oklahoma State University veterinary school and $200 million for a University of Oklahoma pediatric heart hospital.
Perhaps one of the most controversial measures passed and signed into law was a bill putting more restrictions on the process voters use to get things on the ballot.
Senate Bill 1027, which among other things implements restrictions on the number of people who can sign initiative petitions, is expected to draw a legal challenge.
Sports betting failed to get across the finish line for yet another year.
A bill that would have barred synthetic dyes and over a dozen other ingredients from food got left on the cutting room floor, as did a measure requiring a Ten Commandments display at the Capitol.
A bill that would add items to Oklahoma’s back-to-school sales tax holiday didn’t muster the support needed for passage nor did a measure that would have made Nov. 5 President Donald J. Trump Day in Oklahoma.

On a Friday press call, landowners urged Reynolds to uphold Iowa and GOP values around property rights by signing the bill into law. 
House File 639 advanced from the Senate May 13, following four years of effort from a group of landowners and House lawmakers. The bill would do a number of things including require carbon sequestration projects prove they are a common carrier, in order to use eminent domain. 
The legislation, and landowner support, comes largely in response to a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline project, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, that would connect to nearly 60 ethanol plants and pipe the sequestered carbon dioxide through Iowa and surrounding states to underground storage in North Dakota.

Those opposed to the project say a private company should not be given the right to condemn agricultural land. South Dakotans recently codified that opinion with a law that specifically bans CO2 pipelines from the right of eminent domain, which has caused Summit to reevaluate its path through the state. 
Marty Maher, an affected landowner from Montgomery County, urged Reynolds to uphold the Iowa Republican platform, which opposes the use of eminent domain by the use of a private party or for-profit entity. 
“Do party platforms mean anything to the elected Republican officials, or are platforms just feel-good projects for the party faithful?” Maher asked. 
Maher said the bill “levels the playing field” between landowners, neighbors and the utilities commission.
“I am sure that you want to be remembered as the governor that supported common sense property rights in Iowa and leveled the playing field for all residents in the state for many years to come,” Maher said, addressing his comments to the governor. 
Mary Powell, a Shelby County landowner, shared a similar sentiment and recalled times the governor quoted Iowa’s motto, “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain.” 
“Like many Iowans, I appreciate Gov. Reynolds stating the Iowa motto is a belief and not empty words, but Iowans need action,” Powell said. “We need Gov. Reynolds to sign 639 into law.” 
Reynolds said last week on Iowa Press she was meeting with stakeholders on both sides to determine her stance on the bill.
Another Shelby County landowner, Cindy Hansen, said on the Friday call that she and other landowners met with the governor and her advisory team Thursday evening to share their point of view. 
Hansen said the governor did not ask any questions or give an indication as to how she would act, but did listen to the landowners’ perspective.
The bill would also increase the insurance requirements for CO2 pipeline operators to cover any accidental or intentional discharges and any insurance rate increases landowners face because of the pipeline. The bill additionally requires Iowa Utilities Commissioners to be present at all hearings and expands the scope of who may intervene in IUC proceedings.
Meghan Sloma, said on Friday’s call that as a neighbor to the pipeline, she was not allowed to testify in the IUC hearings because it didn’t go through her property, even though she would be “very much affected” by the pipeline. 
“I think that’s very important, that the right that I have for my voice to be heard regarding what happens to my land, that it be protected,” Sloma said. “To me, it is just basic fairness and equality.” 
Sloma said while the pipeline project brought up the need for this legislation, the bill is not “anti pipeline” or “anti progress.” 
Opponents of the bill include farming organizations like Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, who argue the legislation would stop Iowa from entering the ultra-low carbon ethanol market. 
This loss of market, they argue, would in turn hurt Iowa farmers and the state’s economy. IRFA also argued in a press conference last week, that the bill has a slew of “unintended negative consequences.”

Ingham County Judge Molly Hennessey Greenwalt heard arguments from the defense for Lee and Stephanie Chatfield and the Michigan Attorney General’s Office in February, determining this week that there was probable cause for the charges and the case should proceed to trial.
The Michigan Attorney General’s Office contends that through investigatory efforts by authorities beginning in 2021, it was discovered that the Chatfields had for years used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at souvenir shops at Universal Studios during a family trip, transactions at retail stores like Coach and expenses at a strip club, amongst other expenditures.
The Chatfields’ attorney Mary Chartier has asserted that the charges brought against the former House Speaker, a prominent Republican in Michigan who raised millions of dollars while he was Speaker, are rooted in the political agenda for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat.

The investigation into Lee Chatfield began back in December 2021, when his sister-in-law, Rebekah Chatfield, reported to police in Lansing that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting  when she was 14 or 15 years old. Michigan State Police opened an investigation into the report, also looking into financial behavior, which was later taken over by Nessel’s office which did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges for criminal sexual conduct.
Lee Chatfield faces 13 felony counts of crimes related to conducting a criminal enterprise, conspiracy and embezzlement, while his wife faces two felony counts.
Nessel released a news statement Friday expressing gratitude that the efforts of her office led to the case moving forward to trial after a long investigation period and legal process.
“Our investigation uncovered extensive evidence of elaborate schemes to embezzle and misappropriate private and public funds to bankroll Lee Chatfield’s lifestyle during his time as Speaker of the House,” Nessel said in the statement. “My office will continue to pursue public corruption with every tool at our disposal and push for stronger transparency and good governance in our state.”

According to the board, Dr. Joshwa Tromblee “exchanged inappropriate messages” with a female patient he first saw at MercyOne’s Centerville Medical Center on Sept. 24, 2021. Tromblee was a family-medicine physician at that time.
Tromblee saw the patient again on Aug. 8, 2022, and April 3, 2023. The patient subsequently sent Tromblee a Facebook friend request, after which the two exchanged messages on Facebook and Snapchat. The exchanges included “sexually inappropriate messages and sexually explicit pictures,” the board alleges.
Tromblee also sent the patient money on one occasion, according to the board. At some point, MercyOne reviewed Tromblee’s social media exchanges with the patient and determined he had violated the standard of conduct and crossed a line by engaging in an inappropriate patient-physician relationship. He was placed on paid administrative leave on April 12, 2023, and was fired nine days later, according to the board.
Twenty-three months later – one week after Tromblee’s license expired — the Board of Medicine charged Tromblee with sexual misconduct and, at the same time, agreed to a settlement to resolve the case.
The settlement entails an indefinite suspension of Tromblee’s license. He is required to schedule a multidisciplinary fitness-for-duty assessment within 30 days, and to comply with any and all recommendations stemming from the evaluation.
He also is required to complete a course on professional ethics. Once reinstated, his license will be placed on probation for three years.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/BOARD-OF-MEDICINE.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)It was a marathon week of voting. Debates were had, gavels were broken, and senators took a break from policy to discuss what sort of vehicle they would be if given the choice (Sen. Craig Hickman, a train; Sen. Mark Lawrence, a submarine; Sen. Joe Baldacci, a “big red firetruck,” etc.) 
In many cases, the Maine Senate and House of Representatives split over whether to support legislation. Often this would kick off a series of votes and if neither backed down from their position (“recede and concur”) the bill would ultimately die.
Here’s a look at what passed, what didn’t, and what’s still in limbo.
Bills that passed:
Following the Senate last week, the House voted 108-33 to back LD 1219, which provides the University of Maine System a 6% funding increase for the next two fiscal years. 
House and Senate members voted in favor of a bill (LD 60) that would allow employees to request a flexible work schedule. Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford), who voted against the measure, said it could be devastating for farmers and isn’t necessary since current law doesn’t prohibit someone from making such a request but Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said there are many situations where an employer can deny a request but the bill is mostly about ensuring employees aren’t retaliated against for asking.
The chambers also passed a bill (LD 61) regulating employer surveillance of employees.
The House and Senate voted in favor of legislation (LD 1462) that prevents municipalities from adopting ordinances that prohibit vendors of expressive material, like books, writings, visual art, though it allows for the adoption of restrictions on time, place and manner of vending.
Both chambers backed LD 1017, which would reimburse shelters for the cost of providing food served at emergency shelters. The system currently reimburses shelters for the cost of issuing food vouchers but not providing meals themselves. (Read more about the issue here).
The House voted 78-62 to back an amended proposal (LD 784) to establish a “rebuttal presumption” — a legal assumption — in the event that a health insurance company denies coverage for specialized risk screening for a first responder whose provider has determined the screening is medically appropriate. An earlier version of the bill required health coverage of the screening, which would have carried a fiscal note. The Senate placed the measure on the appropriations table.
Both chambers unanimously backed a provision (LD 1234) that requires school boards to adopt a policy related to use of personal electronic devices during the school day.
Lawmakers backed legislation (LD 946) that would require the Efficiency Maine Trust to ensure that at least half of all available funding for electric vehicle rebates and incentives for weatherization and heat pumps is distributed to low-and moderate-income residents.
LD 1420, which would establish the Commission to Ensure a Just and Equitable Energy Transition for Maine’s Workforce, passed both the House and Senate.
Both chambers ultimately passed a bill (LD 301) that would allow the Public Utilities Commission to establish performance-based metrics and rate-adjustment mechanisms for a public utility. The Senate voted to pass an amended version of the bill after it was first rejected by the House last week. (Read about a similar proposal last session).
Another bill that had split the chambers but now passed is LD 1159, An Act to Prohibit Governmental Entities That Charge a Fee for In-person Credit Card Purchases from Refusing to Accept Cash.
Both chambers voted under the hammer to back legislation (LD 1425) to provide additional funding for two years to the Maine Resiliency Center in Lewiston to support the continuation and expansion of services for residents of the State affected by trauma.
Lawmakers also unanimously approved a bill (LD 1445) that would authorize an accredited financial institution to report suspected financial exploitation of a senior to the Office of the Attorney General. 
Rejected legislation:
House members voted 75-66 and senators voted 19-15 to reject a resolution (LD 1437) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to specify that only U.S. citizens can vote in state or local elections. While supporters pointed to a past effort in Portland to expand the vote in municipal elections to all residents regardless of citizenship, Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) reiterated to her colleagues that “only citizens can vote in Maine elections. That is not disputed, that is not unclear, that is not ambiguous.” She added, “Let us not spend our time chasing ghosts or entertaining conspiracy theories that seek to erode public trust in our democratic institutions.”
Lawmakers also rejected a bill (LD 1329) that would include U.S. citizenship status on driver’s licenses and nondrive ID cards. Debate over the measure turned into a back and forth over whether noncitizens are voting in Maine elections, something Supica said is a myth. 
A majority of both chambers rejected a Republican proposal (LD 1331) to amend the state constitution so that if the Legislature adjourns “sine die,” or finally, the governor can’t reconvene the body for 90 days. (Read more about the bill here).
Both the House and Senate​​ rejected LD 160, which would eliminate REAL ID requirements in Maine. (Read more about the issue here).
Lawmakers voted against a bill (LD 112) to allow employers to pay high school students 50% of the state’s minimum wage for up to two years or until they graduate, which critics said would create a subclass of workers. (Read more about the proposal here).
Both chambers also opted against a bill (LD 853) that would divide the state’s counties into three regions and replace the statewide minimum hourly wage with a wage based on the cost of living in those regions. (Read more about the proposal here).
Following passage in both chambers, less than two-thirds of the House voted to enact LD 197, an emergency resolve directing the Governor’s Energy Office to Conduct a study regarding the future of electric transmission infrastructure in the state.
Both the House and Senates voted against legislation (LD 1288) that would amend certain provisions of Maine’s drug laws to expand the definition and possession amounts for what constitutes trafficking of heroin, fentanyl and cocaine.
After bouncing between chambers for weeks, a provision (LD 771) to amend the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances failed after chambers failed to agree on the matter, with the Senate opposed and the House in support of the bill. Supporters said the change addressed a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances. 
The majority of lawmakers voted against a measure (LD 1024) that would expand the list of crimes that do not qualify for immunity under Maine’s Good Samaritan law, which concerns drug-related medical assistance. Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) said the bill would weaken provisions passed in 2022 and inject confusion, hesitation and fear. Every overdose is a tragedy, she said, but the decline from 2022 to 2024 offers hope. 
Another bill that died after the chambers failed to agree is LD 16, which would have established separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine. 
Legislation (LD 639) that would remove the Maine Criminal Justice Academy’s law enforcement training program’s residential requirement ultimately died after the chambers split with the Senate in support and House opposed to the bill. 
Lawmakers voted with the committee recommendation to reject a proposal (LD 724) to recognize the two main festivals in Islam, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as state holidays.
LD 53, which would have established the November General Election Day as a school holiday for school buildings used as voting places, also failed after the chambers were unable to agree on the measure. 
House and Senate lawmakers voted to kill a bill (LD 775) to require voter approval of legislative and gubernatorial pay increases.
Lawmakers voted under the hammer to reject a bill (LD 1214), which would designate the Second Congressional District “Acadia.”
House lawmakers voted 76-65 and the Senate 20-15 to reject a bill (LD 1395) that would require that digital resources offered by schools must prevent a user from accessing obscene material. Though sponsor Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport) said the bill would protect children from obscene content and the growing threat of human trafficking, Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough) said that after hearing testimony from school information specialists and others, that this is already happening, filters are in place, and “school employees, staff, and administrators are looking out for kids when they are online.”
Both chambers rejected legislation (LD 885) that would allow those with a concealed carry permit to possess or discharge a firearm on school property. During debate, proponents noted this would only apply to those who completed the background check and adequate training. However, Rep. Kelly Noonan Murphy (D-Scarborough) said that if the bill passed and there was a situation on a school campus, there could be confusion about who should respond. 
The majority of the House and Senate voted against a bill (LD 1586) that would require the dollar amount of a school budget to be included on a budget validation referendum.
Both chambers rejected an effort (LD 1536) to roll back changes made to the state bail code in 2021.
Lawmakers voted in favor of the committee recommendation against LD 855, which would limit eligibility under the Maine Clean Election Act. Bill sponsor Rep. Davis Boyer (R-Poland) argued that the program should be available to candidates who need it most, not millionaires. 
With a 85-57 vote in the House and 21-13 vote in the Senate, lawmakers rejected legislation (LD 671) that would abolish the Maine income tax and establish a zero-based budget. 
A bill (LD 309) that would allow a political party to determine how its nominee is selected in a primary failed. Sponsor Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland) explained this would allow members of a party to decide if they want to use ranked-choice voting, a plurality, or “cornhole” to elect its nominee. 
Both the House and Senate overrode the majority of the committee by voting against a measure (LD 551) that would reign in some of the emergency powers of the executive branch. (Read about a similar bill here, which also died).
The Legislature voted against a bill (LD 1405) that would eliminate some of the authority granted to the Public Utilities Commission concerning participant funding.
Both chambers also rejected a bill (LD 732) that would prohibit the use of copyright protection for any work of the state except for merchandise sold by a department or agency.
Two bills that sought to restart a conversation around universal health care in Maine (LD 1269 and LD 1883) were unanimously opposed by the financial services committee and killed under the hammer in the chambers. (Read more about the bills here)
Limbo:
Legislation (LD 1022) to increase funding for the civil legal services fund, which supports the provision of free legal services to low-income defendants, passed both chambers but during the House enactment vote did not garner two-thirds support needed for the emergency bill to take effect. It has been placed on the appropriations table.
LD 525 is in limbo after the Senate split (17-17) and then tabled the measure, after the House narrowly rejected the proposal, which would clarify that someone has the right to discharge a firearm within 500 feet of school property if acting in self defense of their property.
The chambers are also split over a bill (LD 1063), with the Senate opposed and House in support, that would require the Public Utilities Commission to direct utilities to enter into contracts with generators fueled by municipal solid waste. Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said the state is in a conundrum because folks don’t like burning trash to produce energy, but that trash is being landfilled, which people don’t like either. Critics argued the bill is poorly written and shifts the cost of these facilities from taxpayers to ratepayers. 
The chambers are at odds over a provision (LD 218) that would make student transfer agreements renew automatically, except in certain circumstances related to attendance or behavior, with the Senate in support and the House opposed.
These emergency bills have been enacted by more than two-thirds of both chambers and will take effect immediately upon the governor’s signature:

LD 23 – An Act to Extend the Period of Time a Dentist May Operate the Practice of a Deceased or Incapacitated Dentist 
LD 228 -An Act to Allow Coastal Seawalls to Be Raised by up to 2 Feet in Order to Accommodate Predicted Sea Level Rise

*See below for a more complete list of bills that passed the Legislature this week.
Senate action
After initially bucking the committee recommendation and supporting legislation (LD 115) to assess impact fees on megayachts over 150 feet long, the Senate reconsidered the measure and ultimately voted 16-19 against passage. During debate, bill sponsor Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) said he didn’t think of the proposal as a tax but rather “a user fee that is being assessed for the potential damage that these mega yachts have inflicted upon our coastlines.”
After initially rejecting LD 893, senators voted to reconsider the bill and backed it. The proposal would exempt statewide nonprofit agricultural membership organizations that provide health care benefits and that meet certain requirements from the definition of “health insurance” under the Maine Insurance Code. According to proponents, this would provide a more affordable health care option for farmers.
Senators voted to pass LD 3, which would require Maine to adopt eastern daylight time year-round if approved by the federal government and also adopted by other states in the eastern time zone. Another bill (LD 4) that would outright establish year-round eastern daylight time for the state was tabled by the chamber.
Senators voted 10-25 to reject the committee recommendation against LD 681, and instead passed the proposal to gradually increase the percentage of the state appropriation for Maine Maritime Academy until it reaches relative parity with the University of Maine and the Maine Community College systems. Bill sponsor Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said that although the state only provides 23% of funding for the school, it is “the highest return on investment for low income students among all public four year institutions.”
House action
Despite passionate debate, the House narrowly rejected (70-66 vote) legislation (LD 331) directing the Department of Health and Human Services to amend its rules to require the department to reimburse hospitals at least 75% of filed MaineCare costs within 90 days of receipt. Numerous lawmakers talked about rural hospital closures and proponents of the measure emphasized that the bill is about ensuring the state reimburses hospitals on time. 
Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot) said the bill, which relies on existing resources, isn’t feasible and if lawmakers want to ensure hospitals get paid, they should have supported the failed supplemental budget proposal that would have made MaineCare funding immediately available for Medicaid providers like hospitals. The bill was then tabled in the Senate.
House lawmakers bucked the committee recommendation and voted against legislation (LD 339) that would pilot a Wabanaki-centered curriculum for Wabanaki children attending public schools. (Read more about the proposal here). 
A bill (LD 818) that would let a candidate use Clean Election Act funding to pay for the care of their dependents narrowly passed the House, with a 67-66 vote. It was tabled in the Senate.
The House narrowly rejected a bill (LD 1255) that would have limited free community college to students who meet the voting residency requirements and that resided in Maine for at least one year prior to enrollment. While proponents expressed concern Maine taxpayers were paying for out-of-staters to go to college for free, critics highlighted that the Maine Community College System has said it’s important to bring workers to the state.
House lawmakers voted 77-68 to reject legislation (LD 1881) that would mandate that parents are entitled to access all information regarding the school activities of their child, including reviewing available school services, teaching and instructional materials, and the child’s health care and education records, with the ability to refuse the child’s participation in any assignment or activity.
House lawmakers voted 93-51 in favor of a constitutional amendment (LD 820) to establish the right to hunt and fish. For it to pass, the bill will need the support of two-thirds of the Legislature. (More on this proposal here).

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Memorial Day 2025 kicked off what the Iowa State Patrol calls the “100 deadliest days of summer,” a period of time marked by an increase in teen driver crashes and fatalities. 
This time of year, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, is when many younger drivers are hitting the roads for the first time and others may be indulging in the holiday season.  Law enforcement agencies, including the Iowa State Patrol, increased their presence on the roadways over the holiday weekend and noticed a continued pattern of decreasing fatal crashes over the past three years.
“Our focus is to make the roadways a safe and enjoyable experience,” said Sgt. Alex Dinkla, public information officer for Iowa State Patrol. “This is one of those periods where that extra enforcement, we know, did pay off.” 
The state patrol arrested 21 individuals for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and covered over 47 crashes across the state. The Iowa Department of Transportation reported two fatal accidents in the days leading up to Memorial Day. 










Buckle that seatbelt, put the phone down and always remember, if you’re gonna go out and have some alcohol, to get that sober driver.


– Sgt. Alex Dinkla, public information officer for Iowa State Patrol


Many of the crashes occurred at intersections around the state. Dinkla noted that drivers often forget the blind spot on both sides of their car, between their windshield and door window. These blind spots can obscure entire vehicles from the driver’s view. Dinkla recommends drivers check two or three times before crossing an intersection to ensure they spot any threats.
In 2023, the DOT reported four fatal crashes in the days before the holiday, one of which was attributed to alcohol. In 2024, there were three fatal crashes. This year, the number dropped to two. Dinkla said that while the patrol doesn’t “want to call that a success because that’s still two fatalities,” it’s evident the extra presence and effort to educate the public is making a difference.
Going forward, Dinkla said, the ISP plans to utilize their Air Wing Unit, a unit of five pilots and aircrafts primarily used for traffic enforcement, more during other holidays and times of peak travel. Founded in 1956, the unit currently consists of three Cessna 182 aircraft, one Cessna 206 and one SR-22 CIRUSS. Two of the aircraft have thermal imaging equipment to aid in missing-person cases, fugitive location and specialized surveillance. 
“None of us know when we may or may not be involved in a fatal crash,” he said. “Buckle that seatbelt, put the phone down and always remember, if you’re gonna go out and have some alcohol, to get that sober driver.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/state-patrol-car-2.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

Gorman Foundation.(Photo by Getty Images)As the state continues to grapple with its record of not providing adequate behavioral health support for young people, a proposal to make funds available for schools to hire licensed behavioral and mental health experts has received initial backing from the Maine Legislature.
The Maine House of Representatives passed LD 858 on Wednesday with 79 members voting in favor and 68 opposed. The Senate passed it without a roll call vote. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach), will go back to both chambers for final enactment votes.
The bill establishes a program within the Maine Department of Education to provide grants to districts that contract licensed professionals for behavioral and mental health services. The funds can only be used to cover those not otherwise covered or reimbursable through MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
Proponents of the bill — including educators, administrators and medical professionals — say the grant program is much needed as Maine educators are not adequately trained to manage worsening student behavior issues, according to a 2025 Maine Education Policy Research Institute report. 
Critics of the proposal said it infringes on a parent’s rights when their child seeks counseling at school, and raised concern about the limited information about what kind of services would be covered under the grants. 
Gramlich said one in six Maine children have been diagnosed with anxiety, and 7% are struggling with depression. Further, 20% of Maine children have experienced two or more Adverse Childhood Experiences — higher than the national average of 17%. ACEs include experiences like violence or abuse, and the stress and trauma that accompanies them can have a lasting negative impact on a child’s wellbeing, according to data from the John T. Gorman Foundation that she cited during the floor discussion Wednesday. 
“Some school districts do offer these types of services in a school-based setting, but the current availability of school-based services is nowhere near adequate. Even when these school-based services are currently available, the funding of these services is so lean and precarious that the future of these programs is constantly in question,” she said, of the proposal that will cost $1.3 million in state funding. 
“These kids need help now. LD 858 would be an important step toward ensuring Maine students have the mental and behavioral health services they need,” she said.
Rep. Sheila Lyman (R-Livermore Falls) raised concern about what she said was a lack of clarity around the scope of services provided. “What specific behavioral and mental health interventions are we funding? Who decides what is appropriate for each child, and how will parents be informed or asked for consent?” she asked. 
“This bill does not sufficiently protect a parent’s right to know and direct the mental and behavioral care their child receives in a school setting,” Lyman said.
The Legislature passed a similar bill last year that died on the special appropriations table, where bills that pass but aren’t otherwise provided for in the state budget compete for remaining funds. Those that are not explicitly funded by the budget committee ultimately die.
Maine has a record of not providing adequate youth mental health support. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state under the Americans with Disabilities Act for unnecessarily segregating children with behavioral health needs and failing to ensure they could thrive in a community-based setting. The state settled last November, with Gov. Janet Mills saying her administration and the Legislature will continue to invest in mental and behavioral health resources. 
“We all strongly agree that in-community behavioral health services are critical, and we are committed to continuing to strengthen the delivery of those services for Maine children who need them,” Mills said in a statement at the time. While the settlement agreement required Maine to expand the availability of community-based behavioral health services for children, it did not specifically add any of these services to schools.
The bill, if funded, “would provide Maine school-aged children with support they need by meeting them where they are most often, and that is their school,” Gramlich said.

For a few minutes on Friday, Gov. Josh Stein joined them.
North Carolina’s Department for Motor Vehicles is facing a months-long backlog of appointments — with a typically busy summer season ramped up further by demand for REAL I.D. Stein has tapped a new commissioner for the department, who’s outlining both a series of quicker fixes and a longer-term “overhaul.” He and top transportation officials visited one of the offices as they delivered remarks on the plans.
“Know that we’re working,” said Paul Tine, who was named DMV commissioner at the end of April. “Know that these folks have not been empowered in the way that they need to, and that’s my job to do that.”

Tine’s first order of business, he says, is improving working conditions and morale in the understaffed offices. The department is moving to increase pay for examiners. They’re beginning to upgrade some long-outdated equipment, and issue new uniforms “for the first time in five years.” And they’re shuffling employees around to reinforce frontline desks — assigning both volunteering central staff and summer interns into high-demand offices.
Motorists visiting DMV offices in the coming months can also expect to see some changes, Tine said. Staff are beginning to “triage” walk-in customers — meeting them as they walk up and making sure they have correct documents so they don’t waste time in line. Four additional offices, and 20 total, are now open for some hours on Saturdays.
And the DMV has been aiming to streamline its website, making it easier to navigate options and clearly identify if you need a REAL I.D. — and if so, what documents you need to bring.
Tine says a longer-term strategic plan to transform the department is in the works. But part of that plan depends on the General Assembly — and whether lawmakers choose to invest more money into hiring additional examiners and bolstering DMV resources.
House Republicans’ proposed budget largely follows the governor’s lead, allocating money to fund dozens of new examiner positions. That budget also green-lights efforts to modernize the DMV’s technology and proposes a study to determine whether the DMV could be privatized.
The Senate budget does not include such additions, with Senate leader Phil Berger expressing skepticism that the department deserves more tax dollars. State Auditor Dave Boliek’s office is currently conducting an audit of the department, with results expected in the coming months.
Tine, who currently owns Midgett Insurance Agency, is a former state representative. He was elected as a Democrat but left the party later, calling himself an independent and choosing to caucus with Republicans. He co-chaired the transportation appropriations committee while in the General Assembly.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1908-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 15:17:46.191207

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)University of Florida President-elect Santa Ono could receive $3 million per year if the State University System’s Board of Governors confirms him next week. 
The proposed contract between UF and Ono includes a $1.5 million base salary for serving as president, $500,000 for serving as UF Health chair, more than $400,000 in annual performance bonuses, and another half-a-million in retirement contributions and retention payments. 
Despite unanimous approval by UF trustees, Ono’s presidency is being protested by some Republicans, while Gov. Ron DeSantis says he is leaving it up to the board he appointed to make the right decision. 
Tuesday, the 17-member Board of Governors will vote on Ono, who received unanimous approval from UF trustees this week. He is the sole finalist for the position. 
“I appointed all those folks, so they’ll make the judgement,” DeSantis said of the Board of Governors’ final vote. 
Former Gov. Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Greg Steube, and U.S. Rep. and GOP gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds have publicly questioned Ono’s candidacy, as has Donald Trump Jr., who took to X to express his feelings on the candidate. 
“WTF! Have the decision makers at @UF lost their minds!??? This woke psycho might be a perfect fit for a Communist school in California, but how is he even being considered for this role in Florida?” Trump Jr. posted Wednesday. “Every single member of the Florida Board of Governors should vote against him!!!”

Ono supported diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in his previous job as president of the University of Michigan, guiding its “DEI 2.0” initiative and touting benefits of such programs but ultimately closed DEI offices earlier this year. Some Republicans question the legitimacy of Ono’s new-found anti-DEI convictions. 
“Now people have pointed out a lot of statements that he has made that are not exactly what we’re looking for in a state where woke goes to die and I cringe at some of these statements,” DeSantis said Thursday, during a news conference in Fort Myers about medical negligence. 
“But basically, I think the folks that were involved in the search, after having interviewed him, spent time with him, it’s their judgement that he’s really kind of reached the limit on the campus leftism and he would want to leave Michigan where that’s prevalent to Florida where it’s frowned upon,” DeSantis said. 
Ono told trustees this week that he developed his new stance on DEI in the last year and a half after talking with students and other members of the university community. Before, he wasn’t an expert on the topic, which had been universal in higher education, he said. 
Florida Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration have focused heavily on removing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from higher education, including banning state expenditures on such initiatives.
“He will lose his job” if he promotes “a fountain of activism or leftist indoctrination,” DeSantis said.

WILMINGTON — Mayor John Carney has signed the City of Wilmington’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget ordinance, finalizing a spending plan that channels significant funding toward public safety, affordable housing, and neighborhood development. 
READ: Wilmington Council approves budget despite concerns over spending, utility costs
The budget includes targeted investments in several priority areas:

Affordable Housing: $2 million in capital funds will go toward building and rehabilitating housing units.
Neighborhood Development: A $2.5 million allocation will support the Neighborhood Stabilization Fund, including $500,000 for the Wilmington Neighborhood Conservancy Land Bank. The rest will fund home repair programs, alleyway cleanups, and tree removal efforts, with a focus on engaging minority contractors.
Support for Small and Minority-Owned Businesses: An additional $350,000 will be added to the Economic Development Strategic Fund.
Public Safety: The city will invest $4 million to launch a municipally operated ambulance service and support evidence-based policing practices.
Infrastructure: Capital funds will support street and sidewalk repairs, stormwater system upgrades, and park improvements.
Senior Tax Relief: The budget expands the city’s property tax exemption for residents age 65 and older living at or below the federal poverty level.


“This budget is about putting our values into action,” Carney said. “We’re building a stronger, safer, and more inclusive Wilmington—one that delivers for every resident.”
At the signing, Carney said the budget reflects shared priorities and invests in the areas that matter to residents. 
“We’re focusing on neighborhood revitalization, public safety, and essential services, while keeping taxes stable and supporting seniors,” he said. “Together, we’re building a Wilmington that works for everyone.”
Councilwoman Michelle Harlee, who chairs the Finance Committee, praised the collaborative process between Council and the administration.
“I’m excited for a number of reasons over this particular budget,” Harlee said. “It is a very much shared vision between the mayor, the administration, and the members of City Council. I’m very, very excited about the investments that are going to take place in our communities and around the city of Wilmington.”

Ellison explained the turnabout in a filing in which he said the arrested people had been found in an area his office thought was part of the new National Defense Area. It wasn’t. As a result, three people arrested in recent weeks won’t face newly created criminal charges for trespassing on a military base, punishable by up to a year in jail.
The dropped charges point to the ongoing confusion the new 400-square-mile military zone has created across branches of government and the courts since the U.S. Interior Department transferred the land to the Army in April.
“It is concerning that even the Acting United States Attorney is confused by the boundaries of this new National Defense Area,” a spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) said in an emailed statement Thursday after Source New Mexico alerted his office to the dismissals. Heinrich has criticized the new NDA and called on the Defense Department to explain what it means for recreators and others.
On April 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the transfer of land from the Bureau of Land Management to the military, effectively making the 180-mile border New Mexico shares with Mexico into an extended military base tied to Fort Huachuca in Arizona. 
Along with increasing Army patrols and empowering the “military [to] take a more direct role in securing our southern border,” as President Donald Trump said, creating the zone also enabled federal prosecutors to impose misdemeanor charges on those caught in the new National Defense Area. 
Confusion about where that area falls exists not just among federal agencies tasked with enforcing the NDA, but also among residents who live, work and attend school along the border, including ranchers with BLM cattle leases and dual citizens who cross the border daily.
Source NM spent the weekend in the area and talked with residents who described whiplash from a transfer, seemingly overnight, of federal public lands into an extended military base.
The land includes parcels of private property surrounded by federal lands; the Diocese of El Paso, which owns nearby pilgrimage site Mount Cristo Rey; and the State of New Mexico, which has miles of trust land.

The land also traverses the Continental Divide Trail, and hosts both hikers on multi-state sojourns and hunters hoping to nab a rare Mearns quail, among heartier fare that hide among the creosote dotting the borderlands separating New Mexico from Mexico. 
Recently, the Defense Department issued a statement telling hikers and hunters they were prohibited from entering the NDA. That incensed Angel Peña, director of Nuestra Tierra Conservation Project, a Las Cruces-based nonprofit that tries to help marginalized communities experience and conserve public lands. 
“You’re really now affecting livelihoods,” Peña told Source New Mexico during a drive Memorial Day Weekend along the northern edge of the NDA. “You’re affecting dinner on the table. You’re affecting recreation. You’re affecting the traditional uses of this land that help families make memories and tell stories and grow ever closer.”
No man’s land 
Between April 15 and May 29, the federal government charged more than 550 people with unauthorized entry into the new National Defense Area, according to a review of federal records. 
Federal prosecutors dropped charges for three of them based on the errant arrests dropped May 22, per Ellison’s filings. According to court records, Ellison’s office learned “on or about May 15” that portions of the border area “previously understood as encompassed” by the newly created New Mexico National Defense Area “were not, in fact, transferred to the jurisdiction of the Army.”
The dismissed cases come amid ongoing legal challenges, with federal public defenders contesting the charges on a variety of fronts. Two weeks ago, a federal judge dismissed more than 100 charges against the defendants, largely because he was not convinced those arrested knew they were entering a restricted area. 
The circumstances of the recent dismissals regarding errant arrests are not clear. AUSA spokesperson Tessa Duberry declined to comment on where the defendants were arrested, saying the office can’t comment beyond what was filed publicly. 
She also declined to say how many total cases the office has dismissed on those grounds or would dismiss, saying compiling that information would impose a “significant burden” on staff.
Duberry referred comment about arrests to the Army, which told Source in a statement Friday morning that it would not speculate on charges that are awaiting adjudication,” said Joint Task Force Southern Border spokesperson Jordan Beagle. Beagle also noted that only the Border Patrol makes arrests, though the Army will temporarily detain people to hand over to the Border Patrol.

“The Joint Task Force Southern Border remains laser focused on our mission to achieve 100% operational control of the border, in this case maintaining security within the National Defense Areas,” he said, “which includes detection, temporary detainment, and apprehension of those who trespass within the National Defense Areas.”
The Border Patrol did not respond to a request for comment from Source on Thursday. 
According to court filings, two of the three people feds dropped charges againt were arrested April 26 about “four miles east of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.” Outside of the 60-foot buffer zone along the border, that’s roughly a mile from Mount Cristo Rey and other privately owned land. Source’s calls to the Diocese this week were not returned.
The third arrest occurred April 27, according to court filings, “about eight miles west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.” 
Federal judge dismisses trespass charges against migrants caught in NM military zone

All three criminal complaints note, as part of the justification for charges, that signs were posted in English and Spanish that “this is a restricted area and that unauthorized entry is prohibited.”
The impact of those dismissals on prosecutors’ cases remains unclear. Even though prosecutors dismissed the trio’s charges for unauthorized NDA entry, each appears to still be held in detention on related misdemeanors, including charges like “illegal entry by an alien” into the United States, “illegal entry without inspection” or entering military property, according to court records. 
Amanda Skinner, assistant federal public defender, declined to comment on how many of her office’s clients might have been affected by the dismissals, or whether she is expecting there to be any more. 
Heinrich, through his spokesperson, said he remains concerned about what the military takeover of the New Mexico border will mean for due process, for citizens and non-citizens alike. 
“The Trump Administration is bypassing due process for individuals who either intentionally or unintentionally enter this newly restricted area, including U.S. citizens who may be stopped and detained by U.S. Army soldiers for trespassing on an unmarked military base,” his spokesperson said. 
Back at the ranch
One group affected by the NDA — ranchers — has apparently reached a slightly uneasy, informal arrangement with the Army, according to ranchers along the border and the New Mexico Cattlegrowers Association.
In the last two weeks, Army and Border Patrol officials have collected the names, photographs, phone numbers, license plates and other details of ranchers who enter the NDA to round up their livestock or check on water tanks, ranchers told Source New Mexico. 
The collection is an effort, they said, to make sure  the Army does not mistake ranchers, who often carry firearms, for those who might be trespassing on a military base.

“Everybody around here in this part of the country is armed,” said Nancy Clopton, a longtime Hachita rancher with 80 square miles of leased pasture in and around the NDA. “I don’t want to be drug out of my pickup and then, you know, ‘Oh, she’s armed.’”
The agreement allows ranchers to drive along access roads and county roads criss-crossing the NDA. Each time, they drive over cattleguards with new signs on either side that begin with, in English and Spanish: “Restricted Area: This Department of Defense Property has been declared a restricted area by authority of the commander.” 
About a dozen such signs are posted on cattleguards off Highway 9 between Sunland Park and Hachita, according to Source’s count Sunday. Those are the same signs prosecutors use to justify criminal charges against the 550 defendants facing the unauthorized entry charges so far. 










Everybody around here in this part of the country is armed. I don't want to be drug out of my pickup and then, you know, ‘Oh, she's armed.’


– Rancher Nancy Clopton


In response to questions from Source, Luis Soriano, Heinrich’s spokesperson, noted that Ellison and Hegseth have both publicly said there will be “no exceptions” for criminal trespassing in the area, and so Heinrich doesn’t consider an “informal, handshake deal sufficient to ensure the safety” of ranchers, sportsmen, hikers or others.
“For decades, ranchers and hunters alike have been accustomed to carrying firearms on what were their public lands until the transfer to the Department of Defense on April 15th,” Soriano said in a statement. “That history, combined with the complete lack of clarity from the Administration, is a recipe for a very dangerous situation for our local residents, Army soldiers and Border Patrol agents.”
Beagle, with the Army, told Source in a statement to Friday that the army is continuing to work on a formal “memorandum of understanding” with various groups to “support the interests of the local community and the military mission within the New Mexico National Defense Area (NDA).”

“The MOU process for commercial and recreational activities, such as hunting, mining, and ranching, is complex,” he said “and necessitates careful coordination with multiple organizations to ensure that proposed activities do not compromise public safety and border security operations.”
Beagle also said the Army would release more information to the community as it becomes available. He also noted the land order that enabled the transfer was “subject to valid existing rights,” so he said the private “property owners” with land adjacent to the NDA would not be affected. But he did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how that applies to ranchers who lease, not own, land in the area. 
Bronson Corn, president of the NM Cattlegrowers Association, defended the arrangement in an interview with Source on Thursday. 
He disagrees with the idea that ranchers might be skirting the law, saying, albeit informal, the agreement allows ranchers to keep their cattle alive and maintain their leases with the BLM, while also allowing the Army to harden the border. 
“They have not had any conflicts with the military when it comes to being able to continue on with their day-to-day operations,” he said. “There is some concern, there’s no doubt about it, that they can’t get to certain areas of their ranch due to the fact of that militarized zone.”
In addition to concerns about firearms, Clopton said she is concerned an influx of army personnel, potentially from out-of-state, won’t be careful to close cattle gates behind them, which is a long-standing gripe she and other ranchers have with the Border Patrol. But she is withholding judgment, for now. 
“We’ll see how it works out,” she said. “It depends on the individuals on the ground, those individual soldiers, how they treat us, how we see them. It’s an experiment.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Labor confirmed Thursday that 34 Mine Safety and Health Adminsitration offices will be retained. They said the agency “has been working closely with [the General Services Administration] to ensure our MSHA inspectors have the resources they need to carry out their core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthy workplaces for American miners.”
The reversal comes amid a push back from the Black Lung Association, the United Mine Workers of America, and others on what advocates called the Trump administration’s “attacks on coal miner safety.” In April, workers at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety were put on administrative leave due to “reorganizations” at the federal level. 
According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the MSHA offices that were slated to close performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered workers from NIOSH’s Respiratory Health Division back to work, ending a reduction in force that prevented coal miners with black lung disease from having the option to transfer to less dusty areas of the mine to prevent further illness and injury.
MSHA had delayed the implementation of a new silica rule aimed at protecting coal miners from the dust that causes black lung disease. The rule was set to be effective in April but will now be effective in August. 
“I’m happy they’re going to keep these MSHA offices open,” Gary Hairston, president of the National Black Lung Association, said in a news release. “We need these offices that are close to the mines so that MSHA can conduct safety inspections and respond to accidents in a timely way. Now we need MSHA to enforce the new silica rule, and we need Congress to give MSHA enough funding to do its job.”
In a statement Friday, the United Mine Workers of America, a labor union representing coal miners, said the organization is relieved by the decision but called on the Department of Labor to be transparent about which offices remain are still at risk, and to stop remaining efforts to reduce the government’s mine safety infrastructure.
“The idea that anyone would even consider shuttering dozens of MSHA field offices, most of which are located in remote mining communities, shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to keep miners safe,” UMWA International President Cecil E. Roberts said in the statement. “We’ve said from day one that cutting these offices would compromise inspectors’ ability to respond quickly to accidents, enforce safety regulations, and protect the lives of our members and their coworkers.”
In a statement Friday, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, and chair of the Senate Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, said she was glad to hear that many of West Virginia’s MSHA offices will remain open. 
“I have raised this issue directly with [Department of Labor] Secretary [Lori] Chavez-DeRemer because I was concerned about the impact these closures could have on mine safety and workers’ access to support,” Capito said. “Keeping these offices open is the right decision — and a win for miners, inspectors, and the communities they serve.”

DemasEnbridge Energy’s controversial Line 5 tunnel project will move forward to a 30-day public comment period after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday released a draft environmental impact statement, which did not clear the project of all and potentially significant environmental concerns raised by activists and lawmakers opposed to the pipeline and its proposed tunnel.
The proposed plan is to construct a 3.6 mile tunnel under the lakebed of the Straits of Mackinac that would house a replacement segment of Line 5. The pipeline consists of two 20-inch diameter pipes that are buried in sediment near the shore and rest on, or are anchored to, the lakebed of the Stratis, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said.
Enbridge’s aim is to have that tunnel approved for permitting by the federal government through the Army Corp’s review process. It is their preferred alternative to no action from the Corps, which the company has said could result in less environmental security and certainty. Other alternatives include bolstering the tunnel with protective materials or the decommissioning of the pipeline altogether, which is what Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel set out to do shortly after they entered office in 2018.
Enbridge called the release of the impact statement and opening the public comment period a significant milestone for the project.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It is the result of more than five years of rigorous and comprehensive permit review and stakeholder engagement including input from Tribes and is a critical step forward in planning a project that will modernize energy infrastructure, protect the Great Lakes, and ensure long-term energy reliability for Michigan and the broader region,” said Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy. “We appreciate the extensive technical work that went into this document and the opportunity to contribute detailed responses to numerous data and information requests – demonstrating our commitment to transparency and environmental, social and cultural responsibility.”
Duffy added that it was Enbridge’s goal for the proposed tunnel and the existing line to have “the smallest possible environmental footprint.”
“The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the [impact statement] to further refine the project,” he said.











Some activists who have fought against the continued operation of the line said this week that more work was needed to prevent the project from moving forward, while others said were disappointed in the state’s efforts to shut down Line 5.











Andrea Pierce, founder of the Michigan Anishinaabek caucus and policy director at the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, said Michigan needed to have good, clean, safe water for them to drink, to fish, to hunt, to gather. Those were also the hallmarks of the treaty rights granted to Tribes in Michigan.
Pierce was critical of Whitmer’s actions thus far.
“Governor Whitmer has done some things. She has [attempted to] shut them down. She revoked their easement. But that’s it,” Pierce said. “What else is being done? It’s operating illegally. That pipeline for years now [has been] operating illegally. They’re still making a profit off of us, off of Michigan citizens. They are making a profit, these Canadian companies, that needs to stop.”
Enbridge initially filed to apply for permits to build the tunnel in April 2020. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been working on the draft economic statement since then. In April, the Corps said its evaluation would move forward on a shortened timeline following an executive order from President Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, the existence of Line 5 and its continued operation has been fought out in a winding legal battle that remains active even as the project hit a milestone of forward progress on Friday.
Public comment on the project will end on June 30. Virtual public meetings are scheduled for June 18 and June 25, and comments will be collected online or through written submissions, which can be mailed to 6501 Shady Grove Road, P.O. Box 10178, Gaithersburg, MD 20898.
The impact statement released Friday factored in many rounds of previous public comment and input from Tribal organizations, as well as analysis of the project plans and potential alternatives.
The upshot: Enbridge’s tunnel project could have numerous consequences for land ownership and land use, land and water-based recreation, water resources, area aesthetics and air quality, as well as biological, cultural and soil resources.
As to the cultural resources affected, construction and operation of the tunnel would have adverse effects on archaeological sites and an existing archaeological district. Each of the activities associated with construction were listed as events that would destroy archaeological resources within the project footprint.
Impacts to Tribal treaty rights were not noted in the report, but the Corps said those issues would be determined in its decision materials following the new round of public comment.
A change of land ownership might be necessary at certain laydown areas as Enbridge would have to purchase land within the sites or acquire temporary or permanent easements. 
Direct, long-term and permanent detrimental impacts were associated with the project, the Corps said, as it related to undeveloped forest land that would need to be transformed into industrial sites, permanently altering the geology along the proposed tunnel site.
Direct and detrimental effects to nearby recreational sites were noted due to the noise and aesthetic impacts of construction. Those impacts would likely end when construction was completed, however.
Groundwater could be affected, but aquifer testing along the tunnel alignment site showed the surrounding aquifer would recover in a matter of days following construction. There is, however, concern for the potential release of drilling fluids and other contaminants associated with onshore material storage and the use of heavy equipment.
That said, the Corps noted that those impacts would also end once construction ceased – but with a heavy caveat that the construction contractor would have to adhere to a spill plan and monitor onsite and nearby well water for up to two years following completion.
To that end, surface water could be greatly affected by the project, as it would disturb the Straits during the installation of a water intake pipe. Approximately 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid – consisting of water and bentonite – would be released. The features would be removed following construction.

The turbidity and sedimentation in the area would be affected on a limited basis in the work area, but direct and detrimental impacts were noted to surface water adjacent to the construction site due to erosion and sedimentation.
An adherence to mitigation measures as a part of any approved permits would alleviate some of those concerns, and any long-term increases in stormwater would be managed by a permanent stormwater system.
Again, the Corps noted detrimental impacts associated with the unintended release of contaminants like equipment fuel.
Vegetation and wildlife disturbances in the area were also listed as factors, the latter of which would come from blasting activities during site preparation and the presence of workers in wildlife areas. The loss of approximately eight acres of habitat for protected species was noted, which would require ongoing coordination with the federal government and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
Air quality would also be disturbed during construction, and proposed ventilation fans would add to noise nuisance, but only on an intermittent basis. The possibility of harmful emissions were noted to be significantly higher with Enbridge’s proposed version of the tunnel project compared to an alternative that includes a gravel and protective rock cover.
The reliability of the tunnel and its safety assurances were also analyzed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but the report noted that the possibility of a catastrophic anchor strike, which could potentially release oil into the Great Lakes, would be eliminated with the presence of a tunnel.
Decommissioning the line also carried some potential localized and short-term consequences, the Army Corps said.
Reactions to the project’s forward progress were mixed, at best.
Great Lakes Michigan Jobs – a business coalition composed of the Detroit Regional Chamber, the Grand Rapids Chamber, economic development organization InvestUP and the Upper Peninsula Construction Council – said in a joint statement issued Friday that they were ready to support the tunnel project as the public comment period commenced.
The group also said that it was time to grant the project its permits to build the tunnel.
“Line 5 is an important piece of energy infrastructure for the continent, providing Michiganders with critical light crude and propane extracted from Canada,” Brian Shoaf, vice president of Public Policy and Business Advocacy with the Detroit Regional Chamber, said in a statement. 
Josh Lunger, vice president of government affairs with the Grand Rapids Chamber, said the tunnel wasn’t just an energy project, it was a strategic infrastructure investment.
“Across the entire state, we count on Line 5. It powers our businesses, our job sites, and even our homes,” Lunger said in a statement. “The Army Corps has been reviewing permit applications for more than five years. It’s time to grant the permits.”

Those who have been opposed to the project have said for years that the pipeline is a danger to the Great Lakes and the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel project, in their view, would not alleviate the environmental concerns, but only stands to exacerbate them.
As lawmakers and business leaders met for the Detroit Regional Chamber Mackinac Policy Conference this week on Mackinac Island, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who gave a speech to the conference Thursday night, so too did activists gather to express concerns over Line 5.
Ahead of the governor’s annual speech, protesters marched through downtown Mackinac Island, where they planned to rally outside the Grand Hotel for a press conference denouncing the tunnel project. 
The protesters, however, were turned away at the bottom of the hill approaching the hotel by a person who said he was there on behalf of the hotel. The man informed the protesters that the sidewalks and roads leading to the hill were private property owned by the Grand Hotel. 
That did not deter the protesters from being heard, even as they were diverted away from the hotel.
“Governor Whitmer has stood up for the Great Lakes and all of us before, by revoking Line 5’s illegal easement, but her work isn’t done,” said Beth Wallace, the Great Lakes climate and energy director at the National Wildlife Federation. “Now, Enbridge wants to blast and drill through the Great Lakes for years just to extend [the] life of a pipeline that will soon reach 80 years old and has already spilled at least 35 times. Meanwhile, the Great Lakes business network and regional experts confirm the project is absolutely not needed,”
Wallace added that decommissioning Line 5 was “the only honorable path forward, and means we’re honoring treaties and public trust, supporting domestic energy supplies and alternatives, creating more jobs in decommissioning, avoiding noticeable price increases, and it’s important to notice we are paying for the tunnel.”
“Those price increases are going to happen in the rates that Enbridge is already setting,” Wallace said. “The proposed tunnel isn’t about safety or providing our communities with energy, it’s about Enbridge’s profits.”

Shattuck said the workers had finished work for the day Thursday and had left the construction site when the arrests took place nearby. READ MORE
As of Friday morning, the individuals were being held at Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, according to a Friday press release from the Burlington-based migrant advocacy group the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. “Five or so” of the individuals were carrying proof of their immigration status at the time of the incident and are being scheduled for release, the press release stated. The immigration status of the other detainees was not immediately clear. ICE did not immediately respond to VTDigger’s requests for comment. The episode marks the second mass-detainment incident in Vermont in as many months as federal immigration officials ramp up enforcement efforts across the country to carry out the policies of President Donald Trump. Last month, eight migrant workers were detained at a dairy farm in Berkshire after Customs and Border Protection agents responded to a call alleging that suspicious looking men had crossed onto the farm property. Four of those arrested have already been deported to Mexico, while others remain in ICE custody.The arrests correspond with what advocacy groups have said is an alarming increase of ICE’s use of commercial flights to transfer detainees out of the state. On Friday, in the latest such incident, ICE transferred seven women on a United Airlines flight from Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport to Chicago, according to the release from the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. The women, who had been detained at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, were observed on the flight among commercial passengers with a plainclothes federal escort, the release stated. Legal observers awaiting the arrival of the flight said the ICE detainees did not get off the plane in Chicago and the plane subsequently reboarded for a flight to Washington, D.C., according to the release.Former state Rep. Kiah Morris, who was apparently on the same flight, posted a video to social media in which she drew attention to the incident. “I have great concerns about the fact that this is happening and not certain on what we should be able to do as a public to really be able to really help support folks right now,” Morris said in the video. “(These are) some terrifying things to see happening right in front of our faces.”This story will be updatedRead the story on VTDigger here:  Immigration officials detain 10 construction workers in Newport.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP17044803991198-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-30 14:14:39.009948

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado immigrant rights advocates expressed outrage over the Thursday arrest of a family of three outside a federal immigration court in Denver, calling the tactic an escalation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that will punish immigrants who comply with the law by attending their scheduled court hearings.
Emily Brock, an attorney with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, witnessed the arrest of the family, including a 1-year-old child, shortly after they attended their hearing at the Department of Justice’s Denver Immigration Court at 1961 Stout St. Six unidentified plainclothes officers surrounded the family, according to the Colorado Rapid Response Network, a coalition of immigrant advocacy groups. The officers refused to let Brock speak with the family about their rights before they were taken away.
“As a parent, I cannot imagine the terror these parents experienced as the officers surrounded them with their child in their arms and told them they were to go with them,” she said.

“As the officers got closer, the little boy’s arms clung tighter around his father’s neck,” Brock added. “To take enforcement action against a family following the rules, attending their proceedings, is an attack on due process and serves only to instigate increased levels of fear in the community.”
The arrest at a federal courthouse in Denver appears to be part of a nationwide policy shift by ICE as President Donald Trump’s administration moves to carry out unprecedented mass deportations of as many as 12 million immigrants in the U.S. who lack permanent legal status. Federal immigration agents have long avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings.
But over the last week, an “aggressive new initiative” by ICE has abruptly reversed that policy, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times.
Christina Brown, an immigration attorney and founder of the Colorado Asylum Center, said that such a policy will force immigrant families to make an “impossible choice” — whether to “attend court and face possible arbitrary mandatory months-long detention, family separation and the prospect of arguing your case from inside detention, or not appear in court and face certain targeting for deportation by ICE.”
Denver’s ICE field office did not immediately respond to questions Friday about the arrest and where the family was being held. Colorado’s only immigrant detention center, in Aurora, is an adults-only facility. Under Trump, multiple ICE facilities across the country have been reopened for family detention, a practice that had largely ended under former President Joe Biden.
“Detaining an entire family — including a baby — after they did exactly what was asked of them shows how far ICE will go to punish people simply for trying to stay together and follow the law,” said Raquel Lane-Arellano, communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. “This is a deliberate attempt to scare our communities out of the courtroom and into the shadows. But we won’t back down — we will keep showing up for each other, demanding justice, and holding those in power accountable.”

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Thursday released a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions” it says “are deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities. Sanctuary cities protect dangerous criminal aliens from facing consequences and put law enforcement in peril.”
DHS includes 23 of New Mexico’s 33 counties on its list, along with the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
The list follows President Donald Trump’s executive order in April requiring such a list. Following that executive order, City of Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber told Source the City of Santa Fe does not specifically identify itself as a sanctuary city and he did not think the order applied to the city. The City of Santa Fe passed a resolution in 1999, which was reaffirmed in 2017, declaring itself a welcoming city for immigrants and refugees.
“We treat everyone in our city the same: with respect and a welcoming attitude, regardless of a variety of factors including whether they’re here with documentation,” Webber said. “That continues to be our city policy.”
In a written statement provided to Source last month, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller last month emphasized that Trump’s executive order is counterproductive to addressing crime.”We remember when Trump tried to extort immigrant-friendly cities like ours before, but threatening to defund the police is the exact opposite of what Albuquerque needs to be safe,” Keller said. “Our communities are stronger when people of all backgrounds feel safe reporting crimes and working with police, and our officers will keep arresting anyone who breaks the law, regardless of their immigration status.”
Trump orders list of ‘sanctuary cities’ to target for funding freeze

“Each jurisdiction listed will receive formal notification of its non-compliance with Federal statutes,” the DHS stated in posting the list. “DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens.”
In response to the list, leaders from several civil rights and immigration organizations issued statements decrying its publication.
“New Mexico has a proud tradition of welcoming immigrants,” Lena Weber, interim policy director with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, said in a statement. “Immigrants and mixed-status families are integral to our communities. We talk a lot about public safety in this state—and we know that we are all safer when our families can go to school, work, and health centers without fear of being torn away from their loved ones.”
Sanctuary studies

Fabiola Landeros from El CENTRO de Igualdad y Derechos said in a statement that, “We are proud of the legacy we’ve built in New Mexico, including the passage of policies that promote public safety, safeguard civil rights, promote immigrant integration, and recognize the vast contributions of our immigrant communities. The Trump administration’s terrifying vision of mass deportation and family separation and their willingness to trample on constitutional rights and utilize illegal tactics is not only against New Mexican values, but it will also have a devastating impact on our communities and economy.”
Jessica Inez Martínez, director of policy and coalition building at New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, described “labeling sanctuary policies as ‘lawless insurrection’ is not only inflammatory—it is legally baseless and a reckless distortion of the rule of law.  At the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, we see every day how immigrant families are building lives rooted in care, resilience, and hope. They are our neighbors, coworkers, and caregivers—essential to the cultural and economic life of New Mexico.”

More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.

The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”

Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”

Keeping talent

For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.

GOP support

During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.

Running the gamut

The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.

Sandwich generation

Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

Joni Ernst held a town hall at Aplington-Parkersburg High School in Parkersburg May 30, 2025. (Screenshot via C-SPAN)PARKERSBURG — At a sometime raucous town hall meeting Friday morning, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst faced vocal opposition on her support for spending cuts to programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.
Like many other Republican lawmakers holding events with constituents throughout the country, Ernst faced a crowd at the Aplington-Parkersburg High School who were upset with decisions made by President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress — particularly as they relate to funding for health care and food assistance programs included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House earlier in May.
Though Ernst said the Senate would make changes to the measure and advance their own version of the legislation, she defended reductions in spending for Medicaid at the town hall, saying the changes will not impact people in need but will remove from the program “illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits” and able-bodied adults who are not working.
“People will die,” a woman shouted at the stage as Ernst answered one of several questions about the cuts.
“People are not — well, we all are going to die, so for heaven’s sake,” Ernst said in a response that was met by further shouts and jeering from the crowd.
Ernst said she agrees with most of the provisions on Medicaid included in the House version of the budget reconciliation bill, saying that it was targeted at changes to the public health care program that “made it much easier to get onto Medicaid, but much tougher to take people off of Medicaid.” Ernst said many people on Medicaid currently are working full-time and have access to other benefits.
“What we have to do is make sure that those that are not eligible by the federal standard for Medicaid are not receiving Medicaid,” Ernst said. “What we do need to do is make sure that those that are part of a vulnerable population have access to Medicaid and receive those full benefits. So what we’re trying to do is strengthen Medicaid by directing the dollars to the people that actually meet the requirements of the program.”
It its House form, the bill includes a $625 billion reduction in federal spending for Medicaid over 10 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. It also includes 80-hour-per-month work requirements for people between ages 19 and 65 to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage, with several exceptions for people with disabilities and complex medical conditions, pregnant people, tribal community members and parents of dependent children.
Elizabeth Kehret, who works for Lutheran Services in Iowa, said she was troubled by the potential impact of Medicaid cuts for pregnant woman, saying that she was previously enrolled on Medicaid during her four pregnancies before the state revuised eligibility for postpartum coverage, changing it from families with incomes of 375% of the federal poverty line to those at 215% of the federal poverty line.
Kehret said she was concerned the federal Medicaid spending cuts would cause similar cuts for care in states across the country, meaning pregnant people, who may also have private health coverage, will struggle to pay for the medical care required both before and after their child is born.
“I heard you say earlier about people who work full time but still get Medicaid — yeah,” Kehret said. “I meet with dozens of women who have dual enrollment, where they have private insurance as well as Medicaid, and it helps cover the things that their private insurance doesn’t, or that high deductible. … Medicaid is extremely important to the smallest and most vulnerable population in Iowa.”
Ernst said there were provisions to allow continued Medicaid coverage for pregnant people in the House bill.
“Because you are part of that vulnerable population, we want to make sure that you have access to Medicaid,” Ernst said. “So you will hear examples of those like the able-bodied, 30-year-old man who is taking advantage of the program, not working. What we’re asking is that please engage in work activities, engage in volunteer activities, be enrolled in a training program, and then that makes you Medicaid eligible.”
Similar concerns were brought up about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, that provides food assistance to low-income individuals. Under the House budget plan, some costs of SNAP would be moved to the states, in addition to adding other work requirements. Ernst said the House bill is correcting “overpayments” from states on SNAP, in addition to removing “people that have not been eligible for these programs by law as it is currently written” from public assistance.
Several veterans also spoke at the event, criticizing Republicans and Elon Musk’s DOGE Service for cuts to veterans’ assistance programs and cuts to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. In response, Ernst said, “We’re not cutting veterans benefits.”
Several veterans have been outspoken about changes made by DOGE to the VA, including the cut of roughly 2,400 VA jobs in early March.
Ernst has been a major supporter of DOGE and efforts to make government more “efficient,” saying Republicans and Musk are focused on removing areas of unnecessary spending and “streamlining” existing programs and services. Ernst highlighted the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as an entity that can be made more efficient through DOGE efforts in response to a question on federal support following natural disasters.
“Department of Government Efficiency … the E is not about elimination, it is about efficiency,” Ernst said. “So how can we do better as a federal government to respond to the people on the ground?”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-30-at-11.27.38 AM-1024x592.png,,,2025-05-30 13:16:33.529064

The suit was filed Thursday in Douglas County District Court. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Two physicians and three women are plaintiffs in a Kansas lawsuit challenging constitutionality of a state law invalidating advance medical directives outlining end-of-life treatment for pregnant patients.
The group’s lawsuit seeks to prohibit enforcement of a Kansas statute interfering with health care decisions outlined in living wills based exclusively on an individual’s pregnancy status. Kansas is among states permitting state interference in advance directives for pregnant patients, regardless of the gestational age of a fetus, when a person was incapacitated or terminally ill.
Issues surrounding end-of-life state law recently took on urgency as a brain-dead pregnant Georgia woman was placed on life support in deference to that state’s abortion ban.
Kansas patient plaintiffs Emma Vernon, Abigail Ottaway and Laura Stratton as well as Kansas physician plaintiffs Michele Bennett and Lynley Holman argued in the Douglas County District Court complaint filed Thursday the Kansas law violated rights of personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment and freedom of speech under the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights by disregarding clearly articulated end-of-life choices of pregnant people.
“Because I’m currently pregnant, I don’t get the peace of mind a living will is meant to provide,” said Vernon, a Lawrence resident who is pregnant. “I shouldn’t have to fear that my pregnancy could cost me my dignity and autonomy.”
Vernon said she outlined in a living will the medical care she would want if faced with a life-threatening condition, but Kansas’ law meant she wouldn’t have control over her end-of-life care while pregnant.
“I am no less capable of planning my medical care simply because I am pregnant. I know what is best for me,” she said.
Many states established a boundary for medical directives of pregnant individuals no longer capable of participating in end-of-life care in terms of the viability of a fetus. Kansas’ statute invalidated decision-making authority of pregnant women regardless of gestational development of a fetus.
Holman, a Lawrence physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, said responsibilities of health care professionals should be centered on honoring patients’ autonomy and privacy.
“When a law compels me to act against my patients’ clearly expressed decisions, it not only undermines the trust at the heart of the patient-provider relationship, but also threatens the ethical foundation of medical care,” Holman said.
Defendants in the Kansas lawsuit are Kris Kobach, the state attorney general; Richard Bradbury, president of the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts; and Dakota Loomis, district attorney in Douglas County. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kobach and Bradbury from enforcing state law nullifying directives of pregnant women.
The case was filed by attorneys with Compassion & Choices, a Colorado nonprofit working to improve patient autonomy at the end of life; If/When/How, a California reproductive rights legal nonprofit; and the Topeka law firm of Irigonegaray & Revenaugh.
Attorney Pedro Irigonegaray said Kansans valued individual rights and personal freedoms, but the state’s pregnancy exclusion “betrays those values by denying pregnant people the right to control their own medical decisions.”
“Our plaintiffs are simply asking for the same fundamental rights the Kansas Constitution guarantees to all Kansans,” said Jess Pezley, senior staff attorney at Compassion & Choices. “Categorically stripping individuals of their right to make deeply personal end-of-life decisions because they are pregnant is not only offensive, it’s fundamentally at odds with the values enshrined in the Kansas Constitution.”
The lawsuit says Kansas law “unjustly, discriminatorily and categorically disregards” the clearly expressed end-of-life decisions of pregnant women.
The women plaintiffs asked the district court to “affirm that the protections guaranteed by the Kansas Constitution apply equally to them and ensure that their most personal end-of-life decisions will be respected regardless of their pregnancy status.”
In addition, the petition says the physician plaintiffs were “deeply committed to the foundational medical principle that patients have a fundamental right to determine what treatment they receive, and that providing treatment without a patient’s informed consent violates both medical ethics and the law.”
“Yet, Kansas law compels them to disregard their patients’ clearly expressed end-of-life decisions, forcing them to provide their pregnant patients with a lower standard of care than any of their other patients receive,” the petition said. “It demands this diminished care without offering any clarity on what end-of-life treatment they are required to provide — leaving them to guess at what the law expects while exposing them to civil, criminal and professional consequences for getting it wrong.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pregnancy-end-of-life-lawsuit-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 13:16:33.529064

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that seeks to control the rising cost of prescription drugs while also offering financial help for many small, independent pharmacies in Illinois cleared the state Senate on Thursday and awaits action in the House.

The bill, known as the Prescription Drug Affordability Act, contained in House Bill 1697, would put new regulations and impose new fees on a large but little understood segment of the prescription drug industry — pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.

“This really restricts the ability of PBMs to extract large amounts of money out of the prescription drug system,” Sen. Dave Koehler, D-Peoria, the bill’s chief Senate sponsor, said in an interview.

PBMs act as a kind of third-party intermediary in the insurance industry who manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of insurance plans. They do that by negotiating prices with drug manufacturers, setting reimbursement rates paid to pharmacies, developing formularies, or “preferred drug lists,” and maintaining pharmacy networks where insured individuals get their prescriptions filled.

But they have also come under criticism in recent years for being too closely integrated with some of the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chains and for helping drive up the cost of prescription drugs, often at the expense of smaller, independent community pharmacies.

“They extract extra profit from patients through opaque and often predatory tactics,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in calling for the legislation during his State of the State address in February. “Not only are they driving up health care costs for Illinois families by hundreds of millions of dollars per year, but they are also putting small, local, independent pharmacies out of business.”

Many large PBMs, such as CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health, also either own or are affiliated with large retail chain pharmacies. Critics of their practices argue they use their position to steer patients to their own pharmacies, often to the detriment of smaller, independent pharmacies. That has resulted in what some people call “pharmacy deserts” in many small towns, rural areas and low-income urban communities.

“PBMs routinely reimburse my pharmacy below cost for brand name prescriptions, medications where they're already pocketing massive rebates from drug manufacturers,” David Bagot, an independent pharmacist from Petersburg who is also president of the Illinois Pharmacists Association, told a Senate committee Wednesday. “Meanwhile, they pay their own affiliated pharmacies – including PBM-owned community, mail-order and specialty pharmacies – much higher rates for the same medications.”

The bill would prohibit PBMs from “steering” insured patients to their own affiliated pharmacies, either by requiring them to use a particular pharmacy or by forcing the patient to pay more for their medications if they use a different outlet.

It would also prohibit the practice of “spread pricing,” or charging an insurance plan one price for a given drug while reimbursing pharmacies at a lower rate for that same drug and pocketing the difference.

In addition, the bill calls for levying a fee on PBMs based on the number of patients they insure. Money from that fee would go into a fund for the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to award up to $25 million a year in grants to independent pharmacies and pharmacies located in rural counties, medically underserved areas, low-income communities and pharmacies that serve high concentrations of Medicaid patients.

It also would require PBMs to remit all the money they receive in the form of rebates from drug manufacturers to the insurance plan sponsors. And it would require them to disclose to state regulators how much they receive in rebates each year.

Pharmaceutical industry lobbyists argued many provisions of the bill, including the fee levied on PBMs, will actually end up being passed on to insurance plans and consumers, thus resulting in higher prescription drug prices.

“This is not a prescription drug affordability bill,” said Lori Reimers, lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association. “Costs will rise. When you give more money to pharmacies, when you restrict tools that lower cost, the cost of insurance and health plans are going to go up on your constituents.”

Reimers noted that since 2016, Illinois lawmakers have enacted 20 new laws pertaining to PBMs including laws granting the state Department of Insurance regulatory powers over PBMs, all with the intent of bringing down drug prices.

“And I don't think anybody's here saying that drug prices have gotten lower yet,” she said. “But here we are with a much bigger bill.”

The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, 56-1. Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Cherry Valley, cast the only no vote.

The language the Senate passed was an amendment to a House bill that originally dealt with training for 911 dispatchers. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence with the Sente amendments.

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.
But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

When that same energy is directed toward policy and people, toward justice and equity, history can be made.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here. 

When Mississippi’s own Jamal Roberts captured the crown as American Idol’s newest star, it wasn’t just a personal victory. It was a collective affirmation.
Roberts won with the largest vote total in the show’s history, fueled by millions of votes from fans who believed in his voice. People voted from their phones, laptops and tablets, some casting multiple votes in one night. The results were immediate, visible and powerful.
It was a vivid demonstration of the power of participation. But it also highlighted a profound contrast: in civic life, particularly in Mississippi, voter turnout remains inconsistent — and for many, impossible.
Mississippi still has some of the harshest felony disenfranchisement laws in the nation. People who have served their time remain barred from the ballot box unless they obtain a pardon or have their rights restored through an arduous legislative process that rarely grants relief. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, over 200,000 Mississippians are disenfranchised, and many of them are Black — a legacy of Jim Crow that continues to define who gets to fully participate in democracy.

Roberts’ win demonstrates what’s possible when people are moved to act. Imagine that same energy channeled into local, state and federal elections. Imagine Mississippians casting ballots not only for a singer but for their children’s schools, their community hospitals, their roads, water systems and criminal justice policies.
But unlike reality television, the results of voting in a democracy aren’t immediate. Votes cast in August may not change policies by September. Ballots mailed in November may not yield results until months later. Democracy is not designed for instant gratification. It is designed for lasting transformation. That requires patience, persistence and most importantly, participation.
History is rich with examples of what sustained, organized civic action can accomplish.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) began with a single mother whose daughter was killed by a drunk driver. She organized. She lobbied, and she galvanized others into action. Today, thanks to their advocacy, all 50 states have laws that criminalize drunk driving with legal blood alcohol limits, and thousands of lives are saved each year. Change didn’t happen overnight. It happened because people voted, lobbied and stayed engaged.
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids launched a decades-long effort to reduce youth smoking. They mobilized parents, teachers, doctors and young people themselves. Through a combination of public education, local ordinances and federal action, youth smoking has declined dramatically in the U.S.
The Fight for $15 movement, led by low-wage workers demanding a livable wage, began with walkouts and was once considered a political longshot. Today, it has reshaped local economies across the country, resulting in minimum wage increases in cities, counties and states, and is influencing federal policy discussions.
These examples all underscore a key truth: showing up to the polls may not produce the kind of instant results seen in a televised competition, but it is a necessary step toward durable change. Policy requires organizing, coalition-building and a long-game mindset. It involves “We the People” and that includes returning citizens, low-income families, rural voters, young people and everyone in between.
Mississippi has a storied history of both voter suppression and voter courage. From Fannie Lou Hamer to the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, the fight to vote has always been met with resistance but also with resilience. Today, that fight continues, especially for those silenced by a criminal legal system designed to exclude.
The good news is that the blueprint is clear. Vote like Jamal Roberts is counting on it. But also vote like your child’s school lunch depends on it. Like your access to clean water depends on it. Like your loved one’s right to return home from prison and fully participate in society depends on it — because it does.
Whether in-person or absentee, whether at the courthouse or by mail, casting a ballot is a statement of presence. Even when the results aren’t immediate, the act itself is cumulative. It builds pressure. It signals demand. It creates momentum.
Let Jamal Roberts’ victory be more than a moment of celebration — let it be a mirror. Mississippians have already proven the ability to mobilize in historic numbers, helping drive more than 26 million votes to secure Roberts’ win. That level of engagement doesn’t belong solely to the world of entertainment. It belongs to democracy. When that same energy is directed toward policy and people, toward justice and equity, history is not just watched — it’s made.
As Mississippi approaches Election Day on Tuesday, the opportunity to act is here. Let this be a fresh start. The same spirit that voted for Jamal Roberts can show up at the ballot box — whether early, absentee or in-person. Let Mississippi once again show up and show out — not just for a voice on stage, but for the voices in our communities who deserve to be heard, counted and valued.

(Photo provided by Volvo Cars)Volvo Cars has halted production at its Lowcountry plant because of a parts shortage, highlighting the growing supply chain issues automakers nationwide are experiencing in the wake of President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs.
Volvo, which builds the all-electric EX90 sport-utility vehicle at its $1.2 billion plant in Ridgeville, did not immediately specify the parts involved or say how long the shutdown announced Thursday is expected to last.
The carmaker is working with suppliers to resolve the problem and get the factory off Interstate 26 up and running again, according to news reports.
The shutdown comes on the heels of Volvo announcing layoffs affecting 5% of the plant’s workers, or roughly 100 people, and a global workforce reduction of 3,000 employees, most of them at the automaker’s Sweden headquarters.
The layoffs are part of nearly $2 billion in cost reductions Volvo is undertaking as tariffs have roiled global trade.
The EX90, with a list price of $79,995, is the only vehicle Volvo builds at its South Carolina factory.
The company has said it may add production of other vehicles at the Lowcountry site to offset tariffs on imported vehicles, which make up most of Volvo’s most popular sellers in the United States.
The EX90 is the flagship model in Volvo’s pledge to build an all-electric lineup, but its sales have lagged far behind the brand’s other gas-powered and hybrid models.
Through April, Volvo sold 4,051 EX90s worldwide compared with sales topping 80,293 for its most popular XC60 mid-sized SUV.
All told, EX90 sales have made up about 1.8% of Volvo’s 231,100 global sales through April.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Members of the Legislative Education Study Committee voiced concerns this week about the tight deadline the New Mexico Public Education Department has to meet new court orders in the longstanding lawsuit concerning equitable public education.
The LESC met for the first time during the interim Thursday and received an update on the Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit. Parties in the case returned to court last month to consider a motion of non-compliance filed by the plaintiffs in September 2024. First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs that the PED has not complied with previous court orders and ruled the state needs to produce a plan for providing equitable education for at-risk students and tracking progress.
According to court documents, the PED must identify an outside expert to assist with the development of the plan and file a status report by July 1. A draft plan must be filed with the court by Oct. 1 and a final plan must be available for review by the court by Nov. 3. 
Lawmakers questioned PED representatives about the court order and whether the department will be able to meet Wilson’s timeline.
“We are going to do whatever it takes to meet these deadlines,” PED Sec. Mariana Padilla told committee members. “We are not starting from scratch…we have so much ready to build upon, which is why I feel that this is doable. Is it going to be difficult? Absolutely.”
PED Assistant Secretary of Policy and Technology Greg Frostad told lawmakers that the department is currently working to identify an outside expert “as quickly as possible.”
Rep. Patricia Roybal Caballero (D-Albuquerque) encouraged Padilla to take into consideration the voices of stakeholders from outside the PED, including advocacy organizations and the plaintiffs in the suit. She also asked Padilla to use the plaintiff’s motion as a guide when implementing the plan because it outlined nine primary goals for creating a multicultural and multilingual educational framework; an education workforce; increasing technology access; developing methods of accountability; and strengthening the capacity of the PED.
“We’re too programmed,” Roybal Caballero said during the meeting. “It takes a great deal of resolve…and commitment to say, ‘I’m going to take that bold leap and step outside of what I’m familiar with.’ Trust the experts that come from our state of New Mexico, the experts that have been delivering this core education to our students, despite or in spite of PED, and trust that what they said and stated and presented in the plaintiff’s motion is valuable.”
President Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) said she agreed with her colleague’s sentiments, but added that she believes the PED “has stepped up in a huge way” to address the court’s original findings in the suit: that the state was not providing Native students, English language learners, low-income students and students with disabilities equitable education they constitutionally have a right to. 
“I’ll say that I think part of our issue is that we lost our first judge. [The late] Judge [Sarah] Singleton listened to this for years and ruled, and I believe that she kind of understood where the problems were. But she’s no longer with us, and that has, I think, produced all of this lack of focus for all of us,” Stewart said. “I think this is a much bigger picture and I like the idea of an outside expert that will come in and look at everything we’ve done…Because we’ve not been doing nothing; we’ve been doing a lot.”

A Georgia Public Service Commission candidate will remain on the Democratic primary ballot after appealing a decision this week disqualifying him from the race for failing to meet residency requirements.
A Fulton County Superior Court hearing is scheduled for June 10 when Chief Judge Ural Glanville will hear arguments on PSC candidate Daniel Blackman’s appeal. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger had affirmed a state court judge’s ruling that Blackman was unable to provide evidence that a Fulton County property is his primary domicile.
Blackman is a candidate for District 3, which includes Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties. Commissioners are elected statewide but must be residents of a given district for at least 12 months.
Blackman served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator under the Biden administration, and he’s a former PSC candidate who came close to winning a seat on the commission back in 2020.
Blackman’s lawyer, Matthew Wilson, said Blackman’s name will remain on ballots after Glanville granted an injunction Thursday.
“Once we’re given the opportunity for a fair hearing, I’m confident that Daniel will prevail because all of the facts and all of the law are on his side,” Wilson said Friday.
The complaint against Blackman was filed by Atlanta resident Rodney Stephens, who currently resides in a home previously owned by another Democratic candidate, Keisha Waites, according to online county property records.
Stephens and Waites declined to comment about the residency challenge.
The residency dispute involves a one-bedroom dwelling in Atlanta that Blackman leased on Oct. 4, 2024. Blackman testified that he purchased the property to live closer to work while his wife and children continued to reside in their Forsyth County home north of Atlanta, according to the 12-page ruling.
The state court judge wrote that Blackman failed to provide evidence that he actually lived in the home, such as utility bills or mail being delivered to the Atlanta address.
Early voting for two PSC seats began Tuesday with Blackman’s name on ballots statewide. If Blackman’s ban is permanent, notices will be placed in polling places advising voters of his disqualification and votes cast for him will not be counted, Raffensperger’s office said. Election Day is June 17.
Three other Democrats appear on the District 3 PSC ballot: Waites, a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative; Peter Hubbard, founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions, and Robert Jones, a former utility executive. The winner will face GOP incumbent Fitz Johnson in the Nov. 4 general election. Johnson was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021.
Jones said Friday he would like to see an expedited final decision in the Blackman case so candidates can focus solely on their own campaigns without having to deal with the distraction.
“The appeal filed Wednesday was another surprise in a race that has had too many,” Jones said.

(Photo courtesy of the Thrasher family)Former House Speaker and Florida State University President John Thrasher died Friday, a month after announcing a cancer diagnosis. 
Thrasher was president of FSU from 2014 through 2021, the culmination of a lengthy legislative career that began with him lobbying for the Florida Medical Association and eventually led him to serve in both chambers of the Florida Legislature. 
He served in the Florida Senate, starting in 2009 and leaving in 2014, and in the Florida House for eight years, starting in 1992 and terming out in 2000. Thrasher was speaker of the chamber for his last two years. 
On Aug. 19, FSU’s campus will host Thrasher’s celebration of life in the Ruby Diamond Concert Hall. The family plans a private burial in Orange Park for Thrasher.
“John lived a remarkable life — and he made a big difference in the lives of so many in our state,” Gov. Ron DeSantis posted to X. 
Thrasher was an alumnus of the school he led, earning his bachelor’s and law degrees from FSU. In between the two degrees, he served in the U.S. Army and received two Bronze Stars for his service in Vietnam and the Army Commendation Medal in Germany. 
Florida Board of Governors Vice Chair Alan Levine, who served on the board during Thrasher’s presidency, spoke to Thrasher’s legacy in a text message to the Phoenix.
“Florida lost a giant, today. From his leadership and support of his beloved FSU to every issue important to Florida, John led with integrity,” Levine wrote. “My prayers are with my friends in Tallahassee and with those who’ve known John, because this one hurts, and a lot of good people are in pain today. Rest Peacefully, John. Your work here may be done, but your legacy will never be forgotten.”

The Southern Group, the lobbying firm Thrasher co-founded, announced on April 22 that the former president was receiving treatment for cancer at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare. 
After retiring as FSU president, Thrasher returned to The Southern Group in 2021 and served on the faculty of the FSU College of Law. 
Thrasher was chair of the Republican Party of Florida for a year in 2010 and 2011. 
“John Thrasher was a mentor, a patriot, and a man of integrity. His faith never wavered, his principles never faltered, and his love for this state was unmatched,” RPOF Chairman Evan Power said in a news release, adding that Thrasher “unified and stabilized” the party during his stint as chairman. 
Thrasher also served on the Clay County School Board and as the first chair of the FSU Board of Trustees. 
“From the battlefields of Vietnam where he returned as a highly decorated officer, to years of honorable service as Speaker of the House, Rules Chair of the Senate, and President of Florida State University, John was regarded by all as a strong, fair leader with unquestionable judgment, timeless principles of honor, and a gentleman all the way through,” Senate President Ben Albritton wrote in a letter Friday to sitting senators, announcing Thrasher’s death.
‘Student success’
FSU credits Thrasher for “substantial investments in student success initiatives,” increased graduate enrollment, and milestones in faculty hiring and research funding. 
Thrasher’s successor at FSU, President Richard McCullough, said he and his wife will “always remember the kindness” Thrasher and his wife, Jean, extended when he became president. “They made it their mission to help us feel at home in Tallahassee,” McCullough wrote in a statement posted to social media.
“John had a remarkable ability to bring people together with his warmth, humor, and unmistakable charm,” McCullough wrote.
Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried joined the outpouring of condolences on social media. 
“While we cheered for different teams, politically and collegially, he never let that impact our friendship. He was a great leader, true public servant and a terrific human being. RIP,” Fried posted to X. 
Florida Sen. Shevrin Jones called Thrasher “a good one” and “a true statesman, and a good man.”
FSU football alum and Florida Sen. Corey Simon said he is “deeply saddened,” also calling Thrasher “a true statesman.”
“John was a champion for FSU and served Florida and his country with honor. His legacy of service and commitment to education will live on for generations,” U.S. Rep. Jimmy Patronis posted to X. 
“The Lion of the Senate has passed. John Thrasher was a great mentor and friend. He fought the good fight. His legacy will continue on for generations,” Thrasher’s former Senate colleague, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, posted to X.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Democrats opened their “fight back” tour Thursday night in the capital city, drawing more than 220 people to sit through rain showers and talk about the importance of strengthening their party’s voice in upcoming elections.
“There’s a lot to lose, so we have a lot to fight for,” said Carla Gardner, of Lawrence, as she waited in line to get into the event. “It’s sad that in 2025 we feel we have to fight back. But a lot of, well, women, potentially, could lose, the LGBTQ+ community, health care, veterans — there are just so many groups, people of color, just all the marginalized groups, that stand to lose a lot more. We have to fight back.”
Linda Manley and Sarah Ruiz, both of Topeka, said they attended the rally because they feel the need to get involved more at the local level after watching national news.
Why did they come listen to Democrats in the rain?
“The chaos in the world and trying to find out what we can do,” Ruiz said.
“Loss of our Constitution, loss of our courts, checks and balances — I know it needs to start locally,” Manley added.
Their words were echoed by many of the House Democrats in attendance, as well as Gov. Laura Kelly, who spoke briefly at the event.
“This was exactly the right response to what happened in November of 2024, in this last legislative session,” she said. “We need to be out there now and forever, leading up to the August 2026 primary when, in addition to electing candidates, we also have to make sure that we defeat that amendment to elect our Supreme Court justices.”
Kelly referred to a proposed constitutional amendment that would put Kansas Supreme Court justices on the ballot, instead of the governor appointing one of three finalists selected by a nonpartisan review panel.
“I don’t know about you, but I have no interest in being like Wisconsin on this where there are millions and millions of dollars coming into that state to sway the one group that is supposed to be impartial and not motivated by political leanings,” the governor said.
Kelly encouraged everyone in attendance to “learn to speak Republican” and talk to people throughout the state.
“Talk about the issues that matter to people, and talk about electing a person, not a party,” she said.

Rep. Susan Ruiz, before the event started, emphasized that same message. The Shawnee Democrat said anyone paying attention to what happened in the Legislature during the recent session should be concerned.
A more collaborative relationship is needed in the Statehouse to push forward things Kansans care about, she said.
“I want to see more Democrats running and winning so that we can have a fighting chance,” she said, referring to the Republicans’ supermajority. “But it would be nice to see some moderate Republicans also win because we can band together. There’s a lot of things that we can do together that would be good for the majority of the people in the state, and not the Koch brothers of the world.”
Rep. Kirk Haskins, a Topeka Democrat, said before speaking at the event that the fight back tour, which will go to at least 11 more stops throughout the state, is important to get messaging out for the Democrats.
“There’s a lot of Kansans that have had their opinion not heard,” he said. “For example, 80% of Kansans want us to see some sort of expansion of Medicaid, but yet it doesn’t come up. We also feel like it’s time for the House Democrats to lead the opportunity for them to be heard, and so we’re traveling across with an agenda purpose to share what’s happening, but also to learn, not just from Democrats, but from all Kansans.”
Haskins said he’s been concerned about how business is being conducted at the Statehouse, and also what is happening at the federal level. Important items are buried in details, for instance. 
“We saw this during the past session many times over,” he said. “Property tax relief started off as something they campaigned on, but then when it came out, they’re making sure that luxury jets get property tax relief.”
The gathering drew former elected officials like Joan Wagnon, who served in the House and as Topeka mayor, along with 13 current representatives and senators, Kansas Board of Education members, Topeka Mayor Michael Padilla and others.
After Kelly spoke, a panel made up of House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, of Lenexa, and Topeka Reps. Alexis Simmons, John Alcala, and Haskins answered questions from the audience.
Those questions focused primarily on what actions people could take to make a difference, as well as concerns about Medicaid cuts and mental health services.
The panel encouraged people to contact their legislators, to go to their offices and be heard. 
“I’m on my soapbox. Settle in,” Simmons said, drawing laughs. “Y’all know how many races in the state of Kansas, in the state Legislature, are won or lost by only double digits? It’s crazy. There are so many. We just lost a state senator in Leavenworth — he lost by 31 votes.”
Simmons encouraged people to talk to everyone and tell them to vote all the way down the ballot.
“Do not vote only for president. Don’t vote only for Congress. Vote all the way down,” she said.
The next fight back tour events will be in Wichita on June 5 and Newton on June 6. Details are on the House Democrats Facebook page.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sarah-ruiz-manley-1024x706.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

(Photo by Tang Ming Tung/Getty Images)A new COVID-19 variant fueling a global rise in cases has been detected in Washington, but health officials aren’t too concerned.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the variant in a sample collected May 15 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the state Department of Health. As of Thursday morning, that’s been the only case confirmed in Washington, and it’s unclear whether the May 15 case was in a state resident or a visitor.
The case was found through the CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance that detects COVID through voluntary nasal swabs and wastewater samples at a number of American airports.
Washington is one of a handful of states where a case has been reported.
As its prevalence has grown quickly around the world, the World Health Organization has designated the new variant, NB.1.8.1, as one “under monitoring.” NB.1.8.1 is fueling a spike in infections and hospitalizations in China, for example.
But the organization believes the variant doesn’t lead to more severe illness than current versions of the virus. Local health officials agree.
“In general, I think that there’s low concern,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer with the state Department of Health. “But I think with any new variants, we really do need to monitor them.”
Current vaccines are expected to remain effective against NB.1.8.1.
But the new variant comes as the Trump administration has shifted vaccination guidelines.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. The Trump administration has also limited eligibility for the vaccine, holding it should only be given to people over 65 or those with risk factors from other medical conditions.
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would require new testing to prove the shots are effective for younger people.
Critics see these moves as unnecessary and dangerous.
Less than one in five Washingtonians received a COVID vaccine booster this season, according to state data.

[…]","FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob addresses a crowd at the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute's 2025 Policy Summit on May 30, 2025 to discuss the agency and Medicaid policy. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)When it comes to the Family and Social Services Administration — which oversees Medicaid alongside other state programs like child care subsidies — Gov. Mike Braun “inherited a mess,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said Friday. 
Roob is taking his second turn leading the agency, which has the single largest budget due to its federal funding. Previously, he led FSSA under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. 
Donning his now-standard “Make Medicaid Boring Again” hat, Roob said the state had “no other choice” than to make the program more sustainable and fiscally sound. He spoke at the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute’s 2025 Policy Summit in Indianapolis. 
“Very few people wear — other than (President) Donald Trump — wear their job description on their hat, but I do,” said Roob. “That is our task for the next four years.”
House GOP overwhelmingly votes to impose Medicaid work requirements

Under Daniels, Roob launched the earliest version of the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers moderate-to-low-income Hoosiers but has grown since its first iteration. HIP 3.0, on the other hand, would return to its roots and “inject personal responsibility for able-bodied adults again,” Roob said, putting it into alignment with federal discussions on work requirements for the Medicaid program.
Also in his first term, Roob said the agency conducted monthly finance reporting and other fiscal checks to tamp down on spending. He said departing from that norm in subsequent administrations is when the program went awry, pointing specifically to cost growth for applied behavior analysis therapy and attendant care.
The former is a treatment sought by some parents with autistic children while the latter is a program that previously allowed parents to be paid as caregivers for their children with complex medical needs. 
“… that lack of accountability, that lack of paying attention to the dollars is why we had ABA therapy growing at a pace that we did. It’s why we had attendant care growing at the pace that it did,” said Roob. “It’s very difficult to put that genie back in the bottle here because, in both of those cases, we had created, inadvertently, a dependency.” 
He never specifically named former Gov. Eric Holcomb in his criticism.
 Details on health programs

In 2019, Indiana’s Medicaid program spent $120 million on ABA therapy, but the program ballooned to $639 million by 2023. In response, Braun established a panel to consider cost controls earlier this month. 
“If you think this is sustainable, you’re budgeting at the federal level,” quipped Roob. “Because this will bankrupt Indiana.” 
Similarly, attendant care costs for parents of disabled children grew rapidly during that time span. Roob said the agency spent $11 million monthly in July 2020 but the number soared to $84 million each month by May 2024, when the agency diverted parents to a structured family caregiving program that paid at a lower rate. 
Combined, Roob said those numbers contributed to a December 2023 state forecast determining Indiana was $1 billion short in its Medicaid budget. 
Providers, seniors continue to experience challenges under PathWays program

“Many folks look at the Medicaid program and they go, ‘How did you get in debt a billion dollars?’ Well, it’s because you have so many more people receiving care and help. Because we are paying so much more for very discrete parts of the agency,” Roob said. 
Another program that transitioned care for elderly Hoosiers from state oversight to a contract with insurers — known as managed care entities — would “never” be something he would pursue, said Roob. 
“I have been quite clear this program … I never would implement (it),” said Roob. “Because it’s very difficult for managed care companies to manage the care of individuals who are in nursing homes. What is the value?”
Early pitches said the PathWays to Aging program would deliver savings because the state would pay a flat fee for Hoosiers and private companies would manage their care, rather than Indiana paying piecemeal for every cost. However, the transition to get there “is very difficult,” Roob said.
“We have not, today, seen the results that we are hoping for,” said Roob, adding that the state will pay $300 million extra to the companies in cost overruns this year. “… it’s been painful for everybody involved so far and that pain shows signs of easing — but only signs.”
 Other comments

Roob didn’t limit his criticisms of previous administrations solely to health care programs, also saying there was “a lack of planning” when it came to the state’s child care options. Roughly 75,000 children currently receive some form of child care through the agency, an increase initially funded by federal pandemic dollars, Roob said. 
“Their plan was in April of this year simply to take children off of the child care program with no particular warning,” asserted Roob. “Gov. Braun and the legislature felt that was probably not the best answer, so they have allowed us to create a slope to slowly dr0p people from the child care program. 
“That doesn’t minimize the fact that we’re losing over 20,000 daycare slots for the children of men and women who make below 127% of the poverty level,” continued Roob.

Additionally, the “lack of planning and forethought by our predecessors” meant that there would be even fewer options for parents seeking child care for infants or one year olds. 
Part of the problem with Indiana’s Medicaid spending can be attributed to the state’s high health care costs, an explicit priority for Braun. Since his tenure under Daniels, Roob said the disparity between what Hoosiers pay and what they receive has worsened. 
“When Gov. Daniels was in office, I used to tell people that Indiana residents were buying a Cadillac and getting a Chevrolet,” Roob said. “Unfortunately, today, we’re no longer driving Chevrolet. We are driving a used Kia.”

COOK COUNTY — The day before Christmas eve in 2023, Andrew Ciaccio was up all night trying to soothe his stomach pains.

When he woke, he could barely sit up. Something was wrong.

“It was pretty intense,” he recalled. “I was vomiting and really sweating and really feverish and just really in rough shape. [I] couldn’t even put shoes on.”

Panicked, his partner looked up the nearest hospital: Advocate Masonic Hospital.

Once Ciaccio  got to the hospital, a new panic set in. What should he expect to pay for the surgery? Would the medical care be covered by his insurance? He and his partner didn’t get any answers as forms were thrust upon him to sign to get him into an emergency appendectomy, a surgery that removes an inflamed appendix.

He asked multiple people for a good faith estimate but none could provide one.

Months later, he’d become one of hundreds of thousands of Cook County residents buried under medical debt. Ciaccio who earns between 60,000 and 70,000 a year  is slowly paying off the more than $10,000 in medical bills that the hospital has moved to collections. It will take Ciaccio two to three years to pay it off, delaying his goals of saving for retirement and threatening his ability to rent an apartment and buy a car.



[caption id=""attachment_69103"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] After a health care emergency in 2023, Andrew Ciaccio ended up with $10,000 dollars in medical bills. The debt, he says, is impacting his future. (Akilah Townsend for Illinois Answers Project)[/caption]



His debt was not part of Cook County’s medical debt buy program. But with his income level and the amount of his debt, he possibly could have qualified.

Since 2022, Cook County has spent more than $4 million to forgive nearly $500 million worth of medical debt for some 278,000 residents, becoming a pioneer among local governments and garnering waves of positive publicity for their efforts.

But an analysis of Cook County’s debt relief accounts show that many people like Ciaccio saddled with debt should have qualified for free care, a sign that local hospitals are failing to screen for some of the region’s poorest patients even as some use aggressive tactics to collect debt. And commercial insurance companies are shifting more and more costs onto patients, sinking them into debt.

The data from the Cook County Medical Debt Relief Initiative revealed that a significant number of people whose debts were forgiven through the program made less than 200% of the federal poverty level, a threshold that nearly every major hospital system in Cook County accepts for providing free care. Researchers say this indicates a common problem: patients are not getting the charity care they qualify for at hospitals, and health care policy efforts need to shift to make sure financial help is provided much earlier in the billing process.

Undue Medical Debt, the nonprofit contracted with Cook County to negotiate debt buys with health systems and collections agencies, said there are several reasons the majority of accounts forgiven are from people making below 200% of the federal poverty level. Some of it could be inadequate charity care assessment by providers and reluctance by patients to ask for help or fill out paperwork with their financial information, said Eva Stahl, the Vice President of Public Policy and Program Management at Undue Medical Debt.

Patient income data is collected when the debt is bought. That could be years after a health crisis, and the health crisis itself may have sunk some people into a lower income bracket, according to Undue Medical Debt.

Data from three years of the county’s debt relief program also reveals that insurance holders, like Ciaccio, make up the biggest share of debts forgiven, a sign that insurance coverage is often too thin to handle major medical needs.

Daniel Lempert, a spokesperson for Undue, said Medicaid makes up a small portion of the county’s overall debt because the insurance requires little copayment. Medicare requires higher copayment, but not comparable to those required by commercial insurance and plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

One accounting firm analyzed debt from nearly 1,500 hospitals across the country and found that debt from commercial insured accounts increased from 11.1% of total debt in 2018 to 57.6% in 2021.

“Patients are the collateral damage”

Commercial insurance plans have been shifting costs to patients for decades by increasing monthly premiums and making patients pay increasingly bigger shares of hospital bills. That means that more people making middle-class salaries need help paying for medical care.

The hospital and insurance industries have been pointing fingers at each other for years, blaming the other for saddling patients with crippling debt. Hospitals say insurance companies are covering less to pad profit margins and insurance companies say hospitals’ massive bills forced them to shift costs to patients.

“There is this unsustainable lobby in this war back and forth between these two massive entities that make up a double digit chunk of the US economy. These are Goliaths and patients are the collateral damage,” said Eli Rushbank, the director of policy advocacy at Dollar For, a nonprofit helping patients access charity care.

Sarah Panahi, for example, made about $70,000 a year as a grant writer in Chicago when she was hospitalized in 2023, which would disqualify her from almost every financial aid and charity care program.

But she was already under massive debt, from helping her family with rent, groceries and utility bills and after a drunk driver hit her car so badly she needed to buy a new one.

In an unfortunate twist, the stress of her debts triggered a mental health crisis that required a five day stay at the psychiatric wing of a hospital in December of 2023 that she could not afford.

“My insurance, BlueCross BlueShield PPO, I feel like that’s one of the best you can get,” she said. “I just didn’t know the deductible would be so insane,” she said, referring to the nearly $3,000 she owed for the five day stay. Insurance paid about $10,400, but she owed some $2,000 for the deductible, a $200 copay and another $700 in coinsurance, the billing split between patient and insurer.

“I just have anxiety now, like, even more anxiety than before,” she said. “Am I gonna be able to pay this month? Are they gonna come after me?”


EXPLAINER: What is a deductible? Copay? Coinsurance?
▶︎ Deductible is the amount the patient has to pay before insurance pays anything for hospital stays, tests and procedures.

▶︎ Copay is what the patient has to pay each time they go to the doctor and sometimes emergency room.

▶︎ Coinsurance, which is a somewhat more recent development, is the split between what the insurance pays and the patient pays. So if a patient has a 20% coinsurance, they’d have to pay $2,000 of a $10,000 bill in addition to the deductible.

▶︎ Premium is the monthly cost of having insurance.



Panahi recently called the hospital pleading with them, but the most help they could offer was a payment plan, a couple hundred dollars a month for the next few years.

That means she doesn’t go out to eat, can’t go on dates or other social events.

“I can’t remember the last time I bought a latte,” she said.

The whole experience, including a hospital stay that she found unpleasant and traumatic, has made her scared of going back to an emergency room for care.

“I do not want to step foot in the hospital for as long as I can,” she said.

“I’m trying to take as good care of myself as I possibly can. If I have to go to the hospital for any reason, I literally don’t know what I would do.”

The county’s debt relief program, managed by the nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, buys up debt that’s anywhere from 18 months to 7 or more years old. At that point, patients have likely suffered through aggressive collections tactics, experts say.

 “I just have anxiety now, like, even more anxiety than before… Am I gonna be able to pay this month? Are they gonna come after me?” - Sarah Panahi

An Illinois Answers Project analysis of some of Cook County’s largest hospital systems show that many of them use harmful tactics to force payment out of residents, some of whom are among the poorest in the county. Hospitals might deny medically necessary care, put a lien on homes, garnish wages or hire collections agencies that call and text threatening messages regularly.

Since the early 2000s, hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals that have financial obligations to serve community needs, have come under pressure to reform collections policies as frustrated patients and advocate groups demand change.

Advocate Masonic Hospital where Ciaccio and Panahi were admitted is in the middle of a multi-year effort to scale back harmful collections policy. Last year, Advocate announced it would cancel liens placed on homes and real estate as part of previous efforts to collect on debt. And in 2022, Advocate Health said it would stop reporting debts to credit agencies, make more people eligible for charity care and stop filing lawsuits and seeking liens as part of its collection efforts.

But that’s not what happened for Ciaccio after his health crisis in 2023.

A few months after his procedure, once his bills were overdue, debt collectors threatened to send his bill to the credit agencies, which would have tanked his credit score. He was able to set up a monthly installment plan, but the process took a toll.

“Every time I’d get a letter from them, I’d get this shock or adrenaline or cortisol or just feel fear,” he said. “It’s a scary interaction to have with them because they have all the cards and you’re talking about a lot of money.”

A representative for the hospital did not address the discrepancy but stressed that the hospital is “among the most generous in the country, offering full charity care to patients earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level and significant discounts for many others.”

Relief, but too late

Medical debt relief is still a relatively new concept. Does it work?

That’s what a group of researchers wanted to find out.

Of course, for individuals stressed over debt, the cancellation can be a huge relief.

But one of the first efforts to study the effectiveness of medical debt relief in 2024 revealed that its effectiveness is limited.

Researchers working with Undue Medical Debt found that relief programs are often too late to make a difference.

“We were studying debts forgiven at least a year and a half and sometimes up to seven years after the precipitating event. The debt has already been picked over by debt collectors,” said Neale Mahoney, a Stanford University economics professor and co-author of the study. “People may have already been hardened to the debt collection process. If they get used to ignoring phone calls and letters, they’re outside of the window for follow-up care.”

That’s why charitable organizations and nonprofits can buy older medical debt for a tiny fraction of the original bill: hospitals have largely given up on collecting older debts and efforts to get payments have already done their harm to the patients.

“It’s the result of bad luck, not bad financial behavior, right… You choose to max out your credit card. You choose to buy a car. Most people don’t choose to go to the ER.” - Neale Mahoney, economics professor, Stanford University

“The advice I’ve given to policy makers, local and federal level, is that the research is starting to tell us that we want to pair downstream debt relief with intervention with medical debt closer to the source,” he said.

Undue Medical Debt responded to the study’s conclusions by noting that the organization has made a number of changes since 2018 to 2020, the years researchers examined the group’s impact through buying up debt. Those changes include shifting eligibility to buy debt from higher-income families, erasing debt sooner and supporting financial counseling and insurance coverage navigation to prevent debt.

That could look like improving financial aid provided by hospitals at the front end so that patients won’t have a medical debt burden or other policies aiming to curb harmful collections practices. In the last few years, Undue Medical Debt has been developing a policy advocacy operation to expand its debt relief platform beyond buying up debt.

“They faced some criticism, including from me, saying, focusing entirely on forgiving old medical debt might not really be the solution we think it is,” said Dr. Luke Messac, a doctor and medical debt relief advocate. “It’s really just bailing out debt collectors and hospitals that are particularly unforgiving and doing not as much as we’d hope for the patients.”

One concrete benefit of debt relief, even in the late stages, is that credit scores can go up to allow people to rent better apartments and get better rates for big purchases.

But legislators have also been making changes. In January, an Illinois law went into effect forbidding credit bureaus from factoring in medical debt in credit reports and scores.

That follows a policy shift among three major credit bureaus that erased medical debt under $500 from its reports in 2023.

Medical debt shouldn’t be a measure of a person’s ability to pay back loans because people often don’t choose to need medical care, said Mahoney.

“It’s the result of bad luck, not bad financial behavior, right?” he  said. “You choose to max out your credit card. You choose to buy a car. Most people don’t choose to go to the ER.”

“People are falling through the cracks”

Shepard Searl took a job at Starbucks because they heard the company offered good health insurance.

But as their health deteriorated and monthly health insurance costs went up, it was harder to work the hours needed to cover the cost of managing multiple chronic illnesses.

After a few health emergencies, they went into debt.

“All of these things culminating went from [making debt] something that was manageable to a thing that was suffocating and really dictating every aspect of my life,” they said. “A big chunk of my paycheck was immediately going to paying recurring fees.”

Eventually, Searl had to take a leave of absence from work and their friends set up a GoFundMe to help them pay off medical expenses. Searl now qualifies for Medicaid.

Medicaid is only available to the people making some of the lowest incomes — about $26,650 for a family of three and about $15,650 for an individual. Those who make more, but still qualify for charity care, often slip through the cracks. About 2 in 3 people whose debts were forgiven were making less than 200% of the federal poverty level, or $31,000 a year, the level that would qualify them for these programs and help them avoid medical debt from the outset.

One study estimates that there’s some $14 billion in undistributed charity care that ends up as debt, according to Dollar For, a nonprofit that helps people claim financial aid and charity care from hospitals.

“One thing to realize is that the system itself is broken,” said Stahl.

“We are going to capture people that have gotten lost and fall through the cracks.”

Dollar For found through a survey that more than half of the people eligible for financial assistance never apply, said Rushbanks. That’s because the majority of those people didn’t know they could get financial help and some were confused by the process.

By 2014, Illinois required every hospital to develop a policy that fast tracks certain groups of vulnerable and low-income patients for charity care without requiring them to apply for aid, including several mandatory categories like homelessness and those eligible for medicaid but uninsured when receiving care.

Hospitals in urban areas are also required to automatically provide aid for people whose incomes are below 200% of the federal poverty level or who are eligible for government assistance.

These policies are meant to prevent people who qualify for charity care from getting saddled with debt because they struggle to navigate the financial help application process. But the policies don’t always work, Rushbanks said.

There’s not always an enforcement mechanism. Sometimes patients are required to provide paperwork and documentation that they don’t end up submitting. Other times hospitals may not have a good system for catching people who fit these categories.

And patients, like Searl and Ciaccio, say hospital staff didn’t talk about financial aid until they explicitly asked them about it.

Prevention, not just relief

Once the debt goes into collections, the repeated texts and calls begin.

For Searl, the debt collector with Evanston Hospital was Harris and Harris.

“They would call multiple times a week, send texts multiple times a week, and email multiple times a week,” Searl recalled. “If I answered, they’d try to get me to pay everything upfront. I would explain that I was on a payment plan but couldn’t keep up with larger bills, and then it would be a back and forth until I got them off the line.”

Endeavor Health, the parent company of Evanston Hospital, said they send statements over the course of 120 days before sending the debt to a collection agency and “ensure interactions are respectful and aligns with our values.”

An Endeavor spokesperson also wrote in an email that the health system “proactively” screens patients for charity care eligibility and provides “free care based on a patient’s income in relation to the federal poverty level.”

Decades ago, hospitals would keep debt records without trying to collect them, said Messac. But several big changes at the federal level, after the creation of Medicaid and Medicare programs in 1965, heavily impacted the industry.

For one, hospitals pulled back on charity care, arguing that the most vulnerable people now have government insurance, he said.

The IRS then changed the standard for nonprofit hospitals – from a model of providing as much charity care as financially possible to a more vague standard of benefiting the community, said Messac.

“But it’s kind of nebulous, and hospitals don’t really lose tax exemption if they don’t do enough,” he said.

And as hospitals grow into billion-dollar regional health systems that compete for market dominance, many turned to aggressively pursuing debt to make up for Medicaid and Medicare, which typically reimburses less than private insurers.

Despite its limitations, Cook County’s debt relief program has multiplied in other parts of the country: more than 20 government medical debt relief programs to be exact, according to Rachel Ruttenberg, deputy chief of staff for the Office of the Cook County Council President.

“We started a bit of a movement,” said Ruttenberg.

But the program alone won’t solve medical debt, she said. The ultimate goal is to have accessible and affordable health care for everyone.

“And it honestly allows us to continue talking about medical debt. We understand that this is not a strategy for solving medical debt, but instead, we want to eliminate as much medical debt as possible while continuing to bring attention to the serious issue of medical debt and just showcase how much of a financial burden it is on people,” said Ruttenberg. “The real fix is to have universal health care coverage in this country.”

There have been pockets of success throughout the country when it comes to debt collection reform.

Los Angeles County followed suit with its own medical debt relief program a few years after Cook County. But they don’t just buy up debt.

The county also requires hospitals to disclose key data regarding financial assistance provided and debt collections efforts, including placing a lien on patient’s property, seizing bank accounts, suing patients, garnishing wages or denying care due to debt.

Messac, a longtime advocate for regulating medical debt, also points to North Carolina as an example of successful government intervention.

There, Gov. Roy Cooper leveraged federal funding in exchange for nearly 100 hospitals wiping out billions of dollars of debt and adopting standards that allow more patients to get financial aid. 

For Cook County, the lesson is likely the need for medical debt prevention in addition to debt relief, which she said is also critical, said Mara Heneghan, the former director of policy at the office of the Cook County president. She was part of the team that worked on the launch of the medical debt relief program.

“Ultimately, it’s unsurprising that it’s more helpful to cancel debt earlier on,” she said.

“We need to think about prevention of medical debt, so we’re not putting people in that position.”

You would immediately pull your children out of daycare and report the whole business to the state. 
Why then, are we allowing firearms to be stored in family childcare homes, which are very similar to in-home daycares, without notice to the caregivers so they can make an informed decision on whether to place their child in this home? This is why I am writing in support of Committee Bill 6180.  

Cassidy Irwin
Firearms in the home are a documented danger to children. Children younger than 5 years old are the second most likely age group to accidentally shoot themselves. Children are naturally curious and do not understand the gravity of playing with firearms. This risk is compounded when children are grouped together in an informal setting like a family childcare home. 
Around half of all accidental firearm deaths of children between 2001 and 2021 occurred in their home, whether by playing with the gun or showing it off to other children. Guns can also accidentally fire when stored improperly, potentially injuring those in the area. Research shows that, while children may be safer when unloaded guns are securely stored with ammunition sheltered separately, children are safest when all firearms are stored outside of the home.  
Dissenters may argue that these regulations encroach upon the homeowner’s privacy and their Second Amendment rights. These concerns have merit but, in policy, a balance must be negotiated between the homeowner’s individual rights and the children’s rights to a safe and secure place of education. I support this law because it ensures that caregivers are not unknowingly placing their children into a dangerous situation that could end their life. Caregivers have a right to know that the safety of their child is prioritized. I also support the subsection that allows the Office of Early Childhood to revoke the license of any business found in violation of this requirement. 
However, my only recommendation would be that firearms should not be stored in a residence that is licensed by the state as a family child care home. I think that the license revocation should also apply if the homeowners do not remove the firearms from the residence. If this cannot be achieved, the caregivers should be given more information as to the state of the firearm storage in the home, rather than simply whether or not firearms are present. Parents would not tolerate the presence of guns in a school or a commercial daycare. The same protections should be extended to licensed family child care homes so that parents can send their children to daycare knowing their safety is ensured.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Roughly 150 nurses and their allies gathered at dusk Thursday for a vigil to show support for the strike underway at Meriter hospital in Madison.
The crowd was smaller than the throngs that have gathered outside the hospital during daily picketing and rallies, but the feelings they conveyed were no less intense.
“We’re holding this vigil because beneath the charts, beneath the chants, beneath the signs and beneath the daily strength that it takes to strike is something deeply serious,” said emergency room nurse Shelby Davis. “We’re not just here for better contracts. We’re here for safety, for dignity, for the basic right to care for our patients without risking their lives or our own.”
With the vigil, organized with the involvement of two church pastors, the nurses and their union sought to cast the issues that led to the five-day walkout as a matter of moral principle.
“You are doing holy work,” said Pastor Justin Dittrich of Lake Edge Lutheran Church, opening the vigil at Brittingham Park on Madison’s near South Side, a block from the hospital grounds.
“The strike is not the end, but the beginning of a more just health care system for all people, workers and participants,”  Dittrich added. “We stand with the nurses of Meriter because they are healers, truth tellers, and agents of faith and justice.”
UnityPoint Health-Meriter and Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin are in the midst of negotiations for a new labor agreement for about 1,000 nurses who work at the hospital. The nurses union began a five-day strike Tuesday after a bargaining session May 19 ended without a new agreement, and after the union’s bargaining team said management negotiators were not responding adequately to their concerns about staffing levels, hospital security and compensation.
Negotiations resumed Thursday, during which union bargaining team members reported some progress, and continued on Friday.
Among the union’s primary issues in negotiations has been a demand for specific ratios of nurses to patients.
“Even though I work in the ER and not on the floor, I see how staffing levels affect every part of the hospital,” said Davis. “I’ll never forget the one moment during my nurse residency, a new grad was recognized for taking care of seven patients on their own. Seven. That wasn’t a badge of honor, that was a red flag.”
The hospital management has said dictating ratios would interfere with its need for flexibility to respond to changing conditions.
Speakers said the demand is not just in the interest of nurses, but a matter of concern for patients as well.
“Ratios are for us — yeah, absolutely,” said nurse Dara Pierce. “But they’re also for everybody else and I think sometimes that goes unnoticed.”
The fear of violence in the workplace has driven nurses to demand a stronger role in formulating security policy, speakers said, along with measures such as metal detectors.
“We’ve had violent or unpredictable situations come through our doors with just one security guard assigned to ER and no metal detectors,” said Davis. “No one should have to feel unsafe when they’re coming to a hospital and no nurse should be expected to risk their life just to do their job.”
The lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began five years ago, continues to weigh on health care workers, nurse Annette Bernas told vigil participants.
“We were considered essential, but let’s be honest, we were expendable,” she said. “We didn’t complain. We showed up. We held hands when family members couldn’t.”
As the pandemic laid bare the importance of health care and health care workers, “we were hopeful that everything we gave would open the eyes of the world to the importance of nurses and support staff,” Bernas said. “But here we find ourselves in a deeper crisis. The burnout is real. Nurses are leaving in waves. PTSD from those years is something we still carry, and yet we’re being asked to do more with less.”
After the speeches the crowd walked behind a large yellow banner, carrying flickering candles from the park to the hospital entrance on Brooks Street.
There Pastor Raymond Monk of Milwaukee offered a benediction. 
“This new course has caused many of you all to make a decision to make sure that your voices are heard and the voices of those who are hurting, their voices are heard also,” said Monk. “I want to encourage you at this pivotal moment in history to continue to defy the norms and to make known to the world that things must change and that things must change right now.”
Faith upholds their cause, he suggested, adding that God “is always on the side of the oppressed.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.A bill that would overhaul Vermont’s response to homelessness is headed to Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s desk, after a largely party-line vote in the House on Thursday evening. Scott and members of his administration have remained mum about whether they support its final iteration. If Scott vetoes the bill, he could effectively kill it. Without a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers are unlikely to have the votes to override.Asked at his weekly press conference whether he would greenlight the legislation, Scott said that he had not yet read the final version of the bill, but indicated that lawmakers “would have had to move a long ways” before gaining his signature. In a separate interview, Department for Children and Families Commissioner Chris Winters said administration officials were still combing through the details.“We’ve started our deep dive to make sure that we understand the full impacts of this bill, and whether it’s possible to make transformational change this year,” Winters said on Thursday afternoon.The bill, H.91, would shift Vermont’s homelessness response system from one centered on state government to one administered by private nonprofit organizations. The change would mark a fundamental pivot in how the state approaches homelessness, which has skyrocketed in Vermont in recent years amid a crushing housing shortage and rising housing costs. The bill dissolves the statewide motel voucher system next July, and hands over funding and decision-making power for emergency shelter to five regional anti-poverty nonprofits and the statewide domestic violence organization. It also gives those groups authority over funds the state currently doles out to build and operate local shelters and run homelessness prevention programs. The state would retain an oversight role.The new regionalized system would be dubbed the Vermont Homeless Emergency Assistance and Responsive Transition to Housing Program, or VHEARTH. Its supporters argue that it would create a more efficient and integrated support system for Vermont’s growing homeless population — and allow the state to stop relying on motel and hotel rooms to shelter the bulk of unhoused Vermonters, an issue that has become a perennial political football at the Statehouse.“I think that this puts Vermont on a path forward that is going to be more focused on prevention, [and] reducing and hopefully eventually eliminating the use of the hotels in favor of shelter and more supportive services,” said Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, the bill’s chief architect.Angling for Phil Scott’s signatureScott has long called for the motel voucher program’s pandemic-era expansion to end, and administration officials this year have expressed general support for restructuring the state’s homelessness response system. But they have sparred with lawmakers over key details of the proposed transition. Officials have raised concerns around the ongoing costs of the new initiative, and expressed a desire to speed up the shift of the motel voucher program to the new, localized system.As House and Senate members hashed out their differences over the bill this week, gaining approval from Scott arose as a key concern around the negotiating table. In a bid for his support, lawmakers cut down on a $10 million allocation meant to aid the transition to the regional system by axing $3 million earmarked for shelter development. They also struck provisions that expressed an intent to tie future emergency housing spending to recent years’ budgets, and included language requiring the use of motel rooms to decrease as shelter capacity increases and homelessness numbers drop.Lawmakers also added a provision that “specific elements” of VHEARTH can take effect sooner than planned if state officials and community action agency directors come to an agreement before July of 2026. Some of those directors have balked at the prospect of a faster transition.Winters pointed to some of these changes as positive steps, but did not indicate whether they would be enough to earn Scott’s signature. The administration had wanted lawmakers to add more vetting criteria for people entering the motel program in the coming fiscal year, including verifying their residency in Vermont, their income, and their lack of alternate housing options. Officials also hoped lawmakers would add language allowing them to prioritize the “most vulnerable” clients, rather than relying on a first-come, first-served system.The purpose of those provisions would be to allow the state “to wrangle the [motel voucher program] down to a more manageable size,” Winters said. How quick of a change?The administration had also favored a phased transition to the new regional system, where the motel voucher system would get shifted first, and the funding for local shelter operations would transition in fiscal year 2028. But in a committee of conference, lawmakers aligned the timelines for both transitions to fiscal year 2027, which begins next July.Some directors of local shelters have vehemently opposed transitioning the funding for their work in H.91 at all, arguing that the change could create conflicts of interest in spending decisions, and would destabilize the state’s shelter system at the exact moment federal funding for housing and homelessness programs could disappear.Other critics of the regionalization effort have argued it amounts to an abdication of responsibility by state leaders for Vermont’s worsening homelessness problem.When the Legislature and the administration have placed restrictions on the motel voucher program in recent years — resulting in wave after wave of evictions — “all of our emails light up,” Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, told her colleagues on the floor last week. Her concern, Cummings said, was that by shifting responsibility for emergency housing over to the regional nonprofits, pressure on state officials would wane – and people experiencing homelessness would disappear from public view.“We won’t be the bad guys anymore. The administration won’t be the bad guys,” she said. “It will be very easy for these people to slip under the radar.” (Cummings ultimately voted in favor of the bill).Read the story on VTDigger here:  Phil Scott remains silent on session’s biggest homelessness bill as it heads to his desk.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/housing-conference-1-20250528-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

Free.,"U.S. Supreme Court permits deportation of another half million migrants, for now",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-permits-deportation-another-half-million-migrants-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Friday said it will allow the Trump administration to remove deportation protections for more than 500,000 nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who were given permission to temporarily remain and work in the United States by the Biden administration.The move by the high court — which permits the deportations while a lawsuit continues to work its way through the courts — came after a district court in Massachusetts in April blocked the Trump administration from ending the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, or CHNV, program for 532,000 people.It’s the second decision by the Supreme Court this month stripping immigrants of some form of temporary legal protections, affecting more than 800,000 people in the country without permanent legal status who are now subject to swift deportation.On May 19, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status for 350,000 Venezuelans who were granted the protection from deportation because their home country was deemed too unstable to return to due to the political regime.Friday’s case is one of several immigration-related emergency requests the Department of Justice has brought to the high court, as the Trump administration aims to carry out mass deportations, wind down temporary legal pathways for immigrants and redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.No judicial review for parole, DOJ arguesIn the emergency filing to the high court in Friday’s case, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the Immigration Nationality Act bars judicial review of discretionary decisions, such as what is called humanitarian parole, for the CHNV program.He added that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem terminated the program because it does not align with the interests of the Trump administration.Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.“The Court has plainly botched this assessment today,” Jackson wrote in her dissent. “It undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the Government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.”She argued that the Trump administration did not prove it would be harmed by the preliminary injunction. An appeals court previously rejected the government’s request to put the lower court’s order on hold.“While it is apparent that the Government seeks a stay to enable it to inflict maximum predecision damage, court-ordered stays exist to minimize—not maximize—harm to litigating parties,” Jackson wrote.President Joe Biden created the CHNV program in 2023. It temporarily granted work permits and allowed thousands of nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to remain in the country if they were sponsored by someone in the United States and passed a background check.",,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 15:43:01+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration lists CT as ‘sanctuary’ jurisdiction. AG Tong is pushing back,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/30/ct-sanctuary-jurisdiction-william-tong/,The Trump administration put more than 500 'sanctuary jurisdictions' on notice that it views them as obstructing immigration enforcement.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Homeland Security is putting more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions” across the country on notice that the Trump administration views them as obstructing immigration enforcement as it attempts to increase pressure on communities it believes are standing in the way of the president’s mass deportations agenda.
The department on Thursday published a list of the jurisdictions and said each one will receive formal notification that the government has deemed them noncompliant and if they’re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes. The list was published on the department’s website.
“These sanctuary city politicians are endangering Americans and our law enforcement in order to protect violent criminal illegal aliens,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release.
The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren’t doing enough to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it seeks to make good on President Donald Trump’s campaign promises to remove millions of people in the country illegally.
The list was compiled using a number of factors, including whether the cities or localities identified themselves as sanctuary jurisdictions, how much they complied already with federal officials enforcing immigration laws, if they had restrictions on sharing information with immigration enforcement or had any legal protections for people in the country illegally, according to the department.
Trump signed an executive order on April 28 requiring the secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general to publish a list of states and local jurisdictions that they considered to be obstructing federal immigration laws. The list is to be regularly updated.
Federal departments and agencies, working with the Office of Management and Budget, would then be tasked with identifying federal grants or contracts with those states or local jurisdictions that the federal government identified as “sanctuary jurisdictions” and suspending or terminating the money, according to the executive order.
If “sanctuary jurisdictions” are notified and the Trump administration determines that they “remain in defiance,” the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security are then empowered to pursue whatever “legal remedies and enforcement measures” they consider necessary to make them comply.
There’s no specific or legal definition of what constitutes a “sanctuary jurisdiction.” The term is often used to refer to law enforcement agencies, states or communities that don’t cooperate with immigration enforcement.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong pushed back after the state was included on the list. He said the label was inaccurate.
“There is nothing in our laws or statutes that says Connecticut is a ‘sanctuary’ state. We are not. That is a meaningless term,” Tong said in a statement Friday. 
“It is the policy of the State of Connecticut to respect, honor and protect immigrants and immigrant families in compliance with the law. Trump’s own administration certified Connecticut’s compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373 in 2017. Nothing has changed to alter that certification, other than Trump’s unhinged fixation on defunding and commandeering our police,” Tong said.
ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide, but often seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.
One way that the administration seeks to enlist state and local support is through 287(g) agreements with local law enforcement agencies. Those agreements allow local law enforcement agencies to assume some immigration enforcement duties and greatly expand ICE’s capabilities. The number of those agreements has skyrocketed in just a matter of months under the Trump administration.
ICE has about 6,000 law enforcement officers — a number that has remained largely static for years — who are able to find, arrest and remove immigrants it is targeting. By relying on local law enforcement, it can quickly scale up the number of staff available to help carry out Trump’s mass deportations agenda.
Communities that don’t cooperate with ICE often say they do so because immigrants then feel safer coming forward if they’re a witness to or victim of a crime. And they argue that immigration enforcement is a federal task, and they need to focus their limited dollars on fighting crime.
“Sanctuary policies are legal and make us all safer,” said a coalition of local officials from across the country and a nonprofit called Public Rights Project in a statement Thursday. They said the list was a fear tactic designed to bully local governments into cooperating with ICE.
The Trump administration has already taken a number of steps targeting states and communities that don’t cooperate with ICE — and has met with pushback in the courts. One executive order issued by Trump directs the Attorney General and Homeland Security Secretary to withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. Another directs federal agencies to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”

Building trades push for data center tax incentives
With Democrats and Republicans at an impasse over an infrastructure spending package, building trade unions are banking on lawmakers extending tax breaks for data centers to spur investment in high-paying construction jobs.
The push comes as President Trump’s federal funding cuts and ongoing trade war, compounded by high interest rates, have soured the economic outlook for construction jobs.
“There’s not a surplus of work right now,” said Richard Kolodziejski, government affairs director for the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters.
Building one large data center can cost upwards of $1 billion, dwarfing the roughly $700 million bonding bill Minnesota lawmakers could authorize this year to pay for water treatment plants, roads and other infrastructure.
The building trades unions warn that Minnesota will lose jobs to neighboring states if it doesn’t compete on tax breaks to entice tech giants like Amazon and Meta to build data centers. The tax incentives also help justify prevailing wage requirements, which ensures much of the construction will be done by union workers.
But some progressive lawmakers chafe at the idea of giving tax breaks to some of the richest companies in the world while the state stares down a looming budget deficit. They aren’t convinced these projects wouldn’t be built anyways given the state’s cold climate and strong economy.
“I understand not wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy, but those are the folks creating the jobs,” said Tom Dicklich, executive director of the Minnesota State Building & Construction Trades Council.
One hyperscale data center costing $750 million creates upwards of 1,800 construction jobs and 300 ongoing operational jobs, according to a 2022 report on Wisconsin by Mangum Economics, which has produced similar reports sponsored by tech and energy companies for Virginia and Illinois.
A coalition of building trades unions, energy companies and other businesses cited that report in a letter to lawmakers urging them to extend the sales tax exemption on software, servers and other equipment used to power the data centers.

The growing cost of tax breaks for data centers has vexed public sector unions, who see the lost revenue cutting into funding for the schools, nursing homes and state agencies where their members work.
The public sector unions — SEIU, Education Minnesota, AFSCME, MAPE and Inter Faculty Organization — signed onto a letter opposing an early version of the bill (HF1277) backed by the building trade unions, pointing out that the cost of the sales tax exemption has increased by more than 20-fold since 2018. That cost is expected to continue to rise, reaching $219 million in forgone sales tax revenue on servers, software and other equipment in fiscal year 2029.
It was a rare instance of discord among unions who are typically disciplined about being unified in public, despite their many differences across industries. Member unions of the Minnesota AFL-CIO had signed onto a resolution in support of sales tax exemptions for constructing data centers, but the bill that was introduced in February went further. It extended sales tax exemptions on electricity and allowed data centers to claim the sales tax exemption up front rather than through a rebate, which creates a public record of how much sales tax was lost.
“It would be one thing, if the unions were upfront, that this bill is good for their members … Unfortunately, they want the rest of the Labor Movement to support their lobbying efforts and to call tax cuts for billionaires a ‘pro-labor’ bill. This we cannot do,” SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa President Jamie Gulley wrote in a post to his members in April, explaining his opposition.
The debate was so contentious, Gulley wrote, that one unnamed trade union to threaten to leave the AFL-CIO.
The building trades counter that data centers add to state coffers through other taxes, including income taxes paid by their members.
“We don’t have line items in the state budget that goes directly to the building trades,” Dicklich said. “Where we can get work, we have to go after that.”
Amazon announced amid the ongoing negotiations at the Legislature that the company is suspending plans for a big data center in Becker, the Star Tribune reported.
Head of violence intervention non-profit charged with wage theft
Bishop Harding Smith, the head of the violence intervention nonprofit Minnesota Acts Now, was charged with felony wage theft and theft by swindle in Hennepin County on Thursday for allegedly shorting workers $150,000 from a county contract.
While wage theft is common, charges are still relatively rare even since Minnesota made it a felony in 2019. The first felony wage theft conviction was handed down just last month to a painting contractor for stealing more than $35,000 in wages from workers on an affordable housing project in Minneapolis.
“Bishop Harding Smith failed to pay his employees what he agreed to as part of the contract with Hennepin County and then lied about it when seeking payroll expense reimbursements,” Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement announcing the charges. “As I said when our office secured the state’s first wage theft conviction, this behavior will not be tolerated.”
According to the charging document, Harding signed a contract with Hennepin County in 2021 in which he would be an unpaid volunteer and would pay all other workers $35 an hour. The contract was later updated to increase the contract amount to more than $550,000 and provide Harding with a $35 an hour wage. Investigators found most employees were paid $20 an hour even though he billed the county as if they were paid $35 an hour.
Harding admitted to investigators that he did not pay workers what they were entitled to but denied fraudulent intent, according to the complaint.
Trump flips on Nippon deal with U.S. Steel
In a rare instance of unanimity on the campaign trail last year, both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump opposed Japanese-owned Nippon’s $14.1 billion bid to purchase U.S. Steel.
The politics were simple: The United Steelworkers, representing tens of thousands of workers in purple states like Pennsylvania, fiercely opposed the deal. And in a campaign fought over blue collar workers, supporting a foreign company taking over an icon of American industry would have been unthinkable.
Now back in the Oval Office, President Trump has seemingly flipped on his opposition to the deal, writing on his social media platform last Friday that there will be a “planned partnership” between the two steel giants
Trump said U.S. Steel would remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and the deal would create 70,000 jobs. It’s unclear how a “planned partnership” would be different than a buyout, and as The American Prospect noted, the U.S. Steel website describes the deal as a merger.
United Steelworkers President Dave McCall sent a letter to members, which include 3,500 workers in Minnesota, reiterating his concerns.
“Throughout recent months, as the public conversation has turned to Nippon ‘investing’ in U.S. Steel or ‘partnering with’ U.S. Steel, Nippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel’s facilities if it owned the company outright. We’ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position,” he wrote.
Planned Parenthood lays off 66 across Minnesota and Iowa
  Photo by Dylan Miettinen/Minnesota Reformer.
Federal funding cuts are forcing Planned Parenthood North Central States to close eight clinics across Minnesota and Iowa this summer, laying off 66 workers and reassigning three dozen more.
The health system, which is the main abortion provider in Minnesota, announced the closures last week, blaming a $2.8 million freeze in Title X funding in Minnesota that supports sexual and reproductive health. The organization also cited the near total abortion ban in Iowa following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and House Republicans’ “big beautiful bill,” which defunds Planned Parenthood and makes cuts to Medicaid, which subsidizes care for more than 30% of its patients.
More than 400 workers at the Planned Parenthood affiliate, which covers Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas, unionized with SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa in 2022 and ratified their first labor contract last year.
Megan Amato, a longtime licensed practical nurse in Iowa and Nebraska, said she was devastated by the news in a statement shared by the union.
“When I started 18 years ago, we had 17 clinics in Iowa. After these closures we will be down to two,” Amato said. “I am the only person who does my job in the whole state and I worry about what that means for the future of abortion care in Iowa.”
None of the clinics slated to close in Minnesota provide abortion care, but do provide birth control, education and other health care services. PPNCS said it will continue investing in telemedicine to serve patients, which includes medication abortion for patients with a Minnesota address.
Lawsuit challenging nursing home holiday pay dismissed
In a victory for Minnesota’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by two industry groups challenging the board’s authority to mandate that nursing homes pay workers time-and-a-half on 11 holidays.
The lawsuit was the first legal challenge to the board since the Legislature created it in 2023 to set minimum pay and working standards for nursing home workers across the state.
Trade war shakes global jobs outlook
The International Labour Organization cut its global employment forecast by 7 million jobs as President Trump’s trade war roils the world economy. The United Nations agency previously projected the world would add 60 million jobs in 2025, revising it down to 53 million jobs this week.
According to the report, nearly 84 million jobs across 71 countries are directly or indirectly tied to consumer demand in the United States, which is being throttled by uncertainty and higher prices from Trump’s tariffs. A federal appeals court on Thursday reinstated Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs after the U.S. Court of International Trade paused them on Wednesday.
The International Labour Organization also reported that the share of the world’s gross domestic product going to workers globally ticked down over the past decade from 53% to 52.4%. In other words, less of the world’s income is going to the workers generating that income by creating goods and providing services. While the decline is slight, the International Labour Organization estimates it works out to about $290 less per worker in 2024 purchasing power.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_1065-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

But that punishment doesn’t mean those involved with Robertsville-manufacturer Delta Extraction are out of the Missouri marijuana industry. 
In fact, long after the state initially stripped Delta Extraction of its license in November 2023, regulators approved one of the company’s co-owners — AJO LLC — to take over a cultivation and manufacturing facility in Waynesville in May 2024. It’s a far bigger operation than Delta Extraction, and it also involves several dispensaries as well.
AJO LLC says it was only a passive investor in Delta Extraction, where it owns 50%. The company claims it bought 50% of the Waynesville facility in 2022 and has been running it while awaiting approval of the license transfer last year.
But now Delta’s license revocation is the center of a lawsuit playing out in St. Louis courts between a complex web of shareholders seeking to snatch back ownership of the Waynesville facility from AJO.
They argue the state shouldn’t have given its final approval for the ownership change because of AJO’s involvement in a company that had a marijuana license revoked. 
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the department that oversees the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, said the constitution does allow regulators “to deny approval for ownership changes if approval is not ‘unreasonably withheld.’” 
However, in May 2024, Cox said Delta’s appeal of its license revocation was still pending. The final verdict didn’t come down until nine months later. 
“The totality of the circumstances at the time, including the nature of the ownership change, was not sufficient cause to deny the change,” Cox said.
Cox also said the state’s administrative rules – which the division drafts to interpret the constitution’s intent and that take months to pass – currently do not prohibit individuals who have had a license revoked from acquiring another license. 
The division, Cox said, is “reviewing its rules to add further detail to this authority.” 
 Agent ID revocations

 (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
A scathing 137-page decision issued in February by the Administrative Hearing Commission denying Delta’s appeal of its revoked license concluded the company had a “corporate culture of lax compliance with regulatory requirements.”
Regulators are permitted to revoke agent ID cards for individuals who violate the rules. No one without an agent ID can access a marijuana facility without supervision of someone with a card, though you don’t need one to own or run facilities. 
Within weeks of the Administrative Hearing Commission’s February decision, Cox said the state “revoked several agent IDs for involvement in rule violations associated with Delta Extraction.” 
In March, cannabis regulators issued AJO principal Josh Corson a notice of pending revocation of his agent ID card, according to documents The Independent obtained through Missouri’s Sunshine Law. 
The notice stated that as an owner and manager of Delta Extraction, he was responsible for 17 cited rule violations, including “manufacturing and selling bulk distillate in a false or misleading manner due to the failure to disclose that the distillate contained large quantities of unregulated cannabis.” 
Corson surrendered his agent ID license shortly after receiving the notice, and the other two AJO owners — Ryan Rich and Josh Ferguson — have let their agent IDs expire, Cox said. 
Cannabis regulators revoked the agent ID cards of four of Delta’s contractors as well. 
AJO has been helping run the Waynesville operation since 2022 with Hi-Rise LLC, which is the other 50% owner. Hi-Rise has no ownership interest in Delta Extraction. 
Peter Barden, a spokesman for AJO and Hi-Rise, said the companies “provided complete information” about the owners to the state for the license transfer.
In response to Corson’s agent ID revocation, Barden said AJO “was not managing the Delta Extraction facility. It was a passive investor, and no action of AJO has ever been the basis of any revocation.”
Yet pages of evidence in the Delta Extraction case – including emails, depositions and testimonies from high-level employees – appear to demonstrate AJO was fully involved in Delta’s operations and even initiated the arrangement that led to their revocation.
Barden said AJO “certainly monitors its investments but has not actively managed any manufacturing or cultivation license.” 
 AJO’s lawsuit

 Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
Charles Pullium stood before a St. Louis judge in February in an emergency hearing, anxious to share what he believed would be a smoking-gun update in his lawsuit.
It was just days after Delta Extraction had lost its appeal seeking to get its license to manufacture marijuana products reinstated. 
Pullium is an attorney representing a group hoping to wrestle the Waynesville manufacturing and cultivation license away from AJO and Hi-Rise. 
If Delta Extraction violated state law to the point where its license was revoked, Pullium argued, its leadership shouldn’t have won state approval to operate a different cannabis facility.
“It’s a huge case because it involves the revocation of a license,” Pullium told St. Louis Judge Joan Moriarty at the February hearing. “And why it’s important in this case is because when people apply for a new change of ownership… they have to answer, ‘Have any of you or your owners or anyone had a license revoked or suspended?’”
Pullium argued the Delta revocation was key to settling a three-year legal ownership battle, which ended up in St. Louis court in 2023 when AJO and Hi-Rise filed a lawsuit. 
On one side of the legal battle are AJO and Hi-Rise.
On the other side are 19 named individuals and marijuana companies connected to the deal, including St. Louis-based marijuana company Heya, former Missouri House Speaker Carl Bearden and Delphi Management LLC. They argue the 2022 sale to AJO and Hi-Rise was invalid.
Moriarty disagreed the new information was worth holding an emergency hearing for and made Pullium’s client pay $3,037.50 in attorney fees for AJO and Hi-Rise, which are represented by Dowd Bennett law firm. 
The lawsuit is ongoing.
In January, Scott Sterling, who is involved in the tangled ownership web, filed two complaints with the Division of Cannabis Regulation, alleging that AJO did not provide all the information necessary for the transfer. 
One crucial detail left out, Sterling contends, is that he never signed off on any sale as a 40% owner.
The division has opened an investigation into Sterling’s complaint, Cox said, and it is ongoing. 
Barden said the Waynesville location is legally owned by AJO and Hi-Rise and “current ownership has never had a license revoked.” 
 ‘…a made for T.V. drama’

One of Pullium’s motions in January returned the spotlight to Jason Sparks, one of Delta Extraction’s contractors.
“The facts underlying the Delta scandal read like a made for T.V. drama,” the motion states, “a prior felon… buys out-of-state products from a nameless and unknown ‘network’… which he then illegally turns into uncertified product which he then sells to a complicit Delta, who then illegally sells to unsuspecting dispensaries…”
Sparks was among the four contractors that had their agent IDs revoked in March, and he has a disqualifying felony on his record that was overlooked by the state when he obtained that ID. However, Sparks directs the blame largely at Corson in legal filings in his company SND Leasing’s lawsuit against Delta Extraction. 
In the spring of 2023, the supply for marijuana distillate was low across the state and Delta hired Sparks to make large amounts of distillate that Delta sold to about 100 other Missouri manufacturers. Those manufacturers went on to produce gummies and vapes for their brands, which is why the product recall was so widespread.
At issue was what’s in the distillate. 
Sparks extracted a small amount of THC from Missouri-grown marijuana, which the state heavily regulates. Then he added a large amount of THC oil that was extracted from hemp, a product that is completely unregulated.
Regulators pulled 60,000 products off the shelves in August 2023, arguing the use of out-of-state, unregulated THC oil violated state law and posed a public health risk. 
Corson was “the person who found the supply for the distillate,” a January motion in Sparks’ lawsuit states, and he was the one who signed the contracts. 
In his lawsuit, Sparks points to the testimony from Delta’s COO Rachel Herndon Dunn during an Administrative Hearing Commission hearing in March 2024. Dunn testified that Corson reached out to a large cannabinoid-producing facility in Florida to obtain the hemp-derived THC oil needed to make their recalled distillate.
“Corson went down to tour their labs in Ft. Lauderdale…” Dunn said during the hearing. 
Sparks claims Delta leadership reassured him that cannabis regulators signed off on the extraction process. 
“The reality is that (the state) never gave assurances of regulatory compliance,” the suit states. 
Delta argued hemp is not a federally controlled substance and the state has no authority to regulate hemp-derived THC products — an argument they lost in their appeal. Also, the products went through a final round of testing before they hit the shelves, Delta noted, so they didn’t pose a health risk.
Despite the ownership connection to Delta, state regulators told The Independent they’ve found no evidence of similar practices taking place at the Waynesville facility.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5927-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

Lundegan, who will formally unveil the plans June 3, wants to replicate the Garden of Gethsemane near Jerusalem where the New Testament says Jesus prayed the night before his crucifixion.
Lundergan has commissioned a sculptor in Italy to create life-size bronze statues of Christ and the main characters in the 14 Stations of the Cross, representations of events in the Passion of Jesus Christ, from his condemnation to burial.
A 70-foot cross, equivalent to a seven-story building, will tower nearby. It will be positioned to reflect sun rays during the Easter season onto Station 12, depicting Jesus dying on the cross.
Excavations are underway for the spectacular religious display in front of the Saint Patrick Cemetery in Washington on U.S. 68 about five miles south of the Ohio River. It will include a visitor’s center.

Asked how much the project will cost, Lundergan said it is privately funded by the Lundergan family and receives no tax dollars. “This is a way for my family to do something to show our love for the church and community that mean so much to us.”
Lundergan said that the price of admission will be minimal if any —  in contrast to other religious attractions —  the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter — in Northern Kentucky. Visitors may leave donations, which will be used to maintain the garden and support St. Patrick Church and school in Maysville, Lundergan said.
Family venture
Lundergan grew up, was baptized and married in St. Patrick Church. He attended St. Patrick School. He will be buried someday at St. Patrick Cemetery along with his wife, Charlotte Lundergan. 
Actress and singer Rosemary Clooney, who was born on Front Street in Maysville in 1928 and died in 2002, is buried there. She was the aunt of international movie star George Clooney.

The historic cemetery includes the tombstones of early immigrants from Ireland. 
The bishop of Covington, the Rev. John Curtis Iffert, has leased land to Lundergan, who will give the entire garden to St. Patrick Church once it is completed.
Lundergan, 78, owns several companies in Lexington in the food services and  hospitality industry and emergency disaster services. 
Lundy’s Catering provided food services at the Woodstock revival, the Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500, Pope John Paul II’s celebration of mass with 350,000 in San Antonio in 1987, and presidential inaugurations for Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The Lundergans are close friends to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
President Joe Biden pardoned Lundergan earlier this year for his conviction on federal campaign finance charges involving unreported donations to the 2014 U.S. Senate campaign of his daughter, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Lundergan served time in prison and a halfway house.
Lundergan emphasizes that the garden project is a family venture. Charlotte and he have five daughters and 10 grandchildren.  
To launch planning for the garden project, Lundergan contacted Betty Vento of Mentor, Ohio, an expert on religious statues. She and her husband run Mosack’s, a Christian gifts and book store.
Capturing the ‘spirit of Gethsemane’
“I think this is a fabulous project, nothing like it, I believe, in the United States with bronze statues,” said Vento.  “I understand there is a Stations of the Cross garden in Puerto Rico but it is circular. This one will be on a pathway.”
She said Lundergan called her almost five years ago to pursue the project. “We have moved forward with it and are very excited about it.”

Lundergan commissioned bronze statues by sculptor Reto Demetz. His family business, the Demetz Art Studio, is one of the world’s leaders in producing ecclesiastical art. The studio is located in Ortisei, a small village in Val Gardena, nestled in the Dolomites, the famous mountain range in the heart of the Italian Alps. The studio was founded in 1872.
During the last decades, it has reached worldwide fame for its modern religious sculptures as well as its traditional artworks.
Lexington landscape architect John Carman, of the firm CARMAN, said that when Lundergan first called he was not sure he would have the time to devote to designing the garden. “But it is such a wonderful project, quite unique, I am Catholic, so I was all in,” he said. He worked a year on the design.
Carman said the garden will be a replica of Gethsemane. “The real garden is in a different part of the world, with olive trees. Olive trees do not grow well here.” But visitors “will see a beautiful garden with a lot of flowers and shrubs, some trees, that will capture the spirit of Gethsemane.”
A public groundbreaking ceremony for the project is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday, June 3, at the site. Christian ministers in Mason County have been invited to attend.
The target date for completion of the project is Easter Sunday, April 5, 2026.
A celebration Mass will be held at the church the Thursday before Easter. A Good Friday program will be held at the stations and an Easter sunrise service will offer praise at the garden.

The special screening of the blockbuster horror film included an appearance by Director Ryan Coogler and was made possible by a community petition.
“I have family from Mississippi — my uncle, my grandfather — and I had never been until working on this script,” Coogler said, addressing the crowd. “It really changed me, just to come here.”
The movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint. It’s also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.
“Sinners” composer Ludwig Göransson, actor Miles Canton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening.
“Anytime that filmmakers take the time out to pay homage to the Delta, especially, because we’re the root of music, the blues culture, that means a lot,” said Brandice Brown Williams, a theater teacher who brought two of her students to the screening.
The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current day Clarksdale doesn’t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown. Community organizers decided to change that, starting a petition to invite the cast and crew to Clarksdale and to collaborate on hosting a public screening.
“The love you have for Southern folk, Mississippians and Clarksdale came to life through your commitment to writing us right,” community organizer Tyler Yarbrough said. “We are ready. We are waiting. And we would be proud to welcome you back to where it all began.”
During the screening, the crowd was expressive — in response to various scenes, they gasped, laughed and cheered. Afterward, Coogler and others stayed for a Q&A.
One attendee, Cindy Hurst, praised the film, calling it a “really good visual representation of the beauty of the Black culture.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/30095441/AP25149760873214.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A long time Eastern Kentucky Democrat has announced she is joining the Republican Party. 
Sen. Robin Webb, a Carter County state lawmaker who has served in the state legislature since 1999, was one of two Democrats left in the statehouse representing parts of Eastern Kentucky. The region was once a Democratic stronghold, turning to a Republican area over the last couple of decades. 
She and other Republicans said it was a sign that the Democratic Party isn’t what it once was. 
In a press release from the Republican Party of Kentucky, Webb said that she didn’t leave the Democratic Party, but “the party left me.” She added that her core values have not changed, just “the letter next to my name” and she will continue to focus on issues in rural Kentucky. 
“The Kentucky Democratic Party has increasingly alienated lifelong rural Democrats like myself by failing to support the issues that matter most to rural Kentuckians,” Webb said. “First and foremost, I’m a mother, a rancher, and a lawyer with deep personal and  professional roots in Kentucky’s coal country. As the Democratic party continues its  lurch to the left and its hyperfocus on policies that hurt workforce and economic development in my region, I no longer feel it represents my values. It has become untenable and counterproductive to the best interests of my constituents for me to remain a Democrat.”
Webb thanked Republican Senate President Robert Stivers, other colleagues in the General Assembly and RPK for “the warm welcome.” She said she looks “forward to continuing to focus on sound policy with rural Kentucky’s best interests in mind.”
Webb was elected to the state Senate in 2009 after serving in the House for a decade, making her one of the current longest serving members of the General Assembly. Her district includes the northeastern Kentucky counties of Boyd, Carter, Greenup and Lewis. 
With Webb’s switch, Democrats’ superminority in the Senate dwindles to six members. Republicans now have 32 seats in the chamber. She was often seen as the caucus’ more conservative member, sometimes voting with Republicans on culture war issues, like this year’s bill to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public Kentucky universities. 
Webb was also recently appointed by Stivers as the Senate co-chair of the Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force, which will meet during the interim session. She sponsored a resolution to establish the panel. 
Webb also often worked across the aisle to get legislation she supported past, particularly on agriculture and rural policies. Earlier this year, one of her bills gained passage in both the Republican-controlled Senate and House. Signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, the bill established new allied animal health professional licenses for equine dentistry and animal chiropractic practice.
Rep. Patrick Flannery, an Olive Hill Republican who represents Webb’s home county in the House, said in the press release that the party switch makes sense for Webb and her constituents. 
“Robin and I have always had an excellent working relationship,” Flannery said. “She has served as a mentor to me and many others. We represent the same constituency, and she’s making the same decision that many of our people have already made by changing her registration.
Other Kentucky Republican leaders praised Webb for joining the party. RPK Chairman Robert J. Benvenuti III said in a statement that he met Webb when he was a state representative. 
“I always respected that she approached issues in a very thoughtful and commonsense manner, and that she never failed to keenly focus on what was best for her constituents. It is my pleasure to welcome Sen. Robin Webb to the Republican Party,” he said. “Like countless other Kentuckians, she has recognized that the policies and objectives of today’s Democratic Party are simply not what they once were, and do not align with the vast majority of Kentuckians.” 
Kentucky’s Republican National Committeeman John McCarthy and RNC Co-chair KC Crobsie, of Kentucky, also welcome Webb to the party’s ranks. 
In the statehouse, the lone Democrat in the mountains left is Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty, of Martin.
Webb can seek election again in 2026. She had no opponents in the 2022 election.

On any given night, its rooms are filled with artists, dancers and creatives who have come to build community and hone their crafts. 
This is the home of the Briarwood Arts Center, the creation of Stephen Brown, also known as the hip-hop artist, producer and DJ 5th Child.
“During the pandemic, there was this unhoused population that had an encampment in front of the building, and the gas station next door had become a dumping site. There were huge piles of trash and tires and all sorts of stuff,” Brown said. “It was really frustrating seeing that as I pulled into my neighborhood after a long day of work.”
The building had been abandoned since he moved into the neighborhood in 2017. It was the remnants of an abortion clinic, turned daycare center, turned 3,500 square feet of deserted possibility. A property management company with property close by eventually bought and leased the building in the summer of 2022.
“When this opportunity presented itself, I knew that it had to be comprehensive,” Brown said. “It wasn’t gonna be just like one type of art. It’s not Stephen Brown Art Center or 5th Child Art Center. This is Briarwood Arts Center. It’s not about one person, but it’s about the community.”
Brown aimed to fill a void in the local arts scene. Popular hangouts like The Flamingo, a collective space and venue in Fondren, had closed, and there weren’t many places around for people who were into the alternative arts and music culture.
“I wanted to create something where we own it, within the artist community, that nobody could just take from us or remove us from or anything like that,” he said. “I didn’t know how that was going to happen, I just knew that it needed to happen even if I wasn’t the person to do it.”
He secured the keys later that fall, and soon after hosted an open-house, gathering ideas for what community members wanted to see. That culminated into stacked programming, with a calendar flush with events such as line dancing classes, Kuumba (Swahili for creativity) Youth Night, GoodEDvice ACT Prep Club and Crochet Circle. Most of the events at the Briarwood Arts Center are free.
“The work that we’re doing here, we can find other ways to make money, but I don’t wanna make money on the backs of the community members,” he said. “I don’t wanna price them out of these enriching experiences, so that’s why the stuff that we do is free.”

Each room at the center is designed with the artist in mind. There’s the Craft Kitchen, where visitors can develop their crafting skills, practice using a Cricut machine and learn how to sew their own projects. In the Ubuntu room, dancers learn movement through music, and community members can brush up on their self-defense skills. There’s also Cole’s House II, a music lab, and The Branding Lab is complete with a green screen and backdrops for photography practice.
“The space is really designed for folks who are still trying to figure it out, who have the genuine curiosity about something that they’re like, ‘What if I don’t get it right? What if it’s not perfect?’ Well, come here and screw up,” he said. “Come here and make all your mistakes so that you can fine tune it and take it to a bigger, nicer, fancier venue down the line.”
Brown hopes that his persistence and dedication to creating safe spaces inspires others in Jackson to imagine what’s possible for their neighborhoods.
“What I want is for someone in Shady Oaks to be like, ‘Oh man, we got an abandoned building right here in our neighborhood too. Let’s put our money together and start the Shady Oaks Art Center.’ Or somebody in Alta Woods or in Virden Addition to say, ‘Hey man, we got this abandoned building. How about we start the Alta Woods Art Center?’”
Briarwood Arts Center will hold events for 601 JXN Day, which is an annual weekend long celebration of the city coordinated by Visit Jackson. Residents can participate in the Briarwood Unity 2K, as well as a community clean-up. The center will also host the Siegel Select Block Party, a service program where volunteers will collect donations and supplies for residents who stay in the hotel, which is right next to the arts center’s parking lot. 
“There’s no fee to register, but this is more about a demonstration of establishing that camaraderie and dignity for the Briarwood neighborhood,” he said. “Before Fondren was Fondren, somebody had to care enough. Before Belhaven was Belhaven, somebody had to be the squeaky wheel.”
Brown sees the space he cultivated as one that reaches across generations. He said he’s seen visitors at Briarwood Arts Center from ages 6 to 94.
“It’s not just about the technical skill of sewing a stitch, but they’re talking about history. They’re talking about legacy. They’re talking about family tradition and all that stuff is being passed down through the arts,” he said. “The arts are a vehicle to bring these people together. Arts have always been, not only a time capsule, but also a means of resistance. They’ve been a blueprint for resistance.”

This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

John Horhn far in the lead with nearly $200,000 in campaign expenditures since the beginning of the year.
The Democratic nominee for mayor reported raising $350,000 this year and holding less than $25,000 in cash-on-hand, according to campaign finance reports due Tuesday. 
Note: View a full list of reported contributions and expenditures from mayoral and council candidates and links to individual reports at the bottom of this story.
Second in spending in the mayor’s race was independent candidate and businessman Rodney DePriest with just over $72,000 in expenditures. He raised nearly $90,000 and had about $17,000 in cash-on-hand this week.
Horhn and DePriest face two other independents and a Republican, who combined have raised less than $5,000. Independent candidates Zach Servis and Lillie Stewart-Robinson reported spending about $1,600 and $1,300, respectively, while Republican candidate Kenny Gee did not file a report on time, but told Mississippi Today he’s spent $700 out-of-pocket.
A sixth mayoral candidate, conservative talk radio host and local businessman Kim Wade, who ran as an independent, recently announced he was dropping out of the race, though the city clerk told Mississippi Today that Wade did not file termination paperwork so his name will appear as normal on the ballot. He endorsed DePriest and did not file a campaign finance report on the deadline.
Another high-dollar race is the election for the Ward 1 council seat between incumbent Councilman Ashby Foote, who is running as an independent for the first time after being elected as a Republican, Democratic nominee Jasmine Barnes and independent candidate Grace Greene. The three have collectively spent nearly $90,000. 
Ward 7 Democratic candidate Kevin Parkinson far out-raised his independent opponent, Ron Aldridge, $45,000 compared to about $14,000, and Republican candidate Taylor Turcotte did not file a report, though the ad agency owner told Mississippi Today she has conducted her own advertising without donors and would file a report soon.
Two political action committees also filed reports outlining their participation in Jackson elections this year: MS PAC and Capitol Resources PAC, which contributed to incumbent Ward 4 Councilman Brian Grizzell ($1,000) and Horhn ($2,500), respectively. 
Both Horhn and DePriest reported that some of their largest donations, ranging from $5,000 to $10,000, came from LLCs. While Mississippi law limits donations from corporations at $1,000, LLCs that are taxed as sole proprietorships are not included in that cap. There are no limits on contributions from individuals or political committees.
Horhn’s largest donations include $12,500 from former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and $5,000 each from a law firm located in Tippah County, Hern Law Firm PLLC, two Madison-based professionals, insurance executive Brian Johnson and physician Billy Wayne Long, and Jackson architecture firm M3A Architecture PLLC.
DePriest’s largest donation was $10,000 from Clinton-based equipment rental company HIJACK LLC. He also received $5,000 donations from Barksdale and several Jackson-based professionals including real estate agents John Dinkins and Warren Speed, lawyer Cody Bailey, surgeon Matt Jones, physician James Clay Hayes, and an executive’s spouse Mollie Van Devender. He also received $6,000 from Raymond-based property management firm MDMW Investments and $5,000 from Texas resident Matt Wiggins.
As is common in local elections, several candidates did not submit reports by the deadline, including incumbent Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who told Mississippi Today he would file shortly, and his opponent Marques Jackson, who said he would file Thursday after checking his bank statements to ensure accurate reporting.

(Photo by Bill Oxford/ Getty Images)The legislative committee tasked with wading through the many proposals brought forward this session to address the problems with the state’s clean energy credit program is advancing a bill that critics say doesn’t go far enough. 
On Thursday night, the Maine Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee voted along party lines with the majority in favor of an amended version of LD 1777. The bill Democrats advanced to the full Legislature asks the Governor’s Energy Office to develop a successor program for front-of-the-meter net energy billing projects sometime next year. The Public Utilities Commission would need to approve the plan, but only if the benefits to ratepayers outweighs the costs.
Net energy billing is a utility program designed to encourage customers to install or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. It was expanded in 2019 so customers can use renewable energy generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. 
Front-of-the-meter projects include community solar projects and those included in the state’s current tariff rate program, which is used by nonresidential customers. If LD 1777 is enacted, front-of-the-meter projects would no longer be eligible to participate in net energy billing once the successor program is in place. 
“I hope that it will lead to the survival in a sustainable way and, perhaps, in a more economically just way for this really important set of programs and for the value that it has produced, as it certainly has,” said Rep. Sophie Warren (D-Scarborough), the bill’s sponsor. 
While the committee rejected other proposals, including those to repeal net energy billing entirely, it carried over some legislation such as LD 1936 that could serve as vehicles for further tweaks to the program in the next legislative session. 
As LD 1777 advances to the full Maine House of Representatives and Senate, proponents of solar energy fear these changes could harm the future of the industry.
Projected savings for ratepayers
During the committee discussion Thursday, Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said if passed the annual savings for ratepayers statewide over the next 16 years are estimated to be an average of $47 million from proposed changes to the tariff rate program and $20 million from changes to the kilowatt hour program. 
Currently, the kilowatt hour program is open to all customers and provides kilowatt hour credits on participating customers’ bills if they install renewable energy generators such as solar panels or join a community solar project, where customers receive a portion of a solar farm’s credits. The credits expire after 12 months. This program, in particular, has come under fire for providing generous incentives to solar farm developers that utility customers are helping pay for. 
LD 1777 creates a monthly charge for kilowatt hour projects starting January 2026 to offset the associated costs  currently passed on to ratepayers. 
There are 1,000 kilowatts in a megawatt and most community solar projects run between one and five megawatts. As of May 20, Maine has 300 community solar projects with a total capacity of just over 1,000 megawatts, according to the Governor’s Energy Office’s solar dashboard. 
The proposal outlines a charge of $4.10 per kilowatt of capacity for projects between three and five megawatts and $1.20 per kilowatt of capacity for projects between one and three megawatts. However, Warren said those may be adjusted to whatever number is necessary to achieve $20 million in ratepayer savings in the first year. 
The tariff rate program for nonresidential customers provides dollar credits for those who use their own projects or share in someone else’s. The Public Utilities Commission sets an annual rate for the credits, which also expire after 12 months, depending on the customer’s size and utility provider. 
However, Warren’s legislation establishes new, tiered tariff rates for certain projects starting January 2026. The new rates would vary depending on the project’s capacity. 
Republicans on the energy committee opposed the bill, with multiple of them saying it doesn’t go far enough to fix the problems net energy billing has created in the state. 
Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock) agreed, but voted in favor because “doing nothing would be completely irresponsible,” she said. However, she said that if more needs to be done to modify net energy billing in the future to support Maine people who are struggling to keep up with electricity bills, she vowed to “be loud” about it — whether she’s still in office or not. 
Similarly, Rep. Chris Kessler (D-South Portland) said he was voting in favor “with a heavy heart.” 
Admitting it may make him a “unicorn,” committee co-chair Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) said he has been pleased with net energy billing.
Though she was disappointed the committee couldn’t come to a unanimous vote, Rep. Valli Geiger (D-Rockland) said her fear would be that the legislation goes too far in potentially deterring solar.  She said climate change is an existential threat and renewable energy is the only path forward.
Maine’s clean energy sector has admitted net energy billing can be improved, but has cautioned lawmakers against retroactive changes to the program that could undermine investor confidence. Many of them were disappointed in the committee’s decision to advance LD 1777, which they feel includes “drastic” concessions for the solar industry, according to a news release after the vote. 
“The Legislature today chose to both harm participants retroactively and threaten the future of the industry,” said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. “While the program can certainly be improved, it should not occur at the expense of the people and businesses that invested in good faith for our clean energy future.”

(Submitted) TOPEKA — The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is digging into allegations against Comanche County personnel, and leaders of this rural community are finding it difficult to answer residents’ questions about the situation.
Residents in this rural south-central county have been reaching out to their officials to ask what happened after former county clerk Casey Huck resigned in March and KBI opened an investigation.
Until that investigation concludes, it’s unclear how the county may have been affected financially by potential wrongdoing, said Joe Moore, Comanche County Commission chairman.
“It’s a small community. Everybody knows everybody,” Moore said, adding that trust in a small-town is important. “There’s going to be long-term effects.”
“We’ve got some ideas because of what we don’t have, but we don’t know the length of it,” he added, referring to financial mismanagement that may have occurred. “One individual who has resigned was elected five years ago.”
Moore said he couldn’t comment about what happened regarding the credit cards or allegations of financial mismanagement and whether those were connected to Huck. He said the county turned over all records to KBI.
Even as they await information from KBI, county commissioners discovered in May that four county credit card bills hadn’t been paid for three months when the issuing bank closed the accounts, commission minutes said.
In a special meeting May 9, county commissioners discussed the four closed credit cards and whether they could get those accounts reopened. The county owed $37,668.85 on the cards, and the commission voted to pay the total amount owed. The cards in question were used by county employees, including for county commissioners, the county clerk’s office and one in Huck’s name.
Commissioners changed some technical processes in May, such as revamping credit card use rules for county employees.
“We changed the limits on our credit cards,” Moore said. “We’re going to check the balance on every credit card every two weeks when we have our meeting.”
Moore said the county also is setting up processes that confirm charges that are made on the credit cards and that records are accurate.
“We’re not sure how deep this thing is yet, either,” he said. “Until we know what actually happened, it’s hard to set changes.”
Moore said he’s concerned about the county’s credit rating, calling potential impacts to it “tough to fix.”
Organizations like Fitch and S&P Global issue credit ratings for government entities. A  lower credit rating can increase interest rates on borrowed money and affect bonds that are issued.
KBI spokesman Dustin Wallace confirmed the investigation is ongoing. Huck did not respond to a request for a comment. In a previous story, she told the Reflector that she “made a mistake.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Comanche-County-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 10:01:57.321841

It didn’t involve picket signs, marches or sweeping legislative change. It was a picnic. In a park. With a rainbow flag fluttering from a folding table, a handful of brave souls gathered near the Snake River to celebrate who they were — out loud — for the first time in their rural town.
That picnic was the beginning of East Central Minnesota Pride. And, unbeknownst to many at the time, it was the first rural LGBTQ Pride event in the United States.
This June, Pine City — population 4,200 and growing — will celebrate the 20th anniversary of that event. In doing so, we celebrate more than a milestone. We honor the legacy of a place that chose community over conformity, compassion over silence, and inclusion over fear.
The story of rural Pride didn’t begin in a metro center with corporate floats or glitter bombs. It started in a town known more for fishing derbies and Friday fish fries than for progressive firsts. 
Back in 2005, when rural queerness was still mostly whispered or erased, a small group of LGBTQ locals and allies chose to be visible. Their gathering was met with curiosity, quiet resistance, and eventually, something even more powerful: acceptance.
In fact, the event drew enough attention that by 2007, the Star Tribune ran a headline that captured both the controversy and the charm of it all: “Hot-button issues with potato salad.” The picnic may have seemed simple on the surface, but it challenged deeply held assumptions about who belongs in rural spaces — and how loudly they’re allowed to exist.
Over time, East Central Minnesota Pride became an anchor — both for LGBTQ residents, and for the whole region. Today, the event features live music, drag performances, speakers and families pushing strollers past booths staffed by churches, businesses and nonprofits. The small town where it began now hosts crowd sizes that crack the thousand mark each year, including people from towns that still don’t have a Pride of their own.
What Pine City proved is that Pride doesn’t require a skyline. It requires courage. And community. And a willingness to believe that small towns can be big-hearted.
Don Quaintance, one of the event’s founding members, put it best: “Small-town Pride events are the ones that create the change. It’s easy to blend in with 500,000 of your friends at the Twin Cities Pride festival — and another to be one of 500 in Pine City. That takes a good deal of courage.”
In many ways, Pine City’s embrace of Pride helped shape its evolution. Last year, the town elected Minnesota’s only openly gay mayor, Kent Bombard — a lifelong resident who volunteered for the other big event in town, the Pine County Fair — long before running for office. The city continues to grow, becoming more diverse, inclusive and welcoming with each passing year.
Of course, it hasn’t always been easy. There have been critics, letters to the editor, even threats. But each year the rainbow returns to the town square at Robinson Park, each year families attend together, and each year more younger people see a future for themselves here — without needing to leave home to live authentically.
That matters. Because for every rural LGBTQ person who finds support in their hometown, we chip away at the idea that queerness belongs only in cities. We push back against the false choice between authenticity and belonging. And we remind the world that rural America is not a monolith.
As someone who grew up in Pine City and has watched this transformation firsthand, I can tell you that the real success of rural Pride isn’t measured in crowd size or media mentions. It’s measured in conversations between neighbors. In rainbow stickers on truck bumpers. In the kid who doesn’t flinch before saying “my boyfriend” at Walmart. That’s where the revolution lives.
There are now more than 20 rural and small-town Pride celebrations across Minnesota, and dozens more nationally. Some have grown big and bold; others remain intimate. All of them owe a quiet debt to Pine City.
As we gather again on June 7 to celebrate 20 years of rural Pride, we do so with gratitude — for the founders who risked being seen, for the allies who showed up, and for the small-town queers who keep choosing visibility.
Because visibility in rural America is powerful. It’s political. And it’s deeply personal.
Pride in Pine City may have started as a picnic, but it became a proclamation: We are here. We’ve been your neighbors. And we’re not going anywhere.

Vaccination rates for Alaska children have declined in recent years, the state reports. (Maryland Executive Office of the Governor photo)Alaska’s rates for childhood vaccinations are well below the national average, and the percentage of kindergarteners who had received all recommended vaccines was the lowest last year since at least 2017, according to a new report from the state Department of Health.
Only 54% of kindergarteners in the state had received all of their recommended vaccinations in 2024, according to a bulletin issued by the department’s epidemiology section. That compares to a national rate of about 93%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
There are six recommended vaccines for severe illnesses for kindergarten-age children, and Alaska rates fall below the national average for all six, including polio and chickenpox. For the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly called MMR, only 76% of Alaska kindergarteners in 2024 had completed the recommended two-dose series, the bulletin said. That compares to a 93% national rate for the MMR vaccine, said the bulletin, which documented a downward drift in vaccination rates over recent years.
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus, causing fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes, and can cause serious illness and death. Symptoms usually appear 7 to 14 days after infection. 
The bulletin has a warning: “Declining measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates in Alaska could jeopardize the health of Alaskans.”
Information about Alaska’s lagging childhood vaccination rates comes at a critical time.
Anchorage health officials on May 22 reported the city’s first case of measles in several years. The patient was an unvaccinated child, municipal officials said. 
The Anchorage case follows two reported earlier in the year on the Kenai Peninsula, one an adult who had traveled internationally and one a minor, according to the Department of Health.
Unlike the adult Kenai Peninsula case, the sickened Anchorage child had not traveled, said Dr. George Conway, the municipality’s chief medical officer. The child had not had contact with anyone who showed signs of having measles, such as skin rashes, so the source of exposure remains unclear, he said.
But the infected child did spend time at numerous public spaces in Anchorage before being diagnosed on May 21, including a trampoline park and the local YMCA, officials said.
No related measles infections have been reported in Anchorage as of Thursday since this month’s single diagnosis was revealed.

	Though measles was declared to have been eliminated in the United States in 2000, thanks to the vaccine, the proclamation may have been premature.
Currently, there are large outbreaks elsewhere in the nation, particularly in Texas and neighboring states. There were 1,046 cases and three measles deaths reported nationally as of May 22, according to the CDC. Almost all the cases have been among unvaccinated people, the CDC said.
Conway said the national situation makes the Anchorage case unsurprising. Reduced rates of vaccination around the nation and in Alaska have set up conditions for outbreaks, he said.
“We have a vulnerability and that’s manifesting itself in our susceptibility to cases,” he said. “Alaska is certainly no shining star as far as vaccination rates, but we’re not the worst off, either.”
There are a few states, such as Idaho, that have vaccination rates for kindergarteners that are below Alaska’s rates, according to the CDC. But most states have higher rates for all childhood vaccines.
Conway, who has four decades of experience working in public health, used two words to describe the downward trend in childhood vaccinations: “discouraging” and “disappointing.”
Much of that is the result of misinformation and confusion spread on the internet, including a debunked theory that vaccines cause autism among children, he said. That intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.
“It’s a much harder environment in which to give advice,” he said.
When it comes to measles, many in the public may underestimate the danger, he added..
“The thing about measles that a lot of people may not understand is it is one of possibly the most readily transmissible respiratory viruses, and it can cause serious illness and deaths,” he said.
The state Department of Health has a similar warning message on its website. “Measles isn’t just a little rash. It’s a highly contagious viral respiratory illness that can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children. Each year around the world, an estimated 10 million people get measles, and about 110,000 of them die from it,” the department warns.

	Use of the measles vaccine began in the 1960s. Conway said it is credited with saving 93 million lives worldwide since then.
Health officials hope the news about the Anchorage child who contracted measles – now recovering well – will motivate residents to ensure that they and their children are vaccinated against that and other diseases, Conway said.
However, Anchorage health officials have not noticed any rush toward vaccination yet, he said.
Sarah Aho, the Department of Health’s immunization program manager, said Alaska’s low rate of childhood vaccination is “a multi-faceted situation” that needs a broad-based response.
Disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were among them, she said by email.
“We saw fewer children vaccinated early in the COVID-pandemic, initially due to fewer kids attending their well-child visits for routine vaccinations in 2020. Many of those kids are now in kindergarten and may have not gotten up-to-date on their routine immunizations,” she said.
A previous report, issued in 2023, also suggested that COVID-related disruptions have resulted in lower vaccination coverage, though for younger children.
Aho, like Conway, also cited bad information leading to mistrust of health science as a factor in reduced vaccination rates. The “increasing prevalence of misinformation might impact vaccine confidence,” she said by email.
Additionally, there are logistical complications in some areas of Alaska, Aho said. “Access to vaccines is a challenge in some communities, further exacerbating barriers of time and potential vaccine availability,” she said.
To address those issues, health officials are developing an Alaska Immunization Coalition and increasing educational efforts, including focused use of postcard reminders, she said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/stkw5017-1-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 12:18:09.408093

Mike Kehoe expanding extracurricular opportunities for homeschool students.
The legislation, which has been filed every year in Missouri since 2014, will require public schools to allow homeschooled students in the area to try out for sports teams and other activities beginning in August.
Throughout much of the bill’s history, it couldn’t even get a committee hearing. By 2023, the proposal managed to barely pass a Senate committee in a 5-4 vote, with three Democrats and one Republican opposed.
Things changed in February, when it cleared the Senate unanimously — a rarity for the chamber. But then the House made changes to the bill, like prohibiting background checks of homeschooling families that receive money through a private school tax credit program. 
That change drew the ire of some senators and put the bill’s chances in jeopardy. But ultimately, the two chambers worked out a compromise and only three senators ended up voting no.

The legislation has had 10 sponsors over the years. Each points to different reasons the bill finally made it to the governor’s desk this legislative session, such as unrelenting dedication from homeschooling families and the fervor of this year’s sponsor, state Sen. Ben Brown.
Brown, a Republican from Washington, told The Independent that “the stars were aligned” for the bill to pass this year.
“It took a tremendous amount of work, both in the legislature with support from leadership and from the grassroots support,” he said. “Those were all key factors that just culminated and finally, after more than a decade, ensured that these kids get these opportunities.”
State Rep. Josh Hurlbert, a Smithville Republican who sponsored the legislation from 2021 to 2024, gave kudos to homeschooling families that came to Jefferson City to support the legislation.
“Legislators come and go,” he said. “But it is the families that have been the constant and saw it through.”
Hurlbert was a homeschooled student who played soccer in a league of students like him. He sponsored the bill thinking of students in rural areas who don’t have access to homeschool leagues, and his young, home-educated children who play in recreational teams with kids educated both in and outside the public school system.
His bill passed committee in 2021 and 2022 after families with home-educated children came to testify in favor of the legislation. Some families who submitted testimony in 2021 returned to push for the bill this year.
“We have had so many homeschool families and kids come over through the years to testify and tell their side of the story,” Hurlbert said. “They really made an impact.”
The bill’s journey in Missouri began in 2014, when it was first introduced by then-state Rep. Eiljah Haahr.
Haahr, a Springfield Republican and homeschool student who went on to become speaker of the Missouri House, participated in a homeschool sports league as a student.
“When I got in the legislature, I was like, ‘I don’t want kids to be the same way as me, where they want to participate in sports and they don’t have an opportunity to do so,’” he told The Independent.
The greatest opposition in 2014 came from the Missouri State High School Activities Association, or MSHSAA, which regulates extracurricular activities and sports in public schools.
Former state Rep. Kirk Mathews, a Republican from Pacific, picked up the bill after Haahr in 2016. It was not heard in committee that year, and Mathews told The Independent that MSHSAA was a big reason.
“(MSHSAA) had enough influence with leadership to have a bill not get advanced through the process,” he said.
The legislation continued to languish in 2017, sponsored by former state Rep. Don Rone, a Portageville Republican. He told The Independent that leadership continued to overlook the bill.
“We had some problems back then,” he said, “and (the bill) just didn’t get put on the front burners.”
New leadership in both chambers this year showed support for the bill that Brown “had never seen before.”
Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican from Shelbina, sponsored the bill in 2022. And current leaders in the House told Brown they liked the legislation, a departure from the resistance he said he faced from the House’s former speaker, Dean Plocher.
Prior to Plocher’s term as speaker, the bill largely moved only in the House. But the Senate version has seen the most activity in the past two years.
“The narrative had kind of flipped over the years,” Hurlbert said. “The past couple of years, the hardest part was the House.”
Other things have changed as well. State lawmakers have been increasingly interested in alternatives to public education, passing and expanding a tax-credit scholarship system benefiting private schools.
“The entire climate towards public education has changed in Missouri over the last couple of years,” Mathews said. “With school choice being looked upon more favorably.”
MSHSAA has been largely quiet about the legislation, saying it would cause “substantial changes” in a press release but omitting details.
The legislation awaits Kehoe’s decision on whether to sign it or veto it. If he doesn’t take action by July 15, the bill is automatically approved.
“We had days where 50 people showed up from different homeschool families around the state of Missouri,” Brown said. “To be able to get this done for them, it was probably the most rewarding moment that I’ve had in my time (in the Senate).”

Last week the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives advanced a budget package gutting Medicaid spending by $700 billion in order to help offset the cost of extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.
In addition to California potentially losing as much as $20 billion a year and 217,000 jobs because of this, millions of low-income Californians on Medi-Cal — the state’s version of Medicaid — could lose coverage due to the bill’s proposed proof-of-work-hours requirement.
As CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra explains, about 15 million Californians are on Medi-Cal, and roughly 29% of Medi-Cal recipients can’t work because of caregiving responsibilities, school, a disability or other exemption. The bill would require certain adults to report work hours, which could lead to, by some estimates, between 1.2 million and 3.5 million Californians losing coverage.
In an interview with ABC’s Bakersfield affiliate, GOP Rep. David Valadao, who represents parts of San Joaquin Valley, said the average person “who is working really hard” thinks the work requirements are “the right thing to do.”

Valadao: “For those who are able-bodied with no dependents and you choose not to try to make that effort to go get a job … yeah you’re probably going to be affected by this.”

But health policy researchers and advocates point to New Hampshire and Arkansas — two states that once imposed work requirements. Instead of increasing employment, the mandates left thousands of eligible people without health insurance within months. Both states have since eliminated the policies. 

Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy officer at Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit health advocacy organization: “The program saves money through mistakes. And that’s not a good way to run social insurance or to run policy.”

All 43 California Democrats opposed the bill, while all nine GOP members — who represent a total of 2.5 million Medi-Cal enrollees — voted for it. The bill is now before the Senate and as currently drafted, work requirements would begin Dec. 31, 2026.

Status update on Trump’s tariffs: It’s complicated

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
A federal trade court ruled the sweeping tariffs unlawful Wednesday, but that ruling was paused Thursday pending the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s consideration of the Trump administration’s appeal. A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., also issued a similar ruling Thursday in a lawsuit brought by two small businesses.

Kush Desai, White House spokesperson, in an email: “It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.” 

The administration has said trade deficits constitute an emergency and invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify its tariffs.
The tariffs have had a big effect on California port activity, and remain in effect until the appeals court makes a decision on the lawsuit. Twelve states led by Oregon and five businesses brought on the lawsuit, which is similar to a separate lawsuit filed by California. It’s unclear how quickly the appeals court will act. 

Brian Peck, international business law expert at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law: “I would hope (the appeals court is) not deaf, blind and dumb to what’s going on with businesses.”

Peck also suspects the case will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court.
For businesses, the legal wrangling means continued unpredictability, said Darlene Chiu-Bryant, executive director of GlobalSF, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps facilitate trade, especially with Asia.



Trump continues assault on DEI, education

On Tuesday Trump posted on social media that he would withhold “large scale” federal funding from California for allowing high school transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports. But that’s not the only federal action Trump is threatening against California LGBTQ+ students, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
To reduce federal spending, the president has proposed cutting more than $10 billion from the U.S. Department of Education, and threatened to pull funding from any school across the U.S. that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
Under this directive, Trump only called out one program by name: San Diego Community College District’s LGBTQ+ pride centers. In 2023 the district’s four community colleges received over $225,000 in federal grants to support spaces and programs for LGBTQ+ students. But the money supports “initiatives unrelated to students or institutional reforms,” according to Trump’s budget proposal.
To avoid possible clawbacks, the district’s chancellor said the centers are planning to spend down the federal money “as quickly as we can.” Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs, who represents parts of San Diego and requested the grants, said Trump is “attacking the ideals that higher education is founded on, like free speech.”

Jacobs: “LGBTQ+ kids and especially trans kids are Republicans’ favorite scapegoat.”

A new district attorney is withdrawing from that effort.,"In summary
Evidence of racial bias in jury selection led Alameda County to review dozens of death penalty cases. A new district attorney is withdrawing from that effort.


Alameda County’s new district attorney is rejecting her predecessor’s recommendations to resentence people on death row — recommendations triggered by a historic review of systemic prosecutorial misconduct.
Records obtained by CalMatters show at least four cases in which District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson has moved to withdraw resentencing motions filed under Pamela Price, who was recalled from office in November. 
Price launched the review roughly one year ago, after U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria mandated that her office investigate 35 death penalty cases for prosecutorial misconduct dating back to the 1980s. 
His order cited “strong evidence that, in prior decades, prosecutors from the office were engaged in a pattern of serious misconduct, automatically excluding Jewish and African American jurors in death penalty cases.”
Price ultimately recommended resentencing 30 people, the majority people of color, after finding that their constitutional rights had been violated. Of those, 20 people have had their day in court and were resentenced to terms less than death under Alameda County Superior Court Judge Thomas Stevens. 
But that effort came to a halt when Price was ousted. Her resentencing team was disbanded, according to court records and interviews with former staffers. And the 10 resentencing recommendations awaiting a ruling were reassigned to Alameda County Superior Court Judge Armando Pastran, a former prosecutor.
The Alameda County Board of Supervisors appointed Jones Dickson, a former judge, to her post in February. Her office began filing motions to withdraw recommendations less than two months later, contending that Price and her team made flawed legal arguments and failed to sufficiently contact victims and their family members. 
The “motion is based on a substantive reevaluation of the facts of the case, legal analysis…consideration of petitioner’s prior crimes, and new information about the victims’ wishes,” wrote deputy district attorney Emily Tienken in one of the filings. 
The decision to reverse course signals one of the first major policy changes the office has adopted since Price’s departure. 
“It’s absolutely disgraceful,” said Michael Collins, senior director at Color of Change, a racial justice organization that called on the Attorney General’s Office to support Price’s review and launch its own investigation. “It’s scandalous that this has happened and now they’re trying to bury the cases. The people whose lives were destroyed — the people who were given unconstitutional trials are not getting any indemnification.”
In an interview with CalMatters, Price said her office was looking to achieve justice and it was not driven by politics.
“It was very disturbing,” said Price. “If this is the practice and you’re doing it in these types of cases, what’s to say you’re not doing it in other types of cases as well? So our concern was that we had a huge task ahead of us.”

The Alameda County District Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for an interview for  this story. At a press conference marking her first 100 days in office, Jones Dickson on Thursday did not directly answer a question about her stance on the death penalty cases.
“I don’t have a plan to specifically review any death penalty cases that are pending,” she said. “We are already in the midst of doing that. It looks like the prior administration started that process and so there are cases that are still pending that we’re reviewing and evaluating and filing motions on and doing the things that lawyers do. But I don’t have a policy at this point regarding choosing cases to pull for resentencing.” 
Jonathan Raven, an executive at the California District Attorneys Association, said not every district attorney is going to agree on a specific case.
“Any district attorney is always going to review policies and practices, and review the decisions of the prior district attorney, which I think is what the voters would want – or certainly, the board of supervisors,” he said.
Disparities in death penalty sentences
Decades of research has documented racial bias in the application of the death penalty. In a brief submitted to the California Supreme Court challenging the administration of the state’s death penalty scheme, legal advocacy organizations wrote that Black and Latino defendants are roughly six to nine times more likely to be sentenced to death than all other defendants. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom cited that legacy when he suspended the death penalty in California six years ago. But voters have consistently upheld the death penalty as a policy, and almost 600 people incarcerated in state prisons have been sentenced to death.
Allegations of racially discriminatory jury selection practices in Alameda County were first raised in 2005 by a former prosecutor in a sworn declaration. Roughly 20 years later, Price announced that her office had uncovered evidence of those violations. 
Jury selection notes disclosed by Price’s office revealed that past Alameda County prosecutors had been illegally tracking and striking potential jurors on the basis of race and religion for decades. 
In one instance, prosecutors described a prospective Black female juror as a “Short, Fat, Troll.” Prosecutors wrote of another prospective juror, “I liked him better than any other Jew but no way.”
Those findings served as the basis for Judge Chhabria’s order and quickly became priority for Price’s team, which had already been resentencing many other types of cases. According to Price and former staffers, the office assembled a team of victim witness advocates who contacted all of the survivors they were able to identify. 
Appeal reached California Supreme Court
The team spent months reviewing cases, including the conviction of Grayland Winbush. Winbush, a Black man, was sentenced to death in 2003 following the murder of Erika Beeson during a robbery. He was 19 at the time of the crime. In court filings, attorneys for Winbush argued that his constitutional rights were violated when prosecutors removed all Black prospective jurors and relied on racial stereotypes to characterize him as a superpredator. 
In January, Price’s office recommended that he be resentenced to 30 years to life, acknowledging that his case had “become a reference point in discussions of jury selection misconduct.” In return, Winbush agreed that he would no longer continue appealing his sentence. But roughly three months later, Jones Dickson withdrew the original recommendation “based on carefully considered victim impact and up-to-date legal analysis.” 
Attorneys for Winbush held that the office has no factual or legal ground to revoke its recommendation, maintaining that “withdrawing a recommendation on a whim or based on ‘a change in the political winds’” is not valid.
The motion “perpetuates, rather than confronts and remedies, the widespread race-based misconduct that led a federal judge to direct the office to review its death penalty cases,” wrote appellate defense attorney Rebecca Jones. “The original resentencing petition filed by the (Alameda County District Attorney’s Office) is a piece of its attempt to redress systemic bias reflected by the jury selection in Mr. Winbush’s case.”
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Pastran will decide whether to grant Jones Dickson’s revocation of Winbush’s resentencing recommendation in the months ahead. 
In another case, Jones Dickson is pulling the resentencing recommendation for Giles Albert Nadey, who was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000 for murdering a young woman. 
The case came up for argument in the California Supreme Court last year, around the same time that Price’s office had surfaced evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, but did not consider that evidence and ultimately upheld the death sentence.
In a divided opinion, the court looked at a prosecutor’s decision to dismiss five of six Black women from Nadey’s jury pool and determined the deputy district attorney had valid reasons to strike them, such as his perceptions of their political leanings. 
“We conclude in each instance the prosecutor’s reasons were inherently plausible and
supported,” the court ruled in a 5-2 decision, citing evidence from jury questionnaires and the prosecutor’s questioning of the stricken jurors.
In a dissent, Justice Goodwin Liu referred to the federal court ruling that directed Price to review death penalty cases. The “decision is particularly jarring given what has come to light in federal court regarding capital jury selection in Alameda County around the time that Nadey was tried,” Liu wrote.

A proposal in Congress would require some adults to document 80 hours a month of work or school. Experts say the red tape and paperwork is so cumbersome that even people who work will lose their health insurance.



If Congress moves forward with a controversial proposal to require people to report work hours to keep Medicaid, more than a million of California’s poorest residents could lose their health insurance.
The budget bill that the U.S. House advanced last week includes a requirement that certain adults — largely those under 65 without children or a disability — meet work reporting rules. In California, about a third of them could lose their health coverage, according to an analysis by the research group Urban Institute. Based on 2026 enrollment projections, that’s between 1.2 and 1.4 million Californians.
As Congress looks at Medicaid for ways to help offset the cost of extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, imposing work requirements has increasingly been deemed as one of the most feasible and significant cost-savings actions. House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS that work requirements have a “moral component” and that people who don’t work are “defrauding the system.”
But health policy researchers and advocates point to New Hampshire and Arkansas, where state-imposed work requirements failed in recent years. Their policies didn’t actually boost employment; they did, however, leave thousands of eligible people without health insurance within a matter of months. Both states have since canceled their work policies. Georgia is the only state that currently has work requirements. 
Nationwide and in California, about two-thirds of Medicaid enrollees work, according to the health research firm KFF. Another 29% care for children, attend school or have a disability that would exempt them. But health advocates say the additional red tape to prove employment could be so cumbersome that many eligible people would fall out of the health insurance program.


“You might say you’re combating waste, fraud and abuse,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit health advocacy organization that funds policy research.  But “the way you’re going to save money is by people inadvertently or accidentally losing their coverage. The program saves money through mistakes. And that’s not a good way to run social insurance or to run policy.”
Medi-Cal — the California version of Medicaid — provides health insurance to almost 15 million people.
Diana Alfaro, associate executive director of Central City Neighborhood Partners, a nonprofit that helps people enroll in public benefits and services, says some of her low-income clients in Los Angeles who rely on Medi-Cal are employed — but not always in “typical” paying jobs. They are housekeepers, gardeners, construction workers and others who don’t have a regular paycheck or a single employer.

So far, it’s unclear exactly what documentation enrollees would need to show if a work requirement is enacted. But Alfaro is concerned that it could be especially challenging for people whose schedules fluctuate or who are paid in cash and don’t receive a pay stub that shows their hours worked. Some enrollees use a copy of their taxes, a letter from their employer or in some cases self-attestation to verify income eligibility when first applying for Medi-Cal. 
“Some of them are doing those jobs of gardening or being a nanny or a housekeeper, and so they’re already going to have a hard time getting a letter that certifies the amount of hours that they’re doing if this were to pass,” Alfaro said.
House proposal requires 80 hours a month of work or school
The work requirement proposal is part of President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” which the U.S. House passed last week and is now in the hands of the Senate. All nine of California’s House Republicans voted in favor of the bill, while all Democrats voted against it. 
The current version requires certain adults to log at least 80 hours a month of “community engagement,” which could be employment, school or volunteer work.  As proposed, the rule would pertain specifically to adults ages 19 to 64 who qualify for Medicaid as part of an expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Pregnant women, parents and caregivers of young children, and people with mental and physical disabilities would be exempt. 
Rep. David Valadao, a California Republican who represents portions of the San Joaquin Valley that have some of the highest Medicaid enrollment, told ABC’s Bakersfield affiliate that work requirements are a fair ask. 
“For those who are able-bodied with no dependents and you choose not to try to make that effort to go get a job, go to school or volunteer, do something in your community, yeah you’re probably going to be affected by this, but the average person who is working really hard to provide for their family thinks that’s the right thing to do,” Valadao said.
But Rep. Laura Friedman, a California Democrat representing Los Angeles, said it is the responsibility of the government to help people stay safe and healthy, but work requirements would do the opposite. 
“They want to make it so hard for you and your family to access care with these onerous work requirements that you say ‘I’m not even going to bother, I’ll just try not to get sick,’” Friedman said during a press conference this week. 
Friedman said the proposed cuts and requirements in the House bill would lead to more uncompensated care costs for clinics and hospitals, which ultimately could lead to reduced services for entire communities.

As currently drafted in the House bill, work requirements would kick in on Dec. 31, 2026. States would have the option to start earlier.
In addition to the work rules, the House budget bill proposes several other changes, including requiring these enrollees to verify their income every six months, rather than once a year. A separate measure seeks to financially penalize states that offer non-emergency Medicaid coverage to undocumented people, even if it’s with state-only funds, as California does. And less federal funding may force states to reduce benefits or enrollment.
The federal proposals are on top of changes that Gov. Gavin Newsom is already eyeing that could also force people to lose their health insurance. In his most recent budget proposal, Newsom proposed benefit reductions, a premium charge and enrollment freezes for undocumented residents as the state deals with a projected $12 billion shortfall.
All of the proposals at the federal and state level are bound to result in confusion and disruption for patients, Alfaro said. 
“Last year we were doing a bunch of promotion around how easier it is to get health insurance,” she said. “And it seems like now we’re going a step backwards.”
The Arkansas and New Hampshire experience
Currently about 5 million Californians with Medi-Cal are eligible because of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. The 2010 health law allowed states  to add adults without children or a disability to their rolls. It’s this group of enrollees that would be subject to the work requirements. 
The Urban Institute’s estimate of more than a million of them losing coverage in 2026 is based on multiple factors, including trends and experiences observed in Arkansas and New Hampshire.
In 2018, Arkansas became the first state to implement work rules as a condition for Medicaid coverage. The rule applied to adults ages 30 to 49 who had to show 80 hours of work a month. Within six months, 18,000 adults had lost their coverage. In 2019, a federal judge struck down the state’s work requirement.
State lawmakers in New Hampshire said they’d do a better job than Arkansas in rolling out their own 2019 work requirement, but they faced similar challenges. The state had a difficult time reaching enrollees and notifying them about the changes, news reports at the time show. On track to lose thousands of people more than anticipated, the state suspended its rule.
“Based on the experience of other states, even if you spend a ton of energy on outreach, a lot of people just don’t realize what they have to do,” said Nari Rhee, director of the Retirement Security Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center. “People have a bunch of questions: ‘Am I exempt? What do I have to do?’
“Even in New Hampshire, where they thought they were being gentle about the rollout, people had a hard time getting through (phone lines) to ask questions,” Rhee said. “So you can expect a pretty large percentage of people who could meet the requirements just fine, basically falling through the cracks and losing coverage because they just didn’t know or couldn’t get the information they needed.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052825_WorkRequirements_JC_CM_23.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

San Diego’s community college district finds itself directly in Trump’s crosshairs: Its “pride centers” were the only items called out by name in the administration’s plan to slash more than $10 billion of federal spending on education.


Over 2,500 miles from Washington D.C., in a windowless meeting room at a San Diego community college, President Donald Trump’s fight with higher education is playing out. 
“This presidential thing, we will not let that happen here at Mesa College,” said Lucio Lira, the coordinator at the college’s “pride center,” as an audience of over 50 students, faculty and staff applauded loudly. 
That “thing” is a budget cut. President Trump is proposing to cut more than $10 billion from the US Department of Education for the 2026 fiscal year. For each national program he wants to cut, the justification is usually general, pointing to the need to shrink the role of the federal government or to undermine “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion efforts) and “woke ideology.” He singles out just one program by name: San Diego Community College District’s LGBTQ+ pride centers.
In California, more than half of all undergraduates attend community colleges, but unlike Ivy League institutions and major research universities, such as UCLA, community colleges have largely avoided Trump’s spending cuts and ire — so far. But they’re bracing for changes to come. 
In 2023, each of San Diego’s four community colleges received over $225,000 through a federal grant to support spaces and programs for their LGBTQ+ students. That money is supporting “initiatives unrelated to students or institutional reforms,” Trump’s budget proposal says. 
Those federal dollars helped Lira transform Mesa College’s meeting room into a banquet hall with tables, decorations and catering for a  “Lavender Celebration.” At this event, the college honored its LGBTQ+ graduates by offering each a pride-themed stole — or, as Lira says, a “sash” — to wear at commencement. Technically, any student can participate in the Lavender Celebration  and receive a stole because California’s Proposition 209, in effect since voters approved it nearly three decades ago, bans giving “preferential treatment” to students based on race or sex. 
After Lira’s speech, the college president, the district’s chancellor and one of the district’s board members spoke to the graduates, criticizing the Trump administration for singling out these San Diego pride centers, and for its February letter to colleges, which threatened to pull federal funding from any school that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion. Colleges across the country have cancelled or rebranded graduation events for LGBTQ+ students out of concern that these events could also violate the administration’s order.
San Diego Community College District Chancellor Gregory Smith said the pride centers are planning to spend down the federal money “as quickly as we can so it isn’t pulled back.” Meanwhile, Trump’s budget proposal requires Congressional approval, which can take months.
‘Republicans’ favorite scapegoat.’
Lira and his staff set up the meeting room for the celebration, draping each table in a lavender cloth and hanging streamers from the ceiling. Together with the balloons and the catering, including pan dulce with lavender-colored crusts, the event cost about $3,000, he said, all of it supported by federal funds.

The grants to San Diego’s pride centers were an earmark, requested by local Democratic US Rep. Sara Jacobs. A co-chair of the “Transgender Equality Task Force” in the House, Jacobs said Trump’s proposed cuts to San Diego’s pride centers have little to do with this particular grant. 
“He wants to be able to control what (colleges) teach, who they admit and hire, what areas of study they can follow. He wants us to be talking about LGBTQ+ kids instead of how he’s attacking the ideals that higher education is founded on, like free speech,” she said. “LGBTQ+ kids and especially trans kids are Republicans’ favorite scapegoat.”
San Diego’s LGBTQ+ center isn’t the only cited reason for cutting the roughly $200 million federal program where the earmark came from, the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education. Trump’s budget offers another, broader justification too, saying colleges and states, not the federal government, “should be responsible for funding institutional reforms and innovative programs.  These additional resources have allowed colleges and universities to fund ideologies instead of students, while still raising tuition costs.” 
Trump targets one other community college grant in California as justification for cutting another, roughly $100 million federal program, although without naming the college. “It is not the responsibility of Federal taxpayers to support a new ‘Guided Pathways Village, expanding the current Learning Communities and creating a new Ethnic and Pride Inclusion Center for historically underserved students, including LGBTQ+ students,’” the budget proposal says. The language about the “Guided Pathways Village” directly matches a 2021 press release about a $2.25 million federal grant to De Anza College in Cupertino. 
Already, his administration has slashed research funding to professors who study LGBTQ issues and prevented federally funded programs from recognizing non-binary or gender nonconforming students.  
On Tuesday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, threatening to withhold “large scale Federal Funding” from California because of one transgender athlete. 
Snacks and support at the LGBTQ+ center
When the pride center isn’t hosting events, it’s a hang-out space, where students stop by to grab a snack, study, and talk with Lira, who is a counselor. Outside the center is a rack of free clothes for students who are transitioning their gender. 
“Like everyone else I come here most days for the food,” said student Daniella Abbott with a laugh. “I honestly met most of my friends here.” She said she has seen the pride center grow in popularity since it first opened in February 2023. Now Lira said over 30 students come to the center each day. 
Christopher Delgado is also a regular. “When I first came here, I was about to be homeless,” he said. Lira recommended he enroll in a counseling course that’s specifically targeted to LGBTQ+ students, which changed his life, he said. “I was able to lift myself out of a bad place.” He is set to graduate next year but came to the Lavender Celebration to cheer on his friends. 
Delgado identifies as gay while others around him say they’re trans, queer, pansexual or bisexual. Some aren’t out to their families or say their parents aren’t supportive.
After all the speeches, Lira returned to the podium, where he announced graduates’ names and placed stoles around their necks. The students transferring to four-year universities announced their plans, and each posed for a photo with the college president and district chancellor.
Abbott was the first name called. Standing at the podium next to Lira, she announced that she’s headed to UCLA in the fall, though it isn’t technically true – at least not yet. “I got waitlisted,” she told CalMatters with a laugh. “It’s happening. They just don’t know it yet.”
Her back-up, UC San Diego, already admitted her and she said it offered a generous financial aid package — a requirement for her.

As part of the federal earmark, Mesa College gave out $500 scholarships to low-income LGBTQ+ students involved in the pride center, and Abbott was one of the many recipients. 
“When I found out I got the scholarship, I was like ‘Oh great, I can finally get lunch,” she said. It was a joke, she later clarified, but there’s a kernel of truth: Although she lives at home with her parents, Abbott is responsible for most of her living costs, such as gas and food. She received around $8,400 in federal financial aid in the past academic year, as well as $4,000 in state aid.
Many of California’s roughly 2 million community college students are low-income — some are even homeless — and like Abbott, they rely on federal aid  to cover daily expenses. In his budget, Trump proposes ending long-standing programs that offer academic counseling and cash to low-income students who are the first generation in their families to attend college. The Education Department has already moved to exclude students without legal status from accessing that program. 
Earlier this year, the advocacy association for California’s community college presidents and trustees asked the state to help offset the impact of federal budget cuts, but the state has a projected budget deficit, and Gov. Gavin Newsom’s budget proposals don’t mention the association’s request. 
Funded or not, federal programs at risk
The federal budget is even more complicated. With Trump’s proposal in mind, the Republican-controlled Congress drafts its own spending bill, which the president must ultimately sign. The House of Representatives put forward its spending proposal in April, but unlike Trump’s budget, the House version doesn’t mention the 2023 earmark to the San Diego pride centers or the US Education Department’s Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education.
That’s probably because the House is  focused on high-dollar programs, said Iris Palmer, the director of community college policy at the think tank New America. She said the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, about $200 million a year, is “not even a drop in the bucket.”
Even if Congress funds higher education programs that Trump wants to cut, Palmer said the administration could try to avoid implementing them. “They’ve fired everyone,” she said, “It makes it very hard to run grant programs.”
Regardless, the San Diego pride centers are planning to exhaust their federal funds no later than next summer, and earmarks are, by design, a one-time grant. All told, about half of the Mesa Pride Center’s budget comes from the federal earmark, said Lira. The rest is from the state, and the state Legislature has signaled that money will continue, at least into next year.  
Smith, the San Diego colleges’ district chancellor, didn’t specify how, exactly, the pride center will handle the cuts, though he said that some resources will “definitely go away.” 
Once the Lavender Celebration is over, a few students and volunteers remain to clean up, including Valerie Seng, a professor of medical assisting at Mesa College, and Sage Shevkolenko, a student and project assistant at the pride center. In a community where some students don’t feel comfortable going home or coming out, they’re a bright spot: Seng is Shevkolenko’s mom. 
“It means a lot,” said Shevkolenko, referring to her mom’s presence at the event, as they both helped take down the streamers and began dismantling the branded backdrop where students took photos in their stoles. “I know that a lot of families don’t have that privilege.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052025_Lavender-Graduation_ZM_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

Re: “Trump administration restores dementia research it gutted as part of its DEI purge“
As a clinician scientist dedicated to understanding the roots of dementia, I’ve long believed that science, integrity and compassion must guide our work. Recently, these values were put to the test.
After years of progress under a federal grant researching vascular contributions to cognitive decline, our work was disrupted and nearly completely derailed. What followed was a difficult, monthslong appeals process that required legal and financial collaboration to address misrepresentations of our research, many rooted in misapplied diversity, equity and inclusion language. 
It was a painful reminder of how easily vital work can be threatened by bureaucracy.
Further setbacks, including the heartbreaking loss of 50 study participants in a single month, deepened the toll on our team. But we persisted, not just for ourselves, but for the millions of families impacted by dementia.
The community I work with and the participants who continue to believe in our mission have my gratitude. With recruitment reopened through September, our commitment to transparency and progress remains steadfast.
This experience has only reinforced my belief that research must be protected — because behind every data point is a human story, and behind every story is hope.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/030725-Science-Protest-Sacramento-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

As teens across the country gear up for summer break, new data from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety is raising alarms about a deadly seasonal trend on the roads.
From 2019 to 2023, more than 13,000 people were killed in crashes involving teen drivers nationwide — and over 30% of those fatalities happened during the summer months between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Dubbed the “100 Deadliest Days,” this period consistently sees a spike in teen-related traffic deaths, with an average of eight people killed daily in such crashes during summer, compared to seven on an average day during the rest of the year.
“Summer months are particularly dangerous as more young drivers hit the road during school breaks with many logging more unsupervised driving time than usual,” said Jana Tidwell, spokesperson for AAA Mid-Atlantic.

In 2023 alone, crashes involving teen drivers claimed 2,897 lives nationwide — with 860 of those deaths occurring during the 100 Deadliest Days.
Delaware not immune to rising death toll
Delaware has seen its share of tragedy.
According to crash data analyzed by AAA, 63 people died in the state in crashes involving teen drivers from 2019 to 2023.
One-third of those deaths — 21 in total — occurred during the summer months.

Risky behaviors behind the wheel
Teen drivers are engaging in a range of high-risk behaviors, according to AAA’s 2023 Traffic Safety Culture Index. Among teen drivers aged 16 to 18:

46% admitted to reading a text or email while driving.
42% talked on a handheld phone.
49% exceeded speed limits on residential streets.
30% ran red lights.
17% drove without wearing a seatbelt.
10% admitted to driving after using marijuana.

Worryingly, many teens believe that a serious crash “won’t happen to them,” but AAA stresses that even responsible teens can make bad decisions behind the wheel.
“We encourage families to take advantage of AAA resources like our driver education classes and parent-teen safe driving agreements to help set clear expectations for driving privileges,” Tidwell said.
Parents can make a difference
Experts say parents play a key role in promoting safe driving habits.
Modeling good behavior, setting clear rules, and staying involved in their teen’s driving are proven ways to reduce risk.
AAA also recommends that teens take comprehensive driver education courses during the summer months and use phone features like “Do Not Disturb While Driving” to cut down on distractions.

The Assembly’s top Democrat, who opposed that ballot measure, said he suspects changes to Nevada’s closed primary system are coming whether the political establishment wants it or not: “The dam is going to break one way or another. The question is: Are we going to be part of the process?”
To that end, Yeager is proposing Assembly Bill 597, which would allow nonpartisan voters to participate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. He introduced the bill as an emergency measure on Monday, a week before the end of the session, and presented it to the Senate and Assembly committees on legislative operations and elections during a joint meeting Thursday.
Yeager described his bill as a “pushing back” to Question 3, the election reform proposal approved by voters in 2022 but rejected by voters in 2024. That ballot measure, which needed to pass twice because it proposed amending the state constitution, was heavily funded by out-of-state election reform groups.
Those groups viewed Nevada as “a playground in which they can experiment,” Yeager said. “We know they will continue to attempt to exploit this issue” of closed primaries “to fool around with our elections.”
AB 597 is “much simpler” than Question 3. There would still be Republican and Democratic primaries. The only change would be that a registered nonpartisan voter could cast a ballot in one of them. (Question 3 proposed putting all candidates on the primary ballot regardless of political party, with the top five finishers appearing on the general election for voters to rank in order of preference.)
Yeager described AB 597 as a common sense solution that addresses the growing number of nonpartisan voters in the state. 
As of April 2025, 34.9% of registered voters in Nevada are nonpartisan, 29% are Republican and 29% are Democrats, according to the Secretary of State’s Office. The remaining 7% of registered voters are members of minor parties like the Independent American or Libertarian parties.
That means nonpartisan and third-party voters are the biggest voting bloc in the state. Yet they are unable to participate in the primary elections their tax dollars pay for unless they agree to temporarily affiliate with a major political party.
The Nevada State Democratic Party, which opposed Question 3, has not expressed support or opposition for AB 597. But Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat and the state’s top election official, spoke in support of the bill.
The Nevada State Republican Party is strongly opposed to AB 597, as they were to Question 3. Representatives from the state party and affiliated local party groups argued that allowing nonpartisans to participate in party primaries would dilute party values and invite interference from outsiders.
Opponents also argued the bill is unnecessary because nonpartisan voters can already participate in a primary by temporarily registering to a political party. Nevada offers same-day voter registration, which means nonpartisan voters have that option all the way through election day.
“I think that practically that just doesn’t happen,” Yeager countered. “People are not going to change party registration and then change back. They’re not partisan for a reason or not affiliated for a reason.”
Some election advocates worry nonpartisan voters may similarly be turned off by the process laid out in AB 597. Yeager plans to introduce an amendment to require nonpartisan voters request a political party primary ballot by “the 7th Monday before the election day.” (In real terms: That would have been April 23 for last year’s June 11 primary.)
Nonpartisans after that date would have to vote in person.
Yeager’s proposed amendment would also keep the state-run presidential preference primary closed.
Doug Goodman, the founder of Nevadans for Election Reform, has pushed for fully open primaries for more than a decade. He took a neutral position on AB 597, saying the bill is “far from ideal” and only “a small start.”
The bill doesn’t address disenfranchisement of voters registered to minor parties, who still would be unable to participate in a major political party primary without leaving their preferred party. It also doesn’t address the issue of voters not being able to cast ballots in the significant number of races decided in competitive primaries where the winner goes on to run unopposed in a general election. That is a particularly common occurrence in districts that lean heavily toward one party.
Sondra Cosgrove, another outspoken advocate for election reform in Nevada, took a similar position as Goodman, though she described herself as “reluctantly in support” of AB 597.
“In America elections belong to the people, not the political parties,” she said in a statement to the Current. “So, I plan to run a ballot question in 2026 to adopt a fully open primary so that the people of Nevada can discuss how we would like our primary election to be managed.
Many political commentators believe major election reform will only come to Nevada through a ballot measure backed by outsiders because the existing political establishment benefits from the current system.
The Legislature must adjourn Monday, leaving lawmakers only a few days to pass Yeager’s bill. If they do, it could still be vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has already vetoed one election bill this session.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/steve-yeager-2-1024x751.jpg,,,2025-05-30 09:05:38.557257

Dysfunction in the Missouri General Assembly might also mean the Show Me State has nothing to offer. A last-minute plan by Gov. Mike Kehoe to help finance stadium projects for the Royals and Chiefs derailed in the state Senate.
Missouri lawmakers return Monday for a special session to, among other things, pass a stadium proposal. But as it stands now, Kansas is in the driver’s seat to get, in theory, both the Royals and Chiefs. Notably, an affiliate of the Royals recently purchased a mortgage in Overland Park secured by the Aspiria campus, which is at 119th Street and Nall Avenue.
But economists say Kansas can’t afford both teams.
“You are not going to generate enough net revenue to cover one of the facilities, let alone two,” said Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor of public finance at the University of Colorado Denver.
Propheter did say there’s a way Kansas could afford both stadiums, but that requires “cannibalizing activity from other businesses.”
A majority of Kansas lawmakers disagree, and say getting the Chiefs or Royals is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But whether STAR bonds can support one or two teams depends on who you ask.
 The Kansas STAR bonds proposal

STAR bonds, or sales and tax revenue bonds, are bonds that are paid by taxes generated in a bond district — hence the name. In a stadium proposal, taxes collected from bars, restaurants or any other businesses in the bond district would pay back the debt. Typically, STAR bonds are paid off in 20 years.
“(Kansans are) not going to pay a dime unless they visit the district,” Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican, said last year.
That’s the logic behind the state’s proposal. Lawmakers last year approved a plan that would authorize Kansas to finance up to 70% of stadium costs with the bonds.
Supporters say the Chiefs and Royals would spark an economic boom that will bring new dollars into Kansas. All that economic activity would literally and figuratively pay off in the long run.
Almost 80% of STAR bonds projects are on track to be paid off early, the Kansas Department of Commerce said in 2024. STAR bonds have been used to finance other sports stadiums like the Kansas Speedway and Sporting Kansas City’s Children’s Mercy Park.
But STAR bonds have never been used for projects of this magnitude. A Chiefs or Royals stadium would be by far the largest project in the program’s history. And previous STAR bonds have only funded at most 50% of construction costs, not 70%.
The Kansas Speedway’s original bond was $24.3 million for a stadium that opened in 2001. That’s equivalent to about a $47 million bond when adjusted for inflation. Children’s Mercy Park received a $150 million bond before its 2011 opening.
Those figures would only cover a small fraction of the construction for a new Chiefs or Royals stadium. New stadiums for the Texas Rangers, Las Vegas Raiders and the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers opened in 2020. They had $1.2 billion, $1.9 billion and $5.5 billion price tags, respectively.
A 2021 audit from the Kansas Legislative Division of Post Audit found questionable returns from some STAR bonds. Notably, the Prairiefire project in Overland Park defaulted on its STAR bonds last year. Topeka Heartland Park and the Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas, also failed to pay back their bonds. And Strataca, the Hutchinson salt museum, is only projected to break even in 43 to 118 years.
 Economists concerns

Propheter, the University of Colorado Denver associate professor, knows a lot about stadium funding plans. He said they don’t always work as advertised.
He said risk is unavoidable with these types of projects and they never start off profitably. It takes years to build the stadium and the surrounding district. That’s years of debt not being paid back.
Propheter said most of the money generated from the stadiums won’t be new to the metropolitan area. The Royals aren’t going to bring in tens of thousands of out-of-town fans for a Tuesday night game. But they will bring out tens of thousands of people who would already be spending money locally. These fans are spending money at the stadium instead of at a movie theater, bowling alley, restaurant or other local business.
Kansas wants projects financed by STAR bonds to attract 30% of their visitors from 100 miles away and 20% from outside Kansas. The 2021 audit of STAR bonds found that only three of 16 projects — the Hutchinson salt museum, Topeka Heartland Park and Kansas Speedway — met both goals.

A Chiefs or Royals stadium would likely draw a fair share of out-of-state visitors because the teams have been based in Missouri for so long. But Propheter isn’t convinced the economic activity will be worth it.
“A lot more people would travel to Kansas,” he said. “Would it be enough to generate the money needed to pay the debt? No.”
Nathaniel Birkhead, associate professor of political science at Kansas State University, also is wary of sales and other tax dollars being used to pay off bonds.
He said STAR bonds have struggled to pay off up to 50% of project costs before. Now, these bonds could pay up to 70% of one or more billion-dollar projects. That’s concerning to Birkhead.
“There’s some logic behind the STAR bonds,” he said. “However, I still fundamentally think it’s dishonest to say that something will pay for itself.”
Birkhead said the Chiefs, for example, are guaranteed no more than nine regular season games. The teams also could host concerts or other events to keep their stadiums busy, but there is no guarantee that happens.
He wonders how busy the STAR bond district will look when a game is not being played that day.
Then there’s uncertain economic projections. Ongoing concern about inflation and uncertainty around federal tariffs could make construction more expensive. A possible recession also would prevent people from spending money on sports events.
 Building a stadium district

Brian Mayes, a lead political strategist who also worked on the Vote Yes! Keep the Rangers campaign in Texas, said there was a point in his life where he might have agreed that stadium debt is hard to pay off. But Mayes, who has worked on the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers stadium funding, said new stadium development is just different. There’s just so much economic development around these stadiums, he said.
Mayes said Rangers and Cowboys games always keep the businesses around the stadiums busy. But so too do the concerts, conventions and other stadium offerings. The Cowboys offer tours of the locker rooms, and people show up.
That’s not to mention mega events like hosting a Super Bowl.
Mayes remembers when the Cowboys left Irving, Texas, for the new stadium in Arlington. The old site of the Cowboys stadium still sits undeveloped. Meanwhile, Arlington now has a booming tourism district that is helping pay off other government projects.
“(We said) put the Cowboys to work for Arlington,” he said. “It was the economic generator, and the additional tax revenue that was made by the Cowboys helped the city pay for roads and parks and police.”
Scott Sayers is a senior technical architect with Gensler Kansas City. Gensler has worked on dozens of sports projects, including the Rams Village in Los Angeles, Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., and M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.
Sayers said more people want to spend time before or after the game hanging around. Maybe they are talking about what they just saw or wanting to enhance the pregame experience.
Sayers doesn’t have specific opinions on STAR bonds and whether Kansas can afford one or two teams. But he does know that the Chiefs or Royals can create a prosperous stadium district if they work toward it — whether that would be in downtown Kansas City or suburban Kansas.
The state already did that when it created The Legends next to the Kansas Speedway and Children’s Mercy Park. Sayers said that area used to be an empty field before becoming a bustling, dense shopping and entertainment district.
The teams can build thriving entertainment districts when they treat the stadium and its surrounding areas as one cohesive community, he said.
“People have expectations,” Sayers said. “No longer are the days where 7:05, the event starts. I get dropped off at 6:40 … I want to start those experiences at 5 o’clock, at 4:30.”

Diane Lewis, who has chaired the party’s Utah chapter for the last four years, didn’t throw her hat in the ring for another term in her role. But, with four other candidates eager to pick up where she left off, she’s hopeful for the future of organized Democrats in deep red Utah.
“I have never seen as much excitement and turnout at our conventions. I would say that our turnouts probably have doubled (in different Democratic events across the state),” Lewis said on Thursday. “New people, young people, people wanting to get involved, run for office.”

There are two major candidates for chair this year — former Rep. Brian King, a widely-known face in state politics for about 16 years who left his spot at the Utah House to compete in last year’s gubernatorial elections with no success, and newcomer Ben Peck, who has been behind campaigns that have flipped some red offices to blue. 
Jonathan Lopez, an IT technician who has been behind other Democratic campaigns and is also running for chair, didn’t answer an interview request, and the fourth candidate, Archie A Williams III, didn’t list his information on the party’s website prior to the convention.
Committing to such a role didn’t come easy for King, he said on Thursday. But, after seeing President Donald Trump’s election and bracing to witness another legislative session with a Republican supermajority, this time from the sidelines, he couldn’t stand the idea of sitting on his hands.
He sees that ubiquitous red presence in Utah politics as a monopoly that needs to be of lower intensity with more competition.
Strategizing before election, Utah Democrats plead ‘come back home’

“People may not realize how damaging it is to have a monopoly of political power, like we do in Utah,” King said. “The Republicans have a supermajority in the legislature. They control the executive branch with the governor. They control the great majority of counties here in the state, and it’s not good for Utahns to not have more healthy competition.”
Most Democratic elected officers represent areas along the Wasatch Front. However, King believes that Utahns in rural counties are ready for a change of policies to tackle issues they deal with daily.
“When you’re in the supermajority for long enough, like the Republicans are, you get complacent. You think that you don’t have to address people’s problems, you don’t have to work hard,” he said.
During his campaign, he has also seen more engagement from affiliates who, since Trump took office, have felt the need to step up, he said, “and push back against government overreach at the state level and the federal level.” 
While King has been around for longer and has an extensive list of flashy endorsements, including Salt Lake City and Salt Lake County mayors, among other prominent Utah Democrats, Peck said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about his chances on Saturday.



Let us know what you think...


 


“My message seems to really be resonating with people,” Peck said. “I know it’s going to be an uphill battle. Brian has a long history here in the state and in the party, but I think that people are ready for a change, ready to try something new.”
He knows what it takes to win in Utah, he said, highlighting the successful campaigns he ran that elected Natalie Pinkney in a tight race for a Salt Lake County Council seat, and Sheila Srivastava, the first woman elected to serve as Salt Lake County treasurer.
At 25 years old, he also believes the party needs representation from younger people, as support appears to be slipping in that group and the state Legislature keeps its Republican supermajority. 
“It’s hard for people who have been involved in politics for decades to credibly tell people ‘I’m going to fix it. Things are going to change now,’ because people rightly come back with, ‘well, why haven’t you done it yet?’” Peck said.
The day will start and end early at Ogden High School, with delegates convening in smaller caucuses to discuss issues like approaches to health care, education and labor, among others, and to elect new leadership, including the party’s vice chair, secretary and treasurer.   
Delegates will also vote on a party platform highlighting Utah Democrats’ belief in economic security, equality of opportunity and investing in the common good for all. Additionally, they’ll make their choice on two resolutions, one relating to veterans, and the other to take an official stand against presidents running for three terms. 
While Lewis is looking forward to her retirement, she is also excited about seeing where the party goes now.
“We have amazing leaders in each county party, and they’re willing to work. I hope that the new leadership of the state party sees that whole thing, and that they continue to build from where we are now,” Lewis said. “Because the only place we can go is up.”

Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice organized the event for the public to show empathy to immigrants in the wake of all the anti immigration bills currently in legislature. The Alabama Legislature considered several proposals during the 2025 session to place further restrictions on peple without legal status. Photographer: Andi Rice for Alabama ReflectorDespite spending a great deal of time on the issue in the 2025 session, the Alabama Legislature only passed two bills targeting those without appropriate authorization to reside in the country.
SB 63, sponsored by Sen. Lance Bell, R-Pell City, requires law enforcement in Alabama to take fingerprints and DNA samples of people without the documentation to live in the U.S. and submit them to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and the Alabama Department of Forensic Science.
SB 53, sponsored by Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, made it a crime, a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine, for people to knowingly transport a person without the appropriate documentation to reside in the country into the state.
The bill also required county or municipal jail administrators to investigate those placed into custody to determine a person’s immigration status and check with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security if the individual was issued an immigration detainer or warrant.
“Many of these bills were created to address problems that don’t exist in Alabama,” said Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice. “The majority of these bills were copycat bills that were developed at national thinktanks and distributed out to different legislators around the country to implement in their states.”
But several other immigration bills stalled before getting a final vote.
HB 7, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, would have allowed state and local law enforcement to enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to enforce the country’s immigration laws, an authority that currently belongs only to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office.
The House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee approved the legislation in February, soon after the 2025 session began, but the full chamber did not vote on the measure until April. The legislation did not come to a vote in the full Senate.
HB 3, sponsored by Rep. Chip Brown, R-Hollingers Island, would have enhanced penalties for people convicted of felonies if they cannot prove they have legal authorization to be in the U.S. A Class D felony, punishable by up to five years in prison to a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
Those convicted of a Class C felony would have their punishment upgraded to a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine. People who commit a Class B felony would have their convictions upgraded to a Class A felony, punishable by up to 99 years in prison and a $60,000 fine.
Individuals found guilty of a Class A felony, the most serious offense, would have had to serve at least 15 years in prison.
Other legislation would have made labor brokers register with the Alabama Department of Workforce and must then report the foreign nationals they place with companies through contract work.
Another bill, HB 297, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Fidler, R-Silverhill, would have originally imposed a fee on international wire transfers, often used by immigrants to support families overseas. But the legislation was heavily amended to require reports on certain overseas cash transactions.
All the bills eventually stalled in the Senate.
One bill attempted to restrict those without proper authorization by limiting their ability to drive in the state. SB 55, sponsored by Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, would have prohibited people who have a driver’s license from another state from driving in Alabama if the state that authorized it did not review a person’s legal status. The legislation stalled in the House chamber after it passed the Senate.
Legislators from a slate of other states introduced nearly identical legislation, so Hamilton said the bills are not tailored to the problems that residents face in Alabama.
“If they were really trying to address it, there were other bills that other representatives introduced that would have been more effective, but this bill was really about continuing to oppress immigrant communities and make life difficult,” she said.”
But those who favor more restrictions said actions are necessary to disincentivize people without appropriate authorization to live in the country.
“The objective here is to present people here with rational choices, and if they believe they are not going to succeed in what they are doing, then they either will not come to the United States at all, or if individual states within the country adopt policies that make it clear they are going to be partners in enforcement, those people will settle elsewhere in the county,” said Ira Mehlman, media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for immigration legislation like those introduced.
Debu Ghandi, senior director for immigration at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, cited a  2020 report from the organization that found undocumented immigrants contribute almost $80 million in federal taxes and $41 billion in state and local taxes each year. They also pay another $315 billion annually nationally through spending.
“Many industries often rely on their hard, and often dangerous, work,” he said. “Undocumented immigrants, in fact, cannot receive social and Medicare benefits, but they have to pay into these programs through the payroll taxes that they are required to pay even though they are not eligible for the benefits that these programs fund.”
Hamilton said there are potential negative consequences of these bills for the state.
“What Alabama would like in that case is a lot fewer workers and a lot fewer people, fewer restaurants, and just a sadder place,” she said.

Joe Lombardo’s wide-ranging crime bill was heavily criticized at its first hearing this week for not only seeking to undermine previous reforms passed in 2019, but for being crafted without any consultation with organizations involved in criminal justice reforms.
“With four days left in session, I don’t view this as being a sound approach to policy making,” said Athar Haseebullah, the executive director of the ACLU of Nevada to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.  “It’s just, I think we’re out of time.”
Lombardo was absent from Wednesday’s hearing of Senate Bill 457, which he has deemed the “Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act.”  
The legislation was presented by the Washoe County District Attorneys office and George Togliatti, the director of the Nevada Department of Safety.
The bill reduces the felony threshold for theft from $1,200 to $750, and proposes harsher punishment for a variety of crimes, including for people charged with repeated felony DUI offenses and those in possession of child pornography.  
The legislation would provide stricter punishment for youth who commit repeated crimes against teachers or social service workers, while also limiting eligibility for diversion programs for those convicted of felony abuse, neglect or exploitation of children or the elderly.
The Nevada Crime Statistics shows property crimes, violent crimes and domestic violence have all decreased from 2023 to 2024. 
In a presentation to state lawmakers in February, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department noted that property crimes had decreased nearly 13% since 2023. 
“When I look at some of these increases to the threshold for theft, I just think that we are putting more people into a situation which is going to really lead to higher recidivism rates,” said Democratic state Sen. Rochelle Nguyen.
In addition to not deterring crime, the legislation’s opponents said that move, along with other aspects of the bill, could drastically increase the prison population at a time the Nevada Department of Corrections is experiencing a budget shortfall. 
There is a $42 million fiscal note attached to the bill.
“We heard already at a (legislative) committee meeting of almost $60 million in overtime being paid out,” Haseebullah said, on top of lacking money to make needed repairs including to air conditioning systems. 
SB 457 was introduced April 7, roughly halfway through the session. 
Lawmakers questioned how a bill calling for substantial changes to the legal process has had so little input from anyone outside of the governor’s team, law enforcement and district attorneys. 
“It’s a lot to ask any organization to anticipate that the governor’s office is going to bring a bill of this magnitude,” Nguyen said. “I can’t believe that this wasn’t worked on during the last 18 months, since the last legislative session, since some of the provisions look very similar to what was presented in the last governor’s public safety bill.”
Tim Robb, the Homeland Security Adviser for the governor’s office, told lawmakers that “we worked with anybody that reached out to us” and said they made “every effort to work with as many” people who were available. 
That apparently didn’t include public defenders from Clark or Washoe County, the ACLU of Nevada, or any other groups involved in criminal legal reforms.
“We weren’t involved in this at all,” Angela Knott with the Washoe County Public Defenders Office. “We never received any other communication until yesterday, when we got the apology for not being included in this process. There has never been any genuine effort by the DA’s office or the governor’s office to hear from the people who are most directly affected by this bill.”
Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen, who said he supports several of the bill’s provisions, agreed that “people that sponsored the bill may have dropped the ball” and the discussion around the bill “should have been going on prior to the hearing in front of us with four or five days left.” The Legislature is scheduled to adjourn Monday.
Still fighting those 2019 reforms
On the campaign trail in 2022, Lombardo vowed to undo legislation passed in 2019 that brought modest reforms to the criminal legal process. 
“A lot of our laws in Nevada were changed” by that, Washoe County District Attorney Chris Hicks told lawmakers Wednesday. “I think there’s a lot of arguments in support and a lot of arguments that can be made negatively about that bill.”
He added the governor’s bill this session, “seeks to strike the balance.”
Clark and Washoe County public defenders, the ACLU of Nevada and the Nevada Fines and Fees Justice Center prepared a counter presentation not only to raise concerns about various aspects of the legislation but to remind lawmakers why they passed reforms in the first place. 
The 2019 legislation came together after years of data collection that began under Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval in 2018, said John Piro with the Clark County Public Defenders Office.
“It wasn’t just public defenders coming up with ideas,” Piro said. “The Department of Justice came here to Nevada to study ways to reduce crime, reduce recidivism, and improve outcomes while saving money.”
At the time legislation was being drafted in early 2019, “we were 15th highest in incarceration,” Piro said, adding that data showed “66% of first-time non-violent offenders entering into the prison system had no prior felonies.” 
The state’s legal process not only threatened to explode the prison population and significantly increase costs — a data analysis projected the current trajectory would increase the prison system’s budget by an additional 9 percent by 2028, costing an estimated $770 million – it also didn’t address root causes of why people enter prison or focus efforts on reducing recidivism. 
The legislation lawmakers ultimately passed in 2019, which lowered penalties for non-violent theft and drug crimes while increasing access to diversion programs and specialty court programs, had several iterations as it incorporated concessions based on input from district attorneys and police. 
Similar input from public defenders, the ACLU and other groups weren’t considered in the legislation Lombardo is proposing now, Piro said Wednesday. 
There are some provisions in Lombardo’s bill, such as those addressing DUI offenses, that those against the bill could support, he added. 
“These are things that we could have told them had they come and talked to us before,” Piro said. “We’ve been here the whole time.”

Vivian Malone became the first Black graduate of the University of Alabama in its 134 years of existence. 
Gov. George Wallace had blocked her entry two years earlier. The night after her 1963 admission, she awoke to learn Mississippi NAACP leader Medgar Evers had been assassinated. 
“I decided not to show any fear and went to classes that day,” she recalled, even as white students refused to return her smile or make eye contact with her. 
One night at midnight, someone knocked on her dormitory door and told her there was a bomb threat. No bomb was found, but bombs went off later that year, not far from her dormitory. Despite that, “I was never afraid,” she said. 
She graduated with a degree in business management and joined the civil rights division of the U.S. Department of Justice. She served as director of civil rights and urban affairs and later as director of environmental justice for the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2000, her alma mater gave her an honorary doctorate, and she told students, “You must always be ready to seize the moment.”

According to PARCA, in 2024, Birmingham, which used to be the state’s largest city, dropped to third place. Huntsville and Mobile have seen population increases.
The report says Mobile’s recent population growth came from annexations of neighborhoods within the county in 2023, which pushed the city’s numbers from less than 190,000 in 2020 to nearly 210,000 residents. However, PARCA reported even with the annexation, Mobile managed to lose 500 residents over the last year.

“The latest population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau reflects a trend we anticipated: continued population decline in some of the city’s older neighborhoods, despite the gains made through our successful annexation in 2023,” Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson wrote in an e-mail.
Stimpson said Mobile’s population decline can likely be attributed to the age of the housing stock and lack of large areas for new development and urban blight.
“We are continuing to make historic investments in affordable housing and blight remediation, but we know these issues don’t turn around overnight and require sustained focus and investment from the public and private sectors,” he said in the statement.
PARCA found that Birmingham’s population fell by over 29,000 residents from 2023 to 2024, while Montgomery’s dropped by only 289 residents in the same time frame. Steven L. Reed, mayor of Montgomery, said in a statement that PARCA’s data doesn’t reflect the reality of the city.
“While the report notes a population decline, we’re not fully confident in the accuracy of those numbers and are actively exploring the possibility of a mid-decade census count to get a clearer picture of Montgomery’s population,” the mayor said.
Reed said Montgomery has announced business expansions and new developments which have brought jobs and investment to the city. He added that Montgomery has also approved thousands of housing units and new houses in the city showcases the “growing demand and confidence in our community’s future.”
“We remain focused on building a Montgomery that attracts new residents and retains existing ones. From public safety and education to infrastructure and innovation, we are laying the foundation for sustained growth and opportunity. We’re confident in the progress we’re making today,” Reed said.
Other areas saw growth. According to PARCA, Brookside, a town in Jefferson County, grew by 13% from 2023 to 2024, the largest of any city or town in the state. This comes as a new neighborhood is being built in the town. 
Huntsville, Foley, Madison and Athens all saw population increases in 2024 making them the top four cities in Alabama to bring in the most new residents by numbers.
Huntsville added 4,100 new residents last year and the neighboring city of Madison and Foley in Baldwin County added just over 3,000 residents to their population. Athens, which borders Huntsville, added just over 1,600 residents to their city.

(Photo: Lynne Terry/Oregon Capital Chronicle)The Nevada legislative session will end in just a few days — and time is running out to pass legislation that’d save Nevadans millions of dollars on their pharmacy bills.
Senate Bill 316 would curb the power of pharmacy benefit managers, the secretive middlemen hired by insurers to negotiate prices with drugmakers and process prescription claims. Because PBMs dictate which drugs an insurer covers — and, thus, which medications patients can access — they wield immense power over our health care. And they use that power to line their own pockets at the expense of Nevada patients and small businesses.
Here’s how it works. Drugmakers offer insurers and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) discounts and rebates on medications — in exchange for agreeing to cover a medicine and steer patients toward it. PBMs profit by keeping a share of those discounts and rebates, and also by charging administrative fees based on a percentage of the drug’s nominal “list” price.
Since expensive drugs lead to larger discounts, fees, and profits, PBMs have a perverse incentive to steer patients toward higher-priced drugs. The result? PBMs secretly extract billions of dollars from drugmakers annually, while patients pay higher out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications and are denied coverage for cheaper alternatives.
This dynamic is devastating for Nevadans, over 80% of whom report worrying about affording future healthcare costs. PBMs’ manipulation of drug coverage often strips doctors and patients of the ability to decide which medication is best for an individual’s healthcare needs.
And PBMs harm patients in other ways as well — most notably by putting trusted, local community pharmacies out of business and forcing Nevadans to travel much further to pick up prescriptions.
PBMs often reimburse these independent pharmacies much less than their affiliated pharmacies. A Federal Trade Commission report examined reimbursement for two drugs and found that PBMs paid their affiliated pharmacies 20 to 40 times more than the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost. In some cases, independent pharmacies actually lose money every time a patient fills a prescription due to PBM clawbacks and fees.
This has put immense financial strain on our state’s independent pharmacies, which filled 5 million prescriptions in 2023. Indeed, over the last decade, about one in ten rural independent pharmacies across the nation have closed. That limits patient choice and makes it harder for Nevadans to fill urgently needed prescriptions.
PBMs’ exploitative practices also hurt small businesses in Nevada, which are already operating on thin margins. As the costs of prescriptions and employee health plans rise, small companies are forced to cut back on expansion plans, hiring, and employee benefits.
SB 316 would put an end to this abuse and enact reforms that Nevadans overwhelmingly support. For starters, the bill would tie a PBM’s compensation to the value of the service it provides, instead of the list price of medications. That would eliminate PBMs’ incentive to favor more expensive drugs over lower-cost ones. In a recent poll, 85% of state residents supported such a policy.
The legislation would also create more transparency and accountability over PBM practices. Today, the middlemen often operate in a black box, with patients and other health plans unaware of the consolidation and conflicts of interest that dictate PBM practices. SB 316 would establish a duty of care, requiring PBMs to put patients’ interests ahead of their own. Roughly nine in ten Nevadans are in favor of such a provision, according to the new poll.
The bill would further prohibit PBMs from reimbursing any pharmacy less than it reimburses an affiliated pharmacy. That would stop us from losing yet more independent pharmacies that provide critical services to patients across the state.
SB 316 would ensure much-needed oversight of PBMs and restore fairness to the marketplace in the state. More than 80% of Nevadans are very or extremely concerned that no such oversight currently exists.
Legislators must not let the session expire without easing those concerns — or preventing PBMs from exploiting Nevada businesses and patients for their own financial gain.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CVS-pharmacy-front-Lynne-Terry-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 11:09:26.607447

The movement toward greater consolidation is movement away from local input, community engagement and informed democracy.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David F. Kelley: On education reform, trust Vermont values.","This commentary is by David F. Kelley of Greensboro. He is an attorney and the former chair of the Hazen Union School Board. He was part of the legal team that represented more than two dozen rural elementary school districts that appealed forced mergers under Act 46.The road to education reform in Vermont has been long and winding, and we are at another crossroads. Driven by increasingly unaffordable property tax bills, House bill H.454 attempts to use district consolidation as a cost-saving measure along with a funding formula change meant to contain spending.With no proof that this tactic will actually save money (and plenty that suggests it will not), this legislation heads us dangerously in the wrong direction. We need to look both ways before we go any further down this road.H.454 proposes a massive transfer of power. If it is enacted, taxpayers will no longer get to vote on their school budgets. Rather than the checks and balances between local and state power, school spending will be determined by the governor and the Agency of Education.Additionally, this legislation will not only take away voters’ power to control local spending, but also the power over whether their school remains open. It severs ties between voters, communities, spending and governance decisions.READ MORE
It’s understandable that many superintendents want greater consolidation: bigger districts, fewer school boards, fewer meetings and more control will make their jobs easier. But advantages for central office come with costs.Those school boards and meetings instill leaders with an understanding of the communities they serve. The movement toward greater consolidation is movement away from local input, community engagement and informed democracy. The Legislature and administration spent the winter largely stymied on education reform, attempting to choose from among vastly unwieldy, universally unpopular proposals that do not address the real issues. Policymakers have become obsessed with creating a system with a larger scale.But Vermonters understand that size and scale have little effect on either fiscal responsibility or academic quality. Quality and cost should be the indicators receiving the most scrutiny. High-quality, cost-effective schools and districts come in all shapes and sizes.As we have already seen in Roxbury and Westford, the gravitational pull of the big towns on consolidated boards causes the closure of rural schools. Quite frankly there is no data to suggest that dynamic solves either our fiscal or academic problems. In fact, it may exacerbate them.But answers have emerged from a source that should not surprise us: our communities. Common-sense, bottom-up solutions are being offered by the 97 towns that make up the Rural School Community Alliance. RSCA has offered testimony that is well-documented, fact-based and articulately presented. The Alliance reminds us that elementary-aged children should be educated close to home, and that elementary schools are fundamental to a thriving community. They warn that closing rural schools will not fix Vermont’s problems and could create damaging new ones. They stress the need for an education funding system that provides immediate tax relief to low- and middle-income Vermonters and distributes education funds equitably, while strengthening high-quality education.Before we pass a bill, we need to:1) Carefully consider Vermont data. We need fiscal analysis of each district to know what produces good outcomes at sustainable costs and what doesn’t.2) Implement a public school approval and certification process using professional panels made up of Vermont experts who visit schools to make recommendations about budgets as well as programs.3) Model the real financial impacts of any changes including accounting for transition costs. Guessing about future tax impacts is not good enough. It’s dangerous to assume scale will deliver on cost effectiveness and quality.Local school boards have long delivered and managed the tough decisions Gov. Phil Scott has called for; unfortunately, the real cost drivers are out of school boards’ control. Clearly, there is real work to be done at the state level.Legislators should focus on getting health care costs under control and tackling the education fund by moving non-education needs into the general fund where they belong. They can address immediate tax relief for moderate income households by updating the outdated income sensitivity thresholds (so-called “tax cliffs”) without waiting to rewrite the entire funding formula. Vermont values grew out of a rural economy and a deep, abiding commitment to community. Community is the singular, non-monetizable asset that has long helped Vermont’s policies work at a human scale. Vermont’s schools reflect this history.Our system has evolved over generations springing from community, history and geography, and we need to respect the organic connections between people and place. Rather than attempting to control these from the top down, we need to listen to their messages and utilize their strengths.Above all, if we want to build a healthier education system, then we need to help Vermont get back to her most fundamental values. We need to reinvest in grassroots democracy with a renewed vitality in local decision-making.Read the story on VTDigger here:  David F.

A fairer tax system, based largely on ability to pay, would help us weather challenges while we restructure our education delivery in a more thoughtful way.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Zuckerman: Governor 1, Legislature 0.","This commentary is by David Zuckerman of Hinesburg, former Vermont lieutenant governor.The recently signed property tax bill, H.491, kicks the can down the road and sets up the governor to easily blame the Legislature for an even bigger increase in 2026. The Vermont Legislature has failed to stand up for Vermont’s education system, failed working-class taxpayers and failed to support our rural schools.The governor has effectively used property taxes as a weapon to propose deep cuts to the education system rather than addressing the underlying issues in his own budget and our soaring healthcare costs. Additionally, Gov. Scott has shifted rising human services costs onto the education fund for years and then successfully blamed the Legislature for tax increases.School taxes are too high for working and middle class Vermonters. Instead of focusing on fixing this problem, the governor has used this moment to propose an education overhaul that will lead to more pain for Vermont taxpayers and will result in the closure of many community schools.The bill that was just passed and signed by the governor uses over $100 million in one-time funds to reduce property taxes this year. This means in 2026, Vermont will have a huge increase like last year. While the governor and Legislature have delayed the pain, the bill they just passed does nothing to solve the problem. Instead, they could have rebalanced the burden more fairly by expanding income sensitivity to adjust for inflation. This has not been done for decades. Implementing this single change would have saved working Vermonters money this year and into the future. Additionally, they could have increased taxes on year-round second homes. There are about 51,000 “seasonal, occasional use, or vacation homes” in Vermont. Adding an average of $1,000 in additional property tax for those that are habitable year-round would have provided significant annual tax relief for working class Vermonters while funding the needs of our most vulnerable children.Instead, with this year’s yield bill, and policy moves towards a foundation formula, the Legislature has caved in a direction that will result in the forced closing of many small rural schools, reduced funding capacity for property-poor towns and will harm Vermont’s education quality. Given the federal funding disaster caused by President Trump, next year there will be no “surplus funds” to artificially lower taxes. The governor will use the tax pressure to continue to push his radical consolidation plan (with its fake savings that will not materialize,) and the political pressure will force the Democrats to cave. Meanwhile, taxes will still go up dramatically, and Democrats in Vermont will again underperform at the polls. I served in the Vermont Legislature for 18 years. Unfortunately, we could never get the majority to seriously consider many proposals to reform the tax system that would reduce the burden on working and middle-class taxpayers. Under the current foundation formula idea these same Vermonters will continue to pay an even larger share of their income than their higher-income neighbors.As costs such as health care, school building maintenance and repairs, computers, etc. inevitably rise, we will continue to struggle with these issues. A fairer tax system, based largely on ability to pay, would help us weather these challenges while we restructure our education delivery in a more thoughtful way.Of course, the biggest solution to Vermont’s fiscal challenges is for more young people to move here. Destroying our public school system is not the way to do that. Using the one-time and other more long-term resources to truly invest in affordable housing we would provide our employers with the workers they need, populate the schools with more children and share the tax burden.Over the next four years, as more people across the country seek places to live where the politics are less toxic, the climate is more moderate and the sense of community is thriving, many of them will choose Vermont if, and only if, we maintain and improve our high quality local schools rather than destroy them.Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Zuckerman: Governor 1, Legislature 0.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

We are updating our approach to prescribing controlled substances at the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Barlow and Allan Ramsay: A safer path forward for patients and our community.","This commentary is by Daniel Barlow — executive director of the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic in Barre and board chair of Vermont’s Free and Referral Clinic association — and Dr. Allan Ramsay, medical director at the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic.At the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic, we’ve always been guided by a simple mission: to care for our neighbors with compassion and dignity, regardless of their ability to pay. For over 30 years, we’ve offered free medical, dental and wellness services to thousands of central Vermonters who might otherwise go without. Our work is built on trust — between patients and providers, between the clinic and the community. As the world around us has changed, so too have the needs of the people we serve. Today, many of our patients face far more complex challenges than we saw a decade ago. Homelessness, addiction, trauma, food insecurity, untreated chronic illness — these aren’t just background issues; they shape our patients’ lives and health in profound ways. We are proud to stand beside them through it all.It’s with this understanding — and a deep commitment to safety — that we are updating our approach to prescribing controlled substances at PHWC. This new policy has been approved by our board of directors and will take effect on July 1.Let us be clear: this is not about denying care. It’s about providing care responsibly in a way that protects everyone — patients, volunteers and the community.For many years, PHWC has not prescribed opioids. That long standing policy remains in place and reflects our commitment to safe, appropriate care in a volunteer-based setting. This new policy builds on that foundation and strengthens our guidelines around other controlled substances, such as benzodiazepines and stimulants. Vermont has not been immune to the devastating effects of the opioid epidemic. We’ve lost too many lives to addiction and overdose — including in small towns like ours, where everyone feels the ripple effects. What began with prescription opioids has evolved into more dangerous and deadly substances like fentanyl. But the problem doesn’t end there.Medications like benzodiazepines (often prescribed for anxiety) and stimulants (used for ADHD) also carry high risks of misuse, dependency and diversion, especially when not closely monitored. When combined with opioids or used improperly, these medications can become lethal.In a free clinic setting like ours, where patients may lack consistent housing, stable support networks or regular access to primary care, those risks increase. That’s why our updated policy limits the use of controlled substances to short-term situations, under clear guidelines.Patients must complete a full evaluation, sign a medication agreement and commit to regular follow-ups. We will check the Vermont Prescription Monitoring System before each prescription or renewal and may require drug screenings. All prescriptions must come from, and be monitored by, the same provider. We know medications can be helpful — even essential — but they must be used carefully. That’s why we’re emphasizing safer options first: non-controlled medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen and non-drug approaches such as physical therapy, counseling and mindfulness. These approaches often offer real, long-term relief with far less risk.This policy is not only about medication — it’s about our clinic’s identity. PHWC is a place where people come for thoughtful, compassionate care. Our staff and volunteers give their time because they believe in community health. It’s our responsibility to make sure that the care we provide keeps everyone — patients, volunteers and staff — safe.We also understand that many in our community live with addiction or are in recovery. There is no judgment here — only support. Patients in need of treatment for substance use disorder will be referred to providers who specialize in that care. We’re also working to strengthen partnerships with mental health, housing and recovery programs to better serve our patients’ full range of needs.In developing this new policy, we’ve drawn on best practices from across Vermont and beyond. We’ve consulted with pharmacists, primary care providers and mental health professionals.Most importantly, we’ve listened — to our team, our board and our patients.Change can be challenging, but we believe this change is necessary. It reflects who we are and the kind of care our patients deserve — thoughtful, careful and centered on long-term well-being.If you’re a patient at PHWC and have questions, please talk to your provider. We’re here to listen. We’re here to help. As always, we remain committed to serving central Vermont with dignity, respect and heart.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Daniel Barlow and Allan Ramsay: A safer path forward for patients and our community.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)ABERDEEN — For the past few weeks, Kendrick Rochelle has been going to Washington’s overcrowded youth prison in Chehalis to build relationships with the young men held there.
Rochelle is trying to recruit them to join a leadership program at a new juvenile detention center called Harbor Heights on the grounds of an adult prison near Aberdeen, where he’ll serve as superintendent. Harbor Heights is set to open June 9.
He eats lunch with the young men incarcerated at Green Hill School, and just tries to be consistently present. At first, some were skeptical. But Rochelle says he’s been getting two or three applications per day from the men trying to get out of the poor conditions at Green Hill and better themselves.
Rochelle, who grew up without a father, started his career as a correctional officer before moving into criminal justice leadership roles in Ohio, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas.
The goal of his visits is to “show them a man with the same background as them that made it,” he said.
State officials showed off Harbor Heights on Thursday. The facility will start with eight men transferring from Green Hill, growing to a maximum capacity of 46 by the end of the fall, state Department of Children, Youth and Families Secretary Tana Senn said.
Harbor Heights will be open to those between the ages of 18 and 25 who are considered medium security. 
While on the Stafford Creek Corrections Center campus, Senn’s agency will run the facility. Department of Corrections Secretary Tim Lang likened his agency to a landlord. 
Harbor Heights will be a six-month rotation with perks for those chosen to move there. Each man will get his own room, with a small TV. 
Each room has a window, one of the biggest renovations made to the former adult prison isolation unit. The windows were previously opaque frosted glass. 
The facility has drawn criticism from some who say retrofitting the long-unused Department of Corrections unit is like “putting lipstick on a pig.” The unit toured Thursday features painted aquamarine accents, rooms filled with board games and books, photographs of beach scenes and motivational quotes throughout. 
“Welcome to the Harbor; where your future will take you to new Heights,” reads one. 
While at Harbor Heights, the young men will be able to develop leadership skills, receive therapy and learn to be a mentor before either returning to Green Hill or being released from custody. They’ll also have expanded opportunities for visitors and access to a three-quarter-acre yard.
Senn sees potential for “a hopeful place that provides a vision for what community can be” after release.
The facility provides small relief for the overcrowding that has enveloped Washington’s juvenile detention system. At Green Hill, one of the state’s two prisons for juvenile offenders, the population has fluctuated between 220 and 240, despite a safe operational capacity of 180, for many months.
For the young people held there, who are 17 and older, this has meant unsafe conditions wrought with fights and drugs, as well as more time isolated in their rooms without enough staff to supervise the programs that tend to make juvenile facilities more appealing than prisons. 
The crowding has come amid ballooning juvenile crime, with state law also changing in recent years to send young adults convicted of crimes committed under age 18 to youth detention, instead of adult prison, until they turn 25. 
Senn, a former state representative, calls the Harbor Heights opening an “important start.”
“This is not going to solve the overcrowding issue at Green Hill,” she acknowledged, noting her old colleagues in the Legislature need to provide money for additional capacity.
The two-year budget Gov. Bob Ferguson signed last week included $25 million to run Harbor Heights, but lawmakers failed to deliver a policy solution to address the broader crowding crisis, despite bipartisan interest.
Lawmakers set aside another $3 million to scout new medium-security juvenile detention facilities. One top prospect has been a minimum-security women’s prison in Mason County, which is slated for closure.
But any new facility would be at least four years out, Senn has said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3386-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletter Inside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown (D-Ohio). “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
The high cost of foodborne illnesses
Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas. “This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak involving peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
‘Life or death for our son’ 
E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

(Getty Images)Most people are talking about work requirements for federal assistance like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). But it’s another provision that could have a much bigger impact.
More than 600,000 Hoosiers received $1.44 billion in financial assistance to buy food in fiscal year 2024, mostly families with children who can’t make ends meet. That cost-sharing language for the federal program threatens to break Indiana’s budget or take out the program altogether.
A key provision in the federal reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House and now is being vetted in the Senate would require states to have skin in the game for SNAP. Right now, the benefits are 100% covered by the federal government with the state picking up half of the administrative costs.
But the proposal would require some states to cover as much as 25% of the benefits cost starting in 2028, depending on each state’s error rate. States with the highest error rates would pay more as a “state quality control incentive” to crack down on fraud and abuse.

The seven states with error rates below 6% would only need to cover 5% of the tab under the current version of the bill. But Indiana’s 10.5% error rate puts it into the highest tier for a match rate — even though it falls below the national average rate of 11.68%.
That means Indiana could be on the hook for as much as $360 million a year.
Coming off a budget session where state lawmakers had to cut higher education funding, child care aid and economic development programs, any new fiscal obligation will be a burden. But $360 million would be near impossible.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost-sharing component will save the federal government a little under $100 billion.
“CBO expects that some states would maintain current benefits and eligibility and others would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave the program altogether because of the increased costs,” the analysis found.
Gov. Mike Braun’s administration didn’t provide a comment on the possible ramifications.
It’s important to remember the hungry Hoosiers at the heart of this debate. Despite the error rate — which includes underpayments as well as overpayments — most are desperate families in need of additional assistance to put food on the table.
USDA research from fiscal year 2023 showed Indiana is among the lowest states in the percent of population receiving SNAP – between 8 and 10%. In comparison, six states and Washington D.C. were above 16% and all of Indiana’s neighbors rank higher.
To be eligible, you must have a monthly net income of less than $1,255 for a family of one; $1,704 for a couple and $2,600 for a family of four. That means if you live alone and make over $300 a week you are ineligible for SNAP.
The amount you receive depends on your income but the average monthly payment per participant in April 2025 was $196. That is down slightly from April 2024.
Indiana’s enrollment went up during the pandemic when additional emergency aid was available. But generally, it has been stable and ranks about mid-pack nationally. For instance, in April 2025 281,112 households or 588,184 individuals. Those numbers are a few percentage points lower than April 2024 and slightly down from Fiscal Year 2023.
Other changes being considered nationally include imposing work requirements on those receiving benefits. And some states, like Indiana, will ban using the benefits on candy and pop. I generally don’t have a problem with those proposals.
But the cost-sharing provision will undoubtedly take food from hungry adults and children, and I hope the U.S. Senate re-evaluates the pain it could cause.

Joshua Syberg/Indiana National GuardFederal officials could be eying Indiana’s Camp Atterbury as a temporary holding site for immigrant detainees as nationwide deportation efforts continue — and detention demands grow.
While no official decision has been announced, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed to the Indiana Capital Chronicle on Thursday that the agency is actively “exploring all options” to meet current and future detention needs. 
The statement comes amid a push by President Donald Trump’s administration to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport millions of people.
“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s enhanced enforcement operations and routine daily operations have resulted in a significant number of arrests of criminal aliens that require greater detention capacity in Indiana,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement. “While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements.”
So far, however, the Indiana National Guard “has no tasking or request” from federal authorities, a spokesperson told the Capital Chronicle.
The federally owned facility is licensed to and operated by the Indiana National Guard. It offers a variety of training ranges, live-fire venues, managed airspace with air-to-ground firing capabilities and an LVC simulation and exercise center.
Details still limited
For now, DHS officials have declined to provide a timeline or identify specific sites under consideration.
Camp Atterbury, located about 30 miles south of Indianapolis, has previously been used for large-scale federal operations. 
Most recently, in 2021, the facility temporarily housed thousands of Afghan refugees evacuated during the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan.

During Operation Allies Welcome, the base accommodated over 7,000 Afghan evacuees in 82 lodging buildings across six neighborhoods, complete with dining facilities and medical centers. The infrastructure includes dorm-style housing for families and open bay barracks for individuals, all equipped with heating, air conditioning and plumbing.
Camp Atterbury wouldn’t be the first military or state-owned site proposed to be repurposed by federal officials for immigration-related operations.
Most recently, Fort Bliss in Texas was identified as a potential deportation hub, with plans to hold thousands of detainees in massive tents on the Army base. The site could serve as the model for a dozen other holding facilities on military bases nationwide.
A lack of detention space could be a reason for ICE to tap Camp Atterbury and other locations.
The newest data released last week by DHS showed a drop in the number of immigrants in detention across the country for the first time since January — from 49,184 on May 4 to 48,870 on May 18 — but the shift could be due to existing detention facilities reaching capacity.
Congress allocated funds for 41,500 detention beds this year, almost 20% fewer than the current number of detainees.
Indiana ramps up enforcement
It’s unclear exactly how many people are currently being held in Indiana. Numbers can fluctuate daily as detainees are released or moved, so specific data is difficult to track.
Recent reporting by Mirror Indy revealed at least 400 ICE detainees being held at the Marion County Jail in Indianapolis. And the federal government is paying Marion County $75 per day for each person held.
As of March 17, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University reflected an average daily population of eight detainees at the Marion County Jail; and an average of 238 detainees at the Clay County Jail in Brazil, which is operated by the Clay County Sheriff’s Department and began housing ICE detainees in 2013 under contract with the federal government.

Using Camp Atterbury instead of local jails could save the federal government money.
There are an estimated 11 million immigrants who are not legally authorized to live in the United States, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan think tank. A separate report released Thursday by the Center for Migration Studies found the nationwide population of people without permanent legal status to be closer to 12.2 million.
Indiana’s unauthorized immigrant population was estimated to be around 102,000 as of 2019.
During the 2025 legislative session, state lawmakers passed multiple measures to boost immigration enforcement and ensure local compliance with federal directives.
That included House Enrolled Act 1393, which requires local law enforcement to notify federal immigration authorities about undocumented immigrants in custody.
After sharp debate, a separate and stricter immigration proposal failed to pass, though. House Bill 1531 would have required local law enforcement officers to comply with federal detainer requests for undocumented immigrants. The bill would have also banned employers from hiring unauthorized residents. Though the bill passed out of the House on a 64-26 vote, it never got a hearing in the Senate.

The 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a small change in a state where temperatures can vary from below zero to around 100 degrees, but it is a very significant rise over the time period given historical temperature trends, said Jen Brady, a meteorologist at Climate Central. 
The post Average summer temps in Massachusetts have risen by 2.75 degrees Fa[...]","MASSACHUSETTS HAS SEEN a striking rise in summer temperatures over the past half-century, with statewide averages climbing by approximately 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970 and leading to more frequent and intense heat waves, heightened public health risks, and dangerous conditions for essential workers. The state has experienced a rise in temperatures that is comparable to the national average temperature rise of 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit, according to researchers at Climate Matters, a nonprofit group of climate scientists and communications experts.Suffolk County, which contains Boston, has experienced the steepest increase — warming by 3.3 degrees, outpacing the rest of the state and highlighting the amplifying effects of urban heat islands. Four other counties –Norfolk, Middlesex, Plymouth, and Worcester – had temperature rises above 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Climate Central’s analysis used monthly temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – the federal agency tasked with predicting and monitoring weather and climate – to find the average temperature change in March to May from 1970 to 2024.“Without human-caused climate change, the temperature would not have risen as much as it did,” said Jen Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central who leads investigations into climate trends and impacts. “[Global] temperatures will keep increasing, and already we’re locked into a certain amount of the increase because greenhouse gases – once they’re released into the atmosphere – don’t dissipate immediately.”The 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a small change in a state where temperatures can vary from below zero to around 100 degrees, but it is a very significant rise over the time period given historical temperature trends, said Brady.Warmer summers can lead to emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses increase during unprecedented heat waves. Children, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women, and outdoor workers are particularly impacted.Ian Sue Wing, an economist at Boston University who researches the health impacts of heat exposure, noted that Massachusetts has an aging population with almost a quarter of all residents who are 60 or older. “[Older] folks are extremely sensitive to heat because it turns out that, as you age, you are less able to effectively thermo-regulate,” said Wing.Cities are particularly likely to get hotter than the surrounding areas because there are fewer trees and green spaces that can bring the temperature down. They also have densely developed buildings, roads, concrete, and other heat sinks that absorb and release heat on hot days. That is one of the reasons why Suffolk County – which includes Boston, Chelsea, and Revere – might have warmed more than other parts of Massachusetts.“The entire city of Boston is a heat island,” said Zoe Davis, a climate resilience project manager for Boston. “But not everyone experiences a hot day in Boston in the same way. Some areas of Boston are hotter than the rest of the city, entering high-heat conditions sooner, reaching higher air temperatures, and remaining in heat wave conditions longer.”Ben Cares, Chelsea’s director of Housing and Community Development, said that residents of Chelsea – a city with a high proportion of immigrant and low-income residents – can be particularly vulnerable to extreme heat because many face language barriers which keep them from important information on how to protect themselves. Many are essential workers who can’t afford to not go to work even on dangerous heat days, and the city’s high levels of air pollution can make it harder to breathe with the heat. “As extreme heat increases, it’s not just that it’s uncomfortable; it’s becoming dangerous for our residents,” Cares said. “For low-income families, seniors, and communities of color, it isn’t just a weather issue. It’s an environmental justice crisis.”Essential workers who have to commute into work on hot days and those who work outdoors in jobs like construction or indoors in commercial kitchens or warehouses are also vulnerable. Workers can become dehydrated and overheated without proper hydration and well-timed breaks. There aren’t safety protocols around extreme heat in many workplaces across the state, according to Tatiana Begault, the head of the Massachusetts Coalition for Safety and Health, a group that focuses on protecting workers. Undocumented workers are the most vulnerable because they are unable to advocate for breaks or changes in work conditions without fear of retaliation, she said. Begault hopes that as temperatures warm, local and state governments will do more to protect essential workers from extreme heat. “Heat impairs concentration, memory, and decision making, which raises a lot of risk of workplace accidents, especially for those operating heavy machinery in construction areas,” said Begault. “[Essential workers] are part of a community and a population that is severely under monitored, under served, and under prepared.”The post Average summer temps in Massachusetts have risen by 2.75 degrees Fahrenheit in past 55 years, according to new data appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Emergency-room-CC.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 08:00:02.136625

How honest should elected officials be with the public?
It’s not a rhetorical question. In Kansas City, recent decisions by the mayor suggest a level of opacity that warrants closer scrutiny — not outrage, necessarily, but concern.
Mayor Quinton Lucas has sidestepped ethics rules, not by breaking them outright, but by rerouting gifts through a nonprofit shielded from disclosure. His lavish trips, funded by interests with business before the city, now appear routine.
The problem isn’t where he travels. It’s who pays, and what they stand to gain.
A series of reports by The Missouri Independent outlined a troubling pattern in the mayor’s conduct — one centered on secrecy, donor influence and potential retaliation against a whistleblower.
At issue: his ties to politically-connected contractors, campaign finance maneuvering and the use of a nonprofit to obscure gift-giving — all while pushing a publicly subsidized downtown stadium.
Kansas City mayor accused of skirting city gift ban by using nonprofit to pay for travel

At the center is the Mayors Corps of Progress for a Greater Kansas City Inc., a 501(c)(4) nonprofit with a vague mission. During Lucas’s first term, the organization covered more than $35,000 in travel, lodging, meals and tickets — including a $23,518 trip to the 2023 Super Bowl for Lucas, his then–chief of staff, and two police officers.
The day after the game, the Heavy Constructors Association (commonly called the Heavies), a major construction lobbying group, wired $24,000 to the nonprofit.
City ethics rules prohibit gifts over $1,000 to elected officials. Lucas claims these were work-related trips, yet he sought no city reimbursement and offered no public accounting. Instead, his team accepted dark-money donations from entities with business before the city, then kept the details quiet.
We only know of them because a whistleblower came forward. The pattern repeated in 2024 and 2025, when Lucas again hit the Super Bowl circuit — without a whistleblower to reveal who paid the bill.
In the following months, an anonymous investigation request was made to the Kansas City Municipal Ethics Commission, which just recently refused to engage, finding “no justification” warranting it.
Lucas, just back from a junket to Qatar, spoke about the issue with Kansas City radio host Pete Mundo.
“Big business exists around sports,” he told Mundo, “it is the reason that so many of us are spinning our wheels to see where the teams play.”
Lucas went on to say: “I will be in any room where I can share what is happening with Kansas City… with a bunch of rich people who have money to invest in Kansas City.”
The problem is not what room, or rather owner’s box, the mayor is in. Nor is the problem his rubbing elbows with wealthy people.
The problem isn’t money from afar; it’s money in the mayor’s back yard.
Lucas isn’t accepting gifts from people who want to invest in Kansas City; he (or rather his nonprofit, but that’s a distinction without much ethical difference here) is taking checks from businesses that want Kansas City to invest in them.
Specifically, the Royals, which donated $15,000 to the Mayors Corps in 2022, and the Heavies, with its $24,000 donation around the Super Bowl, benefit mightily from any taxpayer funding.
Lucas has presented himself as the man to make it happen — while refusing to disclose the terms of any deal.
It’s a huge potential conflict of interest that could be addressed with a little disclosure. Despite that, the mayor has doubled down on concealment, not transparency.
A cynic would say none of this is surprising, probably least of all to Lucas himself, who said: “I think the ethics commission got it right, I always knew they would.”
Kansas City mayor accused of retaliating against whistleblower who revealed nonprofit spending

The commission currently has five members, all appointed by Lucas.
To its credit, the commission recommended changes to the city’s code of ethics to clear up reporting requirements. But disregarding the complaint demonstrates the problem with dark money contributions. Because the Mayors Corps does not have any business before the city, the commission reasoned, there is no reporting requirement.
But the Mayors Corp got the money from people with business before the city. That starts to look like the nonprofit functions as a vehicle to launder donations — something that, again, could be addressed with a little disclosure and that, you’d think, the group would be eager to clear up.
Mark Funkhouser, Kansas City’s mayor from 2007 through 2011, said when he entered office that the Mayors Corp, “was explained to me as a slush fund that mayors had been using for many years to do just this sort of thing. Needless to say, I didn’t have any fat cats willing to set up and contribute to such a fund for me.”
Lucas does.
In the radio interview, Lucas argued that by getting donations to pay for his trips, he was being a good steward of the city’s finances. He called the idea that the city should cover his expenses, “preposterous.”
Taxpayers take note: If you’re not paying for what your elected officials are up to, then there’s a pretty good chance you’re the product, not the customer.
Advocating for taxpayer-funded development is one thing. Accepting undisclosed corporate gifts while doing so is another. It’s not just a bad look; it undermines the city’s ethics framework and public trust. The public deserves transparency, not evasive answers and twisted reasoning.
And they deserve a mayor who respects rules, and the spirit of them.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/426121962_707597881550725_3470030060976740617_n-1024x634.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

From behind the register, Haley Newman said monitoring what sells fast and soliciting feedback from customers is helping the store owners learn what works and what doesn’t.
Photo by Gordon Miller/News & CitizenThis story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on May 29. For nearly two years, there was no way to consistently purchase fresh produce in Johnson. The newly opened Johnson General Store changed that.Since the Sterling Market closed following the flood of July 2023 and the grocer that operated it decided not to reopen the location, which had been repeatedly inundated over the years at its vulnerable position at the confluence of the Lamoille and Gihon rivers, the town had been without a grocery store.The restaurants, gas stations, the dollar store and the Foote Brook farm stand in the summer months have helped fill the void, but fresh vegetables could only be acquired during the long winter months by taking a trip to Morrisville, which is seven miles away if you live in the village and even farther if you live outside of it, and only an option for those who have a car to drive.With a grocery store’s return to the former Sterling Market location looking increasingly doubtful, longtime resident Mike Mignone and his wife Haley Newman stepped in to fill the gap by opening the Johnson General Store on Lower Main Street.During the noon hour last Friday, a steady flow of customers signaled that the store, which opened May 9, is already settling in as part of the community. From behind the register, Newman said monitoring what sells fast and soliciting feedback from customers is helping the store owners learn what works and what doesn’t.“We keep selling out of things that we didn’t necessarily expect would go so quickly,” Newman said. “There are certain things, like fresh produce, that we don’t want to order in large quantities and have them go bad, but then we’re selling them immediately and running out of different things.”Mignone, who previously ran Hangry Mike’s food truck and has a background in the restaurant industry, had planned to open something similar, but after participating in the Reimagine Johnson initiative organized by Vermont Council for Community Development, where increasing food access had emerged as a vital goal for the community in the wake of the 2023 flood, he and Newman decided to prioritize a general store instead.Supported by community members and the emerging food access task force, Mignone and Newman have put their own capital and equity on the line to open the store in the building they’re leasing from the former operators of the Get Yours head shop.They’ve taken out loans from both the town and the village revolving loan funds — which are meant to encourage just such a community-oriented operation — filling the gap with their own savings and ensuring all the requirements for the licenses they needed were met, all while managing a family that includes two elementary school-age kids and a fifteen-month-old.Mike Mignone, who opened the new Johnson General Store in May with his wife Haley Newman, has already been busy making prepared food options. Photo by Gordon Miller/News & CitizenIn February, a few months after Mignone announced his intent to open the general store, the Sterling Market property owners announced they would pursue a property buyout, ending speculation that a grocer might return to that location and making the need for the general store ever more urgent. Associated Grocers of New England, the former operator of the Sterling Market, is now the general store’s supplier.The response Newman and Mignone have gotten from the community so far has primarily been gratitude.“So much gratitude, so many smiles, so much excitement,” Newman said. “It’s really made all of the headaches and stresses of the past six months trying to get open worth it.”A variety of fruit, vegetables, pantry staples and dry goods line evenly spaced shelves in the closely kept but clean, well-lit space. There are plenty of locally and regionally produced goods, and Newman said there’s more on the way. Occasional empty space on the shelves marks where customers have been particularly enthusiastic, and Mignone has already rolled out some ready-made options in a warming case at the back of the store.At the community forums held as part of the Reimagine Johnson process, many remarked that it wasn’t the food they missed most about the Sterling Market, but its role as a place where shoppers ran into their neighbors.The Johnson General Store is cozier than the old grocery store, and options more limited, but neighbors are already showing up. It’s the first general store in Johnson since Facey’s General Store, which last advertised in the News & Citizen in 1976, though DJ’s Corner Store and Deli had served a similar role in the same location well into the 2000s before its deli case was swapped out for glass pipes.Johnson newcomer Joy Novakowski, who stopped by on Friday for a cup of coffee and a muffin to go, said food access had been important to her and her partner, and they had joined the food access task force when they came to town.As with the recent monumental move of the Johnson Public Library from its longtime, flood-prone home on Railroad Street to higher ground at Legion Field, Novakowski sees the general store as part of Johnson’s changing narrative.“It’s not only an essential hub, but socially, this is where we meet our neighbors,” she said. “With a community that’s trying to rebuild itself in so many ways and has the capacity to retain and grow, what does that story look like for Johnson when we’re actually nourishing the residents and people who are coming through to visit, too?”The Johnson General Store’s story is just beginning, but just getting its doors open has felt like a monumental accomplishment to Mignone.“We’ve got a long road ahead of us, but it’s been nice to be actually running the store,” he said.“We’re just relieved that we made it,” Newman said. “There were so many moments of like, ‘Are we ever going to open the doors?’ Because it was just roadblock after roadblock after roadblock, and then waiting on different permits and licenses, and then that final week, everything came together.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Johnson General Store gets warm welcome.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/johnson-general-store-1-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Republicans hoping to reclaim New Jersey’s governorship are largely united on how to make New Jersey more affordable.
They want to cut taxes.
Though virtually all five of the GOP candidates to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy support some form of tax cut — whether through rate changes or awards to offset locally set property taxes — they differ some on the details. The primary is June 10.
 Bramnick

State Sen. Jon Bramnick lauded a longstanding Republican proposal to adjust New Jersey’s income tax brackets for inflation to combat a phenomenon called bracket creep.
GOP legislators have argued that because the state’s income tax brackets are not indexed for inflation, residents’ tax rates increase over time with their incomes, cutting into any gains in purchasing power.
Bramnick also suggested simplifying New Jersey’s tax brackets, though he did not detail those proposed changes. He said the combined changes would produce $1,600 in annual savings for joint filers, or $1,000 for single filers.
He also proposed requiring school districts to return excess state aid to their property taxpayers, saying it would lower average residents’ property tax bills by $800. State school aid, pegged for just over $12 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, is funded with income tax revenue.
 Ciattarelli

Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli likewise said he would condense New Jersey’s income tax brackets, adding he would “reduce income taxes for all taxpayers” and introduce exemptions and deductions for home improvements and student loan interest. His platform provides no specifics about either plan.
Ciattarelli, who sought the governor’s seat unsuccessfully in 2017 and 2021, pledged to reduce New Jersey’s corporate business tax rates by five points over as many years. Currently, New Jersey taxes its businesses on non-marginal rates ranging between 6.5% and 9%, depending on net income.
Businesses with more than $10 million in income face an additional 2.5% non-marginal surcharge for what’s called the corporate transit fee (which is intended to fund NJ Transit). Counting the surcharge, New Jersey has the highest state business tax rates in the nation. Without it, the Garden State’s rates are the nation’s fourth highest.
Ciattarelli said he would cap property tax rates to a percentage of a home’s valuation. Statewide, locally set property tax rates in 2024 averaged just over 2.6%, according to Department of Community Affairs data.
Ciattarelli also seeks to reduce state spending by 30%, though it’s not clear what programs he would slash to produce more than $17.4 billion in savings. Gov. Phil Murphy’s budget plan for the next fiscal year calls for about $58.4 billion in spending.
 Spadea

Longtime radio talk show host Bill Spadea’s affordability plan offers few details.
It proposes unspecified cuts to individual and business taxes and cites the large growth in spending under Murphy. Gov. Chris Christie’s final budget called for $35.5 billion in spending for the 2018 fiscal year, 40% smaller than the final budget proposal of Murphy’s second term.
Much of those increases can be attributed to full funding of pension payments and school aid, which together rose by $7.6 billion between Christie’s and Murphy’s final budget proposals.
The roughly 31% in inflation between the two budgets accounts for much of the remainder, though some budget items are not directly tied to rising prices.
 Kranjac

Former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac’s tax plan focuses mainly on property taxes. He said he would seek to cut property taxes, which are locally set, by 2% in each year of his term. The average property New Jersey tax bill was $10,095 in 2024, according to Department of Community Affairs data.
He also said he would seek to cut regulations and business taxes to encourage small business growth but did not provide specifics about either proposal.
 Barbera

Burlington County contractor Justin Barbera has said he would seek to lower taxes for New Jerseyans without children and lower or remove them for seniors, veterans, and those with disabilities.
The details of those proposals are unclear.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)New Jersey lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s special election rules after two sitting members of New Jersey’s House delegation died in office last year, deaths that led each of those seats to remain vacant for five months.
The legislation, which would shorten timelines for special elections to fill House vacancies, comes as another New Jersey member of Congress could step down by next January. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill are among six Democrats competing in June 10’s gubernatorial primary, and if either is victorious in the primary and then in November, they would have to vacate their House seat.
Bill sponsor Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) said the state’s current rules on filling House vacancies need to be changed.
“I thought it was pretty important that we get rid of this so that the people of New Jersey have representation, and if they don’t have it, make sure that gets filled as quickly as possible,” he told the New Jersey Monitor.
He added: “We’ve got two members of Congress … running for governor, so there’s a reasonable likelihood there will be another vacancy starting in January, whenever the transition occurs.”
Sherrill’s and Gottheimer’s Democratic rivals have criticized both of them for putting their seats in jeopardy of being vacant if they win the primary. Republicans have just a two-seat majority in the House.
The Senate’s state government committee on Thursday briefly discussed the New Jersey bill, but it did not vote on it.
Though New Jersey law and the U.S. Constitution allow New Jersey governors to make interim appointments to fill empty Senate seats — as when Gov. Phil Murphy appointed his former chief of staff George Helmy to fill a Senate vacancy after Bob Menendez resigned — the Constitution requires House vacancies to be filled by elections, if they are filled at all.
Presently, New Jersey has three separate structures for filling House vacancies, and timing determines which is used.
If a seat becomes empty at least 70 days before a June primary for any office, the governor is required to order them filled at the next general election, with nominees decided during that primary.
If the seat becomes vacant within the 70 days preceding a primary but more than 70 days from the general election in an odd-numbered year, the governor may — but is not required to — call for the seat to be filled at the state’s next general election. In such cases, a district’s county committee members choose their party’s nominee.
State law also allows the governor to call for special elections — with both primaries and generals — to fill House vacancies. Gov. Phil Murphy called for a special election last year after Rep. Donald Payne Jr.’s April death. Then-Newark City Council President LaMonica McIver won the special primary in July to be the Democratic Party’s nominee and won the special election in September to serve the remainder of Payne’s term (she won election to a full term in November).
Murphy did not call for an election in August when Rep. Bill Pascrell died. Democratic officials picked then-state Sen. Nellie Pou (D-Passaic) to replace him on the November ballot, and she was elected to a full term.
Under current law, when the governor is required to call for a special election, there is no required timeline for them to do so.
“They can keep that seat vacant until the next general election, and they frankly might do that for politics if there’s a razor-thin margin and it’s a Democratic seat, or vice-versa,” bill sponsor state Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) said Thursday.
The bill would require the governor to call for a special election within 10 days of a seat becoming vacant unless there are fewer than 100 days remaining in the unexpired term.
First introduced following Payne’s death, the bill would require special elections — including primaries — to be held between 74 and 80 days after a seat becomes vacant when there are more than 180 days left before the end of the current Congress.
Vacancies incurred with between 100 and 180 days left in the term would be filled by special elections held between 80 and 86 days after the seat becomes vacant. In that case, there would be no special primary, and district county committee members would select parties’ nominees.
If a House seat becomes vacant within 100 days of the end of the congressional term, it would be filled at the next regular election. County committees would select replacements for candidates who die after they’ve been placed on the ballot, as they do under current law.
That timeline especially is condensed by the bill. Under current law, House vacancy races with special primaries can sit empty for more than five months.
“This is now practical as opposed to theoretical. We went through it with the death of Congressman Payne and then the death of Congressman Pascrell,” McKeon said. “We figured out what a nuisance it is, quite frankly, and a nightmare to fill those congressional seats.”
Zwicker said he hoped to have the bill passed before the end of Murphy’s term in early January.
Fears about another vacancy redoubled after Rep. Donald Norcross (D-01) was hospitalized for an infection that turned septic in early April. Norcross was discharged from the hospital after roughly a month following the life-threatening episode.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Following the release of a video showing a North Carolina state trooper and his supervisor agreeing to lie about the police chase that led to the death of Tyrone Mason, attorneys for the family demanded they be fired for their actions.
Renowned civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Bakari Sellers also condemned Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman Thursday after a report from her office indicated she would not seek criminal charges against the troopers despite footage showing State Trooper Garrett Macario denying that he pursued Mason — a false account that was relayed to Mason’s mother.
Crump and Sellers had been pushing for the release of the footage surrounding Mason’s fatal crash in the early morning hours of Oct. 7, 2024 for months. A Wake County Superior Court judge ordered it to be made public on May 16 following a lawsuit that included several newsrooms seeking the videos.
“Now you got the video evidence in your hand, and you refuse to file charges against the killer cops,” Crump told members of the media outside the Wake County Courthouse. “She’s slapping us in our face because she says, ‘I don’t care what evidence you have, it doesn’t matter, I’m still going to take the cop’s word over whatever evidence you have.’”
In an interview Thursday afternoon, Freeman pushed back on these assertions and said Mason’s family and their attorneys are welcome to review the full investigative findings. Though her office declined to prosecute, her office dropped more than 180 cases that would have relied on testimony from the state troopers.
“One of the reasons I opened up this investigation to begin with is that I believe that Mrs. Mason, who had been given the runaround for months, deserved to have the answers of what happened to her son that night,” Freeman said.
A piece of common ground between the Mason family attorneys and Freeman: a belief that the highway patrolmen involved should lose their jobs for misconduct. “I do not believe that these officers should be in law enforcement,” she said.
Henrietta Mason, the mother of Tyrone Mason, brought a civil rights lawsuit against Macario on May 21, citing the false claims about the crash and a failure to render timely aid, which attorneys for the family believe could have saved his life.
“Miss Freeman, you told me to my face you was on my side. You told me you was on my side. But no, you’re on the side of the state troopers, the men that lied,” she said at the press conference. “If they did this to my baby, how many other babies have they did this to?”
‘A bad chase’
In footage released by the State Highway Patrol and Raleigh Police Department, Macario and his supervisor, Sgt. Matthew Morrison, can be heard creating the false account of events, which Macario then relays to Raleigh police.
The footage, which includes both dash camera video from the trooper’s cruiser and body camera video after arriving on the scene, shows Macario pursuing Mason until he crashes into a concrete barrier, around which point Macario appears to turn off his emergency lights and return to the scene from the other direction. Macario said on the call that he “did not feel it was a safe chase.”
“I wouldn’t mention anything to them about you trying to stop him,” Morrison can be heard saying on the call with Macario. “Just say, ‘Hey, man, I drove up on this,’ and leave it at that.”
Five minutes after the call with his supervisor, Macario can be seen on the RPD footage relaying that version of the narrative to officers who subsequently arrived on the scene.

“Were you like pulling him over or something?” Raleigh police officer R. Urena asks in the footage.
“No, this is a little area I work,” Macario answers. “I came up on him and I saw the smoke and heard all the cars hitting the debris.”
That account was then given by Raleigh Police to Henrietta Mason when they informed her of her son’s death — a lie that only unraveled when a witness came forward to tell her he heard the police pursuit, including the deactivation of the trooper’s siren at roughly the same time as the crash.
“You got a video of the officer lying through his teeth,” Crump said. “Not only is he lying, but he’s conspiring — they are conspiring to cover up the crime. They conspire and say, you know, ‘I was chasing him,’ his supervisor says, ‘Well, you don’t want to admit that.’”
Sellers, the lead attorney for the family, said he was also disturbed by Macario’s failure to attempt to render aid to Tyrone Mason. Though Macario witnesses the crash and calls his supervisor immediately afterward, no one checks on Mason’s status until six minutes after it occurs, when Urena and another officer knock on the window and open the driver’s side door.
“We’re not just talking about the lie. We’re not just talking about the obstruction,” Sellers said. “We’re talking about a bad chase and bad policies and bad procedures. We’re talking about a refusal to render aid. We’re talking about the fact that this county lied to this woman month after month after month after month.”
‘The evidence would not support a successful prosecution’
In her report declining to prosecute the troopers, however, district attorney Freeman — who announced earlier this month that she would not seek reelection in 2026 — wrote that while “inexcusable,” Macario and Morrison’s actions do not rise to the level of criminal conduct.
“While their dishonesty violates the standards to which law enforcement officers must adhere, the District Attorney is not pursuing criminal charges as the evidence would not support a successful prosecution,” she wrote. “The District Attorney has shared her concerns about their conduct with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol who has the authority to decide whether they will remain employed.”

According to Freeman’s report, released May 21, Macario subsequently gave a truthful account of the chase to two other members of the Raleigh Police, who confirmed he did so when interviewed. Though there is video footage of Macario speaking with one of the officers who said he told the truth, no audio of that conversation exists. But this account never made it to Henrietta Mason, as the investigator in the case only received the earlier statement.
“[Macario’s] subsequent truthful statements within the relevant time frame prevent the State from being able to move forward with a successful prosecution,” Freeman wrote. “Moreover, evidence would tend to suggest that Sergeant Morrison’s and Trooper Macario’s intent in initially not disclosing the effort to stop Mr. Mason was to keep them from having to manage the crash scene and do the crash reconstruction investigation.”
That conclusion, she said, is evidenced by Morrison’s remark on the video that “it sounds like Raleigh’s problem.”
Henrietta Mason and her attorneys were not satisfied with this outcome, and supporters of the family made Freeman one of the primary targets of their ire at the press conference Thursday. “Lorrin Freeman, Tyrone’s blood is on your hands too!” one demonstrator’s sign read.
“Let me get this straight: You’re going to take the word of a liar, the person you knew just lied, you don’t got no evidence of what he’s saying now, but you’re going to take his word?” Crump asked. “I don’t ever profess to be the smartest guy in the room, but that logic just ain’t logical.”
Freeman said in an interview that while initially, “we were skeptical ourselves” when members of the Raleigh Police came forward to attest that Macario gave them an accurate version of events, there was sufficient evidence to support it, including notes from the night of the crash by a Wake County forensic investigator. In those notes, the investigator records the officer who came forward informing her that a trooper attempted to stop Tyrone Mason prior to the crash.
“We went to great lengths — and that was part of what took so much time in this investigation — to try to nail that down,” Freeman said. “Part of that was finding through the course of that information that shows that Trooper Macario basically tells different stories to different people on the scene.”
‘Justice for Tyrone Mason’
Despite the lack of a criminal prosecution, Sellers and Crump vowed to continue pursuing justice for Tyrone Mason and his family through the courts, primarily through the ongoing lawsuit against Macario.
Sellers said the revelation of “how grossly negligent the Raleigh Police Department has been” means that they may pursue legal action against them as well. He told members of the media Thursday that they will be filing a notice of claim against RPD, which is a prerequisite for seeking damages.
The Raleigh Police Department did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Sellers said Raleigh Police Chief Rico Boyce offered to meet with Henrietta Mason, but she and her attorneys declined in light of the meeting with the district attorney.
In her report, Freeman wrote that she relayed concerns over handling of the incident to both the State Highway Patrol and the Raleigh Police Department, and is also providing the findings to the North Carolina Criminal Justice Training and Standards Division, the body that certifies members of law enforcement.
The State Highway Patrol is also still pursuing an internal review of the crash and aftermath, and Macario and Morrison remain on administrative leave, according to Department of Public Safety spokesperson Christopher Knox, who called Mason’s death a “heartbreaking occurrence.”
“We do recognize and take ownership that words spoken and captured by video in the moments after the collision’s occurrence do not reflect the high standards we place upon our members nor the lifesaving work that we see them carry out daily,” Knox wrote. “We do believe, however, that this collision was a result of Mr. Mason’s actions alone and that is reflected in the unbiased collision report completed by the Raleigh Police Department.”

Rev. Gregory Drumwright, an activist with Justice 4 the Next Generation who prayed over the press conference, said in his view, this case has “redefined what the purpose of police wearing body-worn cameras is.”
“Somebody tell me, if we are not going to use as evidence the truth, transparency, and undisputable facts that audio and video presents, then what is the purpose of body-worn cameras in the first place?” Drumwright asked. “Why did they have the cameras on if they can lie thinking the cameras is off and still get away with their lies?”
Also speaking in support of the family’s efforts was state Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Durham), who said she plans to use her position to push for greater oversight and probe more deeply into the circumstances of the case.
“We have a right to make a justice system that was not built for us to see us, hear us, and hold it accountable,” Murdock said. “We will continue to ensure that Tyrone Mason gets the justice that he deserves. His life mattered and had value, and we will continue to lift up his name.”
In addition to law enforcement, Sellers expressed disappointment in top elected officials for not putting their weight behind the case. Calling Governor Josh Stein and Attorney General Jeff Jackson “two very good friends” of his, he lamented that neither had spoken out about Tyrone Mason’s death. “Their silence is not just deafening, but their silence is acquiescence,” he said.
Spokespeople for Jackson and Stein did not respond to requests for comment.
Crump said all Henrietta Mason is seeking is “simple justice,” something that should not require such extreme lengths to receive.
“We always believed that if we had it on video where they could see it and hear it, that Black people would have a chance at equal justice,” Crump said. “Don’t say no more, look at the video — and that’s our case.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5291996-scaled-e1748565446154-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) argues Thursday in the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee for including the full budget request from the state Department of Safety and Professional Services in the 2025-27 Wisconsin state budget. (Screenshot/WisEye)Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee rejected a proposal Thursday to add permanent staff to the state agency responsible for ensuring that a range of professionals have licenses they need to do their jobs.
Instead, the Joint Finance Committee voted along party lines to extend five contract positions for three more years as well as add a handful of other positions.
The 2025-27 state budget marks the fourth one in which Gov. Tony Evers has been rebuffed after urging lawmakers to increase staffing at the Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS) to speed up the agency’s license and permit administration.
There was no debate during the 45-minute meeting Thursday.
All four Democrats on the committee spoke up, either to advocate for their proposal for the agency or to criticize the GOP proposal as inadequate. None of the Republicans, however, made arguments for their plan for DSPS or against the Democrats’ alternative.
In addition to issuing professional licenses in health care, personal services, professions such as accounting or architecture and for skilled tradespeople such as plumbers and electricians, DSPS also oversees a variety of building and other public safety licenses and permits.
Starting more than three years ago, Republican lawmakers raised criticism of the agency amid heavy backlogs in the licensing process for a wide range of professionals.  
Democratic lawmakers — as well as some outside groups representing licensed professionals — have charged the backlog was a result of the Legislature’s failure to authorize more positions at the department.
The department is almost entirely self-funded through the fees it collects from license applications, but the size of its staff requires the approval of the Legislature.  
In the 2023-25 draft state budget, Evers requested 74 new positions at DSPS, but the final spending plan drafted largely by the Republican majority on the finance committee added 17.75 positions.
Evers redirected pandemic relief funds to DSPS to hire more contract workers to help manage the licensing process. In the last couple of years, the backlog has been reduced so that on average a license is issued in two weeks, according to state Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay), a finance committee member.
In his 2025-27 budget draft, Evers requested 30 new positions at the agency. On Thursday, Democrats on the finance committee proposed adding 31 positions, including 14 to staff the department’s call center serving license applicants and nine additional employees to process license applications.
Authorizing fewer people than DSPS has requested “has a tremendous risk of causing significant delays or or even just making it a little bit harder for people to be able to get their license,” said Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha). “We want people to be able to get the licenses that they need so they can go to work. We want people to get the renewals that they need so they can continue working.”
State law requires about 10% of the fee revenue from professional licenses in health and business professions to be transferred to the state budget’s general fund.
“We have been pulling funds out of an agency that’s almost basically self-sufficient and dumping the money into the general fund, all while the demand for licenses is exploding,” said Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee).
Johnson warned the committee that if the licensing process gets bogged down again, shortages in fields such as health care in particular are likely to worsen.
Falling short of funding the department’s full request “impacts every single person in the state, whether you’re a licensee or not,” said Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison). “What we are doing is starving that system and making it harder for every single one of us to access needed professional services.”
The Democratic proposal failed on a 4-12 vote, with all the Republicans on the 16-member committee voting against it. 
The Republican measure passed 12-4, with only Republicans’ support.
It extends five contract call center positions that expire Sept. 30 for another three years.
The GOP motion omits three lawyers and three paralegals the department had requested for professional regulation compliance and for the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.
The motion also transfers $5 million from DSPS revenues to the state budget’s general fund, in addition to the annual 10% from license fees. 
The Republican measure authorizes a consultant for pharmacy inspections that was part of the original budget draft. It also includes funding to continue a youth firefighter training grant that was in the original request and the Democratic proposal.
The committee’s co-chairs, Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam), released a joint statement later Thursday declaring that “Joint Finance Republicans voted to invest in important government services while holding the line on spending.”
The statement cited funding for DSPS call center staff “to help credential holders and the public navigate licensure platforms” and said the funding “ensures the department can operate effectively and provide these critical services to professionals.”
Immediately after the final vote, however, Andraca told her colleagues that the outcome was a missed opportunity.
“We could be sitting here claiming a bipartisan success story, because today the median time to get a license is only 15 days,” Andraca said. “We should be continuing the success story and taking a victory lap, and instead we’re chipping away the progress that we’ve made — and that’s very disappointing.”

Co-President Jean Henscheid said members of the league tried working for weeks with the Idaho State Tax Commission and Little’s office to create a public awareness campaign around the new Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit.

The law has been effective for nearly six months. Henscheid said members of the league felt it was important to try to facilitate a discussion or public forum on how families can participate in the tax credit and how accountability will work.
“Over the course of the 80 years we have been active in Idaho we have provided dozens, if not hundreds, of opportunities for public education events including candidate forums, roundtable discussions, community events asking people what they think of particular polices and providing them with the kind of information they need to be informed voters,” Henscheid said.
“Even in its embryonic state, there is enough interest in this $50 million initiative that we felt it would be a service to the public to offer and to facilitate it, which is what the league has done for 80 years,” Henscheid said.

  State still working out details on tax credit program that would allow public dollars for private schooling 

Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Idaho State Tax Commission said the state does not yet have answers to many of the questions the League of Women Voters of Idaho gathered for a public awareness campaign. 
“We’re still working out the details of the Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit program,” Idaho State Tax Commission public information officer Renee Eymann said Wednesday. “This is a complex piece of legislation, and we want to have the correct information available.”
The law creating the tax credit has already taken effect. House Bill 93 was written so that it took effect retroactively on Jan. 1, 2025. 
The new credit in House Bill 93 provides up to a $5,000 refundable tax credit for qualifying education expenses, including tuition at a private, religious school. Under the law, parents, guardians or foster parents can receive the credit for qualified expenses such as private school tuition and fees.
Eymann said officials with the Idaho State Tax Commission are still:

Reviewing the definitions as they relate to taxes
Looking at the reporting requirements so the commission can roll them into the application process
Determining the commission’s administrative duties and how they’ll align with the law’s requirements

Henscheid said the league was open to all sorts of ideas for a public forum or public awareness campaign – including a town hall event, a webinar, a literature campaign or a Q&A of some format.
“If they thought meeting on aisle 12 at Walmart and talking to people about it would help, we would have done it, Henscheid said. 
 Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed new tax credit into law 

During his Jan. 6 State of the State address Little said: “I recognize the growing desire to expand school choice, especially for students with unique physical or developmental conditions.”
Little then recommended spending $50 million “to further expand education options for Idaho families,” and he signed House Bill 93 into law on Feb. 27.

For this article, Little’s office referred questions about the Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit and the League of Women Voters of Idaho’s outreach efforts to the Idaho State Tax Commission.
Parents will be able to apply for the new Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit on Jan. 15, 2026, Eymann said. 
Once the Idaho State Tax Commission has the details and requirements of the new law sorted out, officials will seek to share those details with the public, the commission said.
“As we finalize more information, we’ll be sharing it with all groups that are willing to help us spread the word,” Eymann said. “This will include issuing news releases, compiling frequently asked questions, providing steps on how to fill out the application for the credit, and explaining what 300% below poverty level means.”

 



 A list of some of the questions the League of Women Voters of Idaho gathered from the public this spring 

Financial Information

How do tax credits work in general? Are there examples similar to the Parental Choice Tax Credit Program?
Will the same system used for determining qualified expenses through the Empowering Parents grants be used for the Parental Choice Tax Credit Program? Who will be responsible for determining the eligibility of individual family expenses (e.g. qualified instructional materials or travel)? Will the Empowering Parents grants program process be combined with this process? Will levels of compliance and noncompliance be reported publicly (see also accountability Question #23 below)
Can families who do not file taxes apply?
Could you clarify the following: Parents seeking an advanced payment may also receive a tax credit in the same year. Is that correct? Does that mean one student could receive as much as $10,000 or $15,000 during the first year of eligibility?
Is there a limit to the number of children per household who may be eligible for the tax credit?
Will a student who registers for an enrichment program, after school activity, or music lesson through a public school, public charter school, public virtual charter school, public magnet school, or part-time public kindergarten while they are using the tax credit forfeit the entire credit for that term? How will this impact future applications? Who will be tasked with tracking ineligible enrollment and recovering the tax credit?
Will a nonpublic school that disenrolls a student during an academic term in which a tax credit is being used retain the tax credit funds? If not, will the remaining funds be returned to the state or to parents? Who will be tasked with tracking this?
Will a closing nonpublic school receiving tax credit funds retain those funds or return the remainder to the parents? Do closing nonpublic schools have any obligations to enrolled students using the tax credit funds?

Application Process

What information will be required on the application form?
How was the 60-day application window determined? Is this like other programs?
Will parents whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed 300% of the federal poverty level have an early window during the 60 days to apply? If not, how will the preference process work?
The law says parents who are reapplying will be given preference over parents who qualify under the federal poverty level criteria. This seems to shift the program’s priorities from the first year. Is this correct?
Will parents have someone to help them through the application process?

Student Learning

The law states that tax credits may be used to cover academic instruction in English language arts, mathematics, science, and social science. Who will be tasked with verifying (and reverifying) that these subjects are taught? Will it be a self-report by the school?
Who will be tasked with defining a portfolio of evidence or learning record that indicates the student’s growth? Will this be up to each school? Will portfolios and learning records be housed at the Tax Commission? If so, will they be secured? Does the student retain ownership of the intellectual property in these documents? Who will conduct the audit of these records to establish that the instruction meets the requirements listed in Question 14 above? What does “sufficient” evidence for an audit mean?

Accountability

Could you tell us more about what is meant by an “accredited” school?
How will parents reapplying for the program certify that they have completed the mandatory satisfaction and engagement survey? What evidence will be required?
Will someone be tasked with ensuring that students with disabilities are receiving services under 20 U.S.C. 1412 of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act?
Will parents of students with disabilities have an advocate who will help students get the help they need?
What remedy will be applied if the Tax Commission determines that services mandated by federal law are not provided by the nonpublic school to students with disabilities?
The law states that its provisions shall not be construed to permit any government agency to exercise control or supervision over any nonpublic school student and nonpublic schools shall not be required to alter their creeds, practices, admissions policies, or curriculum in order to accept students using parental choice tax credits. Are remedies through the state available to parents if schools fail to comply with the disabilities education act or are identified through the satisfaction and engagement survey as failing in their duty to students?
Do the Legislature, Governor’s Office, or Tax Commission constitute government entities not permitted to control or supervise nonpublic school students or impact creeds, practices, admissions policies, or curriculum of nonpublic schools? If not, why is this the case?
Which state employee or employees will be responsible for developing the mandatory satisfaction and engagement survey? Will results be available to participating parents, nonpublic schools, or other stakeholder groups outside the Tax Commission, the governor, and relevant legislative leadership and committees? Will results be made available to the public as state-generated documents? Will results be analyzed? If yes, by whom and for what purpose? Will results be used to improve the program, the nonpublic schools, or student learning? Will results of the annual program report to the governor and relevant legislative leadership and committees be made public and/or used to inform program improvement?

Another agency, which previously occupied the now-vacant work areas within view of the door, relocated years ago. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tippecanoe County resident Pamela Frazee just wants to know if her messages went through.
Phone calls to Indiana’s Office of the Public Access Counselor (PAC) route directly to a voicemail box and aren’t returned. Emails — including allegations of public access law violations that the office weighs in on — go unacknowledged. No opinions from this year are online.
Frustrated Hoosiers report the office has gone mum after a leadership shake-up.
“It’s not been a good transition at all if you don’t even have people who can answer the phones,” said Frazee, who sought confirmation that her time-sensitive complaints were received.
Former PAC Luke Britt, who ran the office for about 12 years under previous Govs. Mike Pence and Eric Holcomb, announced plans to resign mid-February, WFYI reported. In late March, new Gov. Mike Braun named Indianapolis attorney Jennifer Ruby as the successor. The office has one other employee, Kyra Helming, listed in the state’s transparency portal.
Britt, the state’s longest-serving PAC, pointed to an “overwhelming” workload in a niche area of law.

“I don’t envy what she’s having to deal with right now at all,” he said. “It’s not my place to give her the benefit of the doubt. But I certainly do.”
Braun’s administration, meanwhile, pinned blame on him.
“When Gov. Braun’s public access counselor appointment began in March, she inherited dozens of cases from 2024 that were not finalized,” Governor’s Office spokesman Griffin Reid said. “With that backlog successfully addressed, she is focusing her efforts on the 2025 cases and the statutory responsibilities of the office. Gov. Braun is fully committed to transparency at all levels.”
The Capital Chronicle requested comment from Ruby’s office May 9 and in the past week, but didn’t receive a response from her. No one answered the door when reporters showed up.
The PAC provides guidance on state public records and open meeting laws. The officeholder responds to informal inquiries on the laws, issues non-binding advisory opinions and educates officials and Hoosiers on their rights and responsibilities, according to the website.
The Indiana General Assembly created the office in 1999.
Keeping up
For Frazee, who filed two formal complaints mid-May and hasn’t heard back, the “PAC clock is ticking.”
Formal complaints must be filed with the office within 30 days of either an agency’s denial of records access or notice of an improperly held meeting. A complaint is considered filed on the date it is received, according to the office’s public access law handbook. Once a complaint is accepted, the PAC notifies the alleged offending agency and gives it 20 business days to respond.
“Do I need to resend it? Did you assign it? Did you toss it?” Frazee worried.
She said a confirmation that a filing has been received — “always” sent during Britt’s tenure — would provide reassurance “that I have submitted the PAC complaint in a timely fashion, where I don’t have to worry about it being tossed.”
Keeping up with demand proved a challenge, per Britt.
The workload grew annually, “sometimes by an exponential amount.” And “volume-wise, it was even overwhelming for me at times, just trying to keep it all straight, be responsive,” he recalled.
He said “constituent relations” — responding to Hoosier queries — was his top priority and became his workday.
An influx of 50-100 calls and emails were coming in daily by the time he left, Britt estimated. He described a “benchmark” for getting messages answered within 24 business hours.
Hoosier lawmakers decline to remove public records chief restrictions

“If I had time, or I would take work home in the evenings, to actually write opinions,” he continued. Legislation that went into effect last July “de-emphasized opinions even more, so I would try to resolve those conflicts informally as much as I could.”
House Enrolled Act 1338 limited the PAC to using only the law’s “plain text” — despite statutory ambiguities — and official court orders in writing opinions. Also, the governor can now remove a PAC at any time, instead of “for cause.”
He still wrote opinions, though — and imposed a benchmark for them, too.
The goal was to have all of of the the previous year’s opinions done before the first quarter of the next year ended. By the time he left, Britt said, he’d distributed the 2024 opinions but hadn’t uploaded them online; he hadn’t started on the 2025 complaints.
His longtime deputy or an administrative assistant would usually handle tasks like uploading opinions. (Only about half those written are uploaded, according to a formal complaint guide.) But both staffers left partway through 2024, as the term-limited Holcomb administration neared its end. Britt said that’s when the office fell behind on uploads.
He ran the agency solo for nearly a year. Then he resigned.
“I was worried when I left that there would be a lot of loose ends,” Britt said. “There was a lot of work in progress. There always was. No matter when I left, I knew … I couldn’t even begin to wrap everything up with a bow. I did what I could and tried to leave behind as many breadcrumbs as I could, but there was just too much.”
He estimated leaving behind 11 pending complaints and recalled Ruby mentioning the backlog had grown to about 40.

(Photo by Trawick Images/Getty Images)The oil and gas industry is a major economic engine in Oklahoma, contributing significantly to jobs and tax revenue. But, we are paying for this lucrative driver of our economy with environmental degradation and harm to community health.
And unfortunately our state and federal leaders have continued to have little interest in passing regulations governing the industry that would protect public health despite first being alerted to risks over four decades ago.
Leaders first became aware of the threat to public health in 1982 when the American Petroleum Institute’s Committee for Environmental Biology and Community Health issued a report  that highlighted the fact that materials of interest to the oil and gas industry “contain measurable quantities of radionuclides” in equipment, product streams or waste.
Every stage of production can produce what is known as “technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material,” or TENORM.
During oil and gas drilling, radioactive elements are carried to the surface. And radioactive elements are often present in the massive volumes of wastewater produced by a working oil or gas well.
Currently, there are no dedicated federal regulations to ensure comprehensive and safe management of radioactive oil and gas materials. The industry was granted a federal exemption in 1980 that legally defined its waste as nonhazardous, despite containing toxic chemicals, carcinogens, heavy metals, and radioactivity.
This leaves Oklahomans reliant on state regulations and oversight, which unfortunately, are spotty at best.
Oklahoma has no general radiation provisions and therefore does not regulate TENORM waste. This lack of regulation means there are no specific rules in place to control the disposal or handling of this waste, potentially leading to exposure risks for workers and residents.
If this TENORM is not adequately managed and disposed of, it poses significant health threats to oil and gas workers, their families and nearby residents. That health risk includes the increased risk of cancer. Through mismanagement, waste can leak out of storage pits, tanks, and landfills or spill during transportation. It is sometimes purposely spread over land and mixed with the soil in an industrial waste management practice known as “land farming.” Wastewater may be used for dust suppression or deicing roads.
A 2021 paper published in the journal “Energy Economics” examined two decades of data from 76 Oklahoma counties.
The authors found that an increase in the number of fracked wells led to a statistically significant reduction in life expectancy. They also noted increases in those county’s mortality and rates of cancer, cardiac diseases, and respiratory diseases.
The industry is trying to pivot now toward the treatment of oilfield waste, but the problem is that if you remove the radioactive heavy metals that are already at elevated levels, you just concentrate them.
There are also very limited ways to dispose of the wastewater, and the chief method is injection wells, which account for 96% of disposal.
Oklahoma has over 10,600 such wells. Unfortunately, injection wells pose their own set of problems. The U.S. Geological Survey has linked them to earthquakes. In Oklahoma, earthquakes have increased 900-fold since 2008, when fracking became more prevalent.
Some of these wells are also now leaking their waste back to the surface across America. If deep formations fail to contain the toxic waste injected into them, that waste can migrate and end up in shallow freshwater aquifers.
Despite the potential environmental and health threats few municipalities have strong ordinances to protect residents from these sites and an injection site may be permitted with little to no community knowledge or involvement.
Is it any wonder that Oklahoma has such poor health outcomes, including the fourth highest cancer death rate in the country?
If lawmakers really want to improve Oklahoma’s lagging health outcomes, perhaps new laws governing the oil and gas industry’s disposal processes would be a place to start.

Job Corps, Head Start and Trio among programs targeted for cuts that would have major implications for reservation communities, tribal representatives and others told lawmakers. “It’s very scary,” a superintendent said.
The post Threatened federal funding for education, workforce programs spark concern among Wyoming tribes appeared first on WyoFile .","A national narrative that Job Corps isn’t working couldn’t be further from the truth in central Wyoming, according to Jared Baldes, a field director and former carpentry instructor at Wind River Job Corps in Riverton. 
In a region of the state where high school dropout rates are high and traditional college paths aren’t the norm, Baldes said, Wind River Job Corps creates a viable pipeline for students to enter the workforce and earn high wages and good benefits. It helps keep youths out of the juvenile justice system, and is an important avenue for Wind River Indian Reservation youth.  
“Just in my trade alone, I’ve placed 15 students this year into jobs, six of them Native American,” Baldes told members of the Legislature’s Select Committee on Tribal Affairs last week. “So the national narrative that Job Corps isn’t working is very wrong. Job Corps is working, and it’s very effective, and it’s changing lives.”
Now, however, the free career training program for low-income young adults is in danger. The Trump administration proposed a significant cut to the Job Corps program following an initial call to eliminate funding entirely. The U.S. Department of Labor announced Thursday it will pause operations at contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide.
“It would be very unfortunate not to be able to continue that pipeline to small businesses and businesses around the state for these young men and women being trained by very good instructors,” Baldes said. 
Job Corps’ demise was among a chorus of warning bells rung during the meeting last week in Fort Washakie. Though the topic was not on the agenda, tribal representatives repeatedly raised worries that federal funding could end or decline for programs vital to Native communities.

The tenor underscored deep trepidation about impacts that could ripple from federal efforts to cut spending.  
Wind River Job Corps has clearly been a positive force in the state, committee member Rep. Ivan Posey, D-Fort Washakie, said. He remembered cedaring the dorms with his brother when the facility opened.
“I hope that [Wyoming’s congressional] delegation realizes that it’s been a boon to our economy here, and that it’s been a good thing for us,” he said. “It changes people’s lives.”
Education 
School leaders are keeping close watch on potential cuts that could impact tribal education, they told the committee. 
Though the Trump administration has apparently backed away from a proposal to eliminate Head Start funding, the threat remains, Eastern Shoshone Business Council Wayland Large said. 
“On this reservation, each district has a Head Start  — one in Fort Washakie, Ethete and Arapahoe,” Large said. The program, which is under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides early childhood education, health, nutrition and parent services to low-income families with children from birth to age 5.
Fremont County School District 38 Superintendent Curt Mayer, meanwhile, said his district is concerned about Impact Aid funding. That federal program provides financial assistance to local school districts with concentrations of children living on tribal lands as well as military bases and other federal property. 
District 38 officials travel to Washington, D.C. twice a year to secure the funding, Mayer said, which is used to fund counselors, nurses, school resource officers and cultural staff in the Arapahoe schools.

Deb Smith, superintendent of the Fort Washakie Schools in Fremont County School District 21, echoed that concern. 
“Impact Aid is huge for us,” Smith said. “So we’ve all been very worried about the funding, if it’s going to be there in the future.”
Committee chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, asked about other implications. 
“It seems that the situation is evolving with respect to our federal partners in education,” Case said, “and I’m wondering what kind of implications are there, for example, with the elimination of the Department of Education?”
If the DOE goes away, Smith said, the hope is that Impact Aid can survive in a different federal department. Other areas of concern include federal funding for free and reduced lunch programs, Title I funds that help schools with high percentages of low-income students and similar programs.  
“We can’t provide some of the programming and resources without that funding,” she said. “And it’s scary. It’s very scary.”
Lawmakers listened sympathetically to Smith and others’ concerns but remained relatively mum. 
Higher ed
Central Wyoming College in Riverton has the state’s largest Trio Program, CWC President Dr. Brad Tyndall told the committee. The federal program offers outreach and services designed to provide pre-college services for people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
There are roughly 650 eligible students in the CWC service area, Tyndall said, and the college works with them by going through the high schools to identify and help students.  
“The recommendation from the White House budget is to cut all of that, and that would be devastating to our community, and especially our Native Americans, but it would be everybody,” he said. “The economic impact to the state is huge, and begs the question: ‘What do we do if that money goes away as a state?’”
College officials are also concerned about Native American-Serving Nontribal Institutions Program, or NASNTI, grants, Tyndall said, which are on hold. 
“But NASNTI is kind of dwarfed by Trio,” he said.

The college is also concerned about some changes to the Pell Grant availability in the federal budget bill, CWC Vice President of Student Affairs Coralina Daly said. 
The changes would require students to take 15 credits per semester. 
With many at-risk students, she said, taking 12 credits “is a significant load already. To ask them to take another class is really impeding their ability to be successful.”
There also is a proposal to cut Pell for part-time students, she added, “so all of these students that we know who are working and have these other obligations are going to have less access to aid.” 
Federal work study is also slated to be canceled in the budget bill, she said. “So that is another opportunity that would go away.” 
Of the funding coming to CWC’s self-identified tribal students, Daly said, “71% of those funds are coming from federal sources. That is disproportionately larger than our overall population.
“I think it’s important to note those federal funds are incredibly important for our tribal students,” she said. 
The federal budget bill, officially called the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, passed the U.S. House last week. It must still clear the Senate.
Uncertainty
Other areas of concern included Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which are both targeted for cuts. 
Conversations during the committee meeting also highlighted a high level of confusion related to when or how federal money will come through, the fact that some funds that were frozen have been released and if and how court intervention will impact programs.

For example, staff in the federal department that oversees the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIEAP, were eliminated this spring, spurring worries that the program would end. 
“It does help our elders and the community with the gas and the lights,” Eastern Shoshone Business Council member Latonna Snyder said. “So that’s a big issue.”
However, LIEAP in Wyoming has been funded through September, the Wyoming Department of Family Services announced this spring, adding that for the time being, no changes were anticipated.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – Republican leaders in the Michigan Legislature say they plan to support an initiative to hold a constitutional convention to rewrite the document.
The proposal automatically appears on the ballot every 16 years. The November 2026 general election will be the fourth time since the state’s current governing document, which went into effect in 1963, that voters decide whether to go back to the drawing board.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said he does think we need a “Con-Con.”
“They stuff so many things in this Constitution, all kinds of things, every time,” Hall said, pointing to ballot proposals legalizing marijuana and creating an independent redistricting commission that were approved by voters as examples.
“Some of those proposals sounded good, but then had intentions that the public is frustrated about,” Hall said.
While Hall was focused on taking things out of the state’s constitution, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) sees it as an opportunity to make updates that he said Lansing leaders haven’t had the “political courage … to actually get done.”
Those include making the state superintendent an appointment of the governor rather than of the state Board of Education, as well as changes to how university boards are selected.
“I think there’s a lot of things that should be discussed,” Nesbitt, who is running for governor, said. “And the constitution could be a lot simpler than what it is right now.”
That simplification could touch all aspects of the state’s guiding document.
Eric Lupher,  president of the nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan, previously told the Michigan Advance that if a constitutional convention were to be approved, “everything is fair game, from Article One through Article 12, so it’s not a piecemeal approach. It is an open document that will be examined from A-to-Z.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said she hasn’t given it much thought but is open to hearing pros and cons.
House Minority Leader Ranjeev Puri (D-Canton) said he wasn’t familiar with specifics of the proposal but that it didn’t sound like something he would support.
If voters did call a constitutional convention, a special primary and general election for delegates would be held, with one delegate elected in each of the state’s 110 state House and 38 state Senate districts.
The convention would convene in October 2027 with no limit on how long it would last before proposing a new constitution, which voters would either approve or reject.
The legislative leaders were speaking during a Detroit Regional Chamber PAC reception during the final night of the Mackinac Policy Conference.
The unusually tense reception marked the first meeting of the four so-called “quadrant” leaders, representing the four key positions in the Michigan House and Senate, with no quadrant meetings having been held since last year.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)
Brinks said the Democratic majority in the Senate is willing to work with the Republican majority in the House on priorities like transparency reform and long-term road funding.
She said that starts by having more regular conversations.
“It’s important for us to sit down and negotiate the differences,” Brinks said. “That’s how the Legislature works, and it’s particularly important when we have a Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate to sit down and just hash out those differences.”
Puri said it should be easy to set up plans for another meeting, pulling out his phone and saying he has time next Tuesday at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
But Hall said he doesn’t need to meet with the other legislative leaders, arguing that the House is getting things done on their own, though the state has seen just four bills signed into law so far this year.
Hall pointed to an Epic-MRA poll saying he has a 60% approval rating as evidence that his current strategy is working.
But Puri said the polling numbers aren’t indicative of the state’s actual perspectives.
“I congratulate the Speaker on his polling numbers. Contrary to what you’re saying, that was not statewide in Michigan, that was a select few lobbyists and Lansing insiders telling you that you’re doing a great job,” Puri said. “I don’t get my validation by pleasing lobbyists, and I see some in the room, I’m sorry. My validation is waking up to a family that loves me.”
Hall said he does work well with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, citing a positive vision while criticizing Brinks and Puri for offering a negative vision.
“I would encourage the Democrat leaders to empower your governor, Gretchen Whitmer,” Hall said. “Empower her in negotiations, and her and I will get a deal done, and we’ll get it done very quickly, on the budget, on roads, on many things.”

Ron Johnson at the Newsroom Pub on Wednesday, May 28, 2025 | Photo by Ruth Conniff/Wisconsin ExaminerYou have to hand it to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. As Republicans across the country run in fear from their constituents, refusing to hold town halls lest they be asked to answer for brutal federal budget cuts and threats to health care, nutrition assistance and Social Security, Johnson showed up at a Milwaukee Press Club event Wednesday and appeared cheerfully unperturbed as he took questions from journalists and a skeptical crowd. Not that his answers made sense.
People sitting in front of the podium at the Newsroom Pub luncheon crossed their arms and furrowed their brows as Johnson explained his alternative views on everything from global warming to COVID-19 to the benefits of bringing the federal budget more in line with the spending levels of 1930 — i.e. the beginning of the Great Depression, before FDR instituted New Deal programs Johnson described as “outside [the president’s] constitutionally enumerated powers.”
A handful of protesters chanted in the rain outside the Newsroom Pub, but overall, the event was cordial and reactions muted. In part, this was attributable to Johnson’s Teflon cockiness and the barrage of misinformation he happily unleashed, which had a numbing effect on his audience. 
Johnson fancies himself a “numbers guy.” In that way he’s a little like former House Speaker Paul Ryan, his fellow Wisconsin Republican who was once considered the boy genius of the GOP. Ryan made it safe to talk about privatizing Medicare by touring the country with a PowerPoint presentation full of charts and graphs, selling optimistic projections of the benefits of trickle-down economics, corporate tax cuts and the magic of the private market. But Ryan couldn’t stomach Trump and he’s been exiled from the party. Johnson is the MAGA version. While he doesn’t dazzle anyone with his brilliance, he does a good job of baffling his opponents with a barrage of B.S. that leaves even seasoned journalists scrambling to figure out what question to ask. Where do you begin?
Back in 2021, YouTube removed a video of Johnson’s Milwaukee Press Club appearance because he violated the platform’s community standards by spreading dangerous lies about COVID, the alleged harm caused by vaccines and the supposed benefits of dubious remedies. 
But this week he was back, proudly endorsing DHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate federal COVID vaccine recommendations for pregnant women and healthy children. While he hopes Kennedy goes further in rolling back vaccinations, he said, “at least we’re not going to subject our children to them anymore.”
A woman in the audience who identified herself as a local business owner seeking “common ground” thanked Johnson for saying “we don’t want to mortgage our children’s future,” but expressed her concern that besides the deficit spending Johnson rails against, there’s also the risk that we’re mortgaging the future by destroying the planet.
Johnson heartily agreed that everyone wants a “pristine environment.” “I mean, I love the outdoors,” he declared. But then he added, “We shouldn’t spend a dime on climate change. We’ll adapt. We’re very adaptable.” 
He claimed that “something like 1,800 different scientists and business leaders” have signed a statement saying there is no climate crisis. (The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that climate change is real and caused by people and the statement he referred to has been debunked.) “So if it’s climate change you’re talking about, we’re just at cross-purposes,” he added. “I completely disagree.”
Most of Johnson’s talk consisted of a fusillade of hard-to-follow budget numbers and nostrums like “the more the government spends the less free we are.” Charles Benson of TMJ4 News tried to get the senator to focus on what it would take to get him to go along with Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill. “So, a lot of numbers out there,” Benson said. “Can you give me a bottom line? Do you want 2 trillion? 3 trillion?”
“Your reaction is the exact same reaction I get from the White House and from my colleagues,” Johnson chided, “too many numbers. It’s a budget process. We’re talking about numbers. We’re talking about mortgaging our kids’ future.” 
Like his alternative beliefs about vaccination and climate science, Johnson’s budget math is extremely fuzzy. He asserted, repeatedly, that Medicaid is rife with “waste, fraud and abuse.” But the Georgetown University School of Public Policy has published a policy analysis dismantling claims that there is rampant waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid that concluded, “This premise is false, and the thinking is dangerously wrong.”
More broadly, Johnson claims that balancing the budget and reducing the federal deficit is his No. 1 concern. But he’s committed to maintaining historic tax cuts for the super rich. The only way to reduce deficits, in his view, is to enact even deeper cuts than House Republicans passed, increasing hunger, undermining education and rolling back health care — because he’s totally unwilling to increase revenue with even modest tax increases on corporations and the very wealthy. Those cuts, not a deficit that could be resolved by making the rich pay their share of taxes, are the real threat to our children’s future.
“I’m just a guy from Oshkosh who’s trying to save America,” Johnson said at the Press Club event. He recapped, in heroic terms, his lone stand against the 2017 tax cut for America’s top earners, which he blocked until he was able to work in a special loophole that benefitted him personally.
He told the panel of Wisconsin journalists he will also block Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill unless he sees deeper cuts, which he insisted would be easy to make. The 40 states that have taken the federal Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act (which Johnson still calls “Obamacare”) are “stealing money from federal taxpayers,” he declared. Slashing Medicaid will be easy, he suggested, since “nobody would be harmed other than the grifters who are sucking down the waste, fraud and abuse.”
Grifters?
Wisconsin has 1.3 million Medicaid recipients. One in three children are on BadgerCare, as Medicaid is called here, along with 45% of adults with disabilities and 55% of seniors living in nursing homes. Our state program faces a $16.8 billion cut over 10 years under the House plan. During the Q&A session, I asked Johnson about this — not just the numbers, but the human cost. I brought up Shaniya Cooper, a college student from Milwaukee and a BadgerCare recipient living with lupus, who spoke at a press conference in the Capitol this week about how scary it was to realize she could lose her Medicaid coverage under congressional Republicans’ budget plan. 
“To me, this is life or death,” she said. She simply cannot afford to pay for her medicine out of pocket. When she first learned about proposed Medicaid cuts, “I cried,” she said. “I felt fear and dread.”
What does Johnson have to say to Cooper and other BadgerCare recipients who are terrified of losing their coverage?
“I’ll go back to my basic point,” Johnson replied. He quoted Elon Musk, whom he said he greatly admires for his DOGE work slashing federal agencies. “If we don’t fix this, we won’t have money for any of this [government in general],” he said Musk told him.
“Nobody wants the truly vulnerable to lose those benefits of Medicaid,” Johnson added. “But again, Obamacare expanded the waste, fraud and abuse of Medicaid, you know, expanding the people on it when, you know, when a lot of these people ought to be really getting a job.”
Some of Johnson’s Republican colleagues are worried about withdrawing health care coverage from millions of their constituents. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called it immoral and “political suicide.” He said he won’t vote for the Medicaid cuts that passed the House because they will put rural hospitals out of business, and because too many hard-working, low-income people rely on the program for health coverage and simply cannot afford to buy insurance on the private market. 
But Johnson remains untroubled. He’s pushing for bigger and more damaging cuts. And when asked what he can tell his constituents who are afraid they’re about to lose life-saving health care, his answer is simple and unapologetic: Get a job.

To […]","Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Montana, speaks to Kaitlan Collins on CNN about the Trump tariffs, confirming that Americans will feel economic pain (Screenshot CNN). It hasn’t been a good week for the guy who decided he was going to be a king and spent his first four months in office ignoring the law, declaring phony “national emergencies” and issuing “royal edicts” disguised as executive orders. 
But things didn’t go exactly as he hoped — to put it mildly.
To start, Wall Street, which has been wracked by his on again-off again tariffs, came up with a new moniker for him:  TACO.  That stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out” and is rooted in his failed attempts to pressure the nations of the world — including our longest and most loyal allies — with crushing tariffs to sell goods in the U.S.
Of course this didn’t sit well with his fragile ego and he demeaned a reporter who asked him what he thought of Wall Street’s label, falsely claiming our nation was “stone cold dead” before he took office and warning her to never use the term or ask that “nastiest question” again.  
That did not keep TACO Don out of the headlines, however. 
Next up on the hit list was Elon Musk announcing his time with the Trump administration has “come to an end.”  While Tesla sales were cratering and his latest Starship rocket was blowing up, he added insult to injury by declaring that the “big beautiful bill” Trump has been arm-twisting Congress to pass would accomplish the opposite of what he tried to do with the phony “Department of Government Efficiency” to cut government spending.  
Although causing incredible hardship and damage abroad and at home — including here in Montana — by Musk taking a chainsaw to government agencies, DOGE didn’t come close to meeting the goal of slashing a trillion dollars from the deficit.  In fact, on his way out the White House door he warned:“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.” 
The worst, however, was yet to come when the Court of International Trade issued a permanent injunction against his tariffs, ruling: “The challenged Tariff Orders will be vacated and their operation permanently enjoined.”  The unanimous ruling, including a Trump-appointed judge, found the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Trump attempted to use to declare his emergencies, “does not authorize the President to impose unbounded tariffs” and halted them immediately. 
Even though a federal appeals court halted the trade court’s injunction for now, it is obvious that the law doesn’t allow the president to slap the nation and world around, the entire premise on which his emergency declarations were based is phony. There is no Canadian fentanyl emergency and there is no rare earth minerals emergency threatening the nation’s defense capacity. As noted in a recent article on the potential for recovering those minerals from Montana’s Berkeley Pits which contains 50 billion gallons of toxic water: “A single F-35 fighter jet uses 900 pounds of rare-earth metals.” If our national defense was so threatened, one might credibly ask why we then sell F-35s all over the world?
TACO Don’s “golden age” is unravelling faster than “the weave” of lies and threats in his incoherent speeches.  One might think it would be a good time for Congress, including Montana’s all-GOP delegation, to acknowledge the failed policies and propaganda, get up off their knees, and get back to working on realistic, humane, and long-term policies that benefit the nation and their constituents here in Big Sky Country — not prop up the would-be dictator in the Oval Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Sheehy-CNN.png,,,2025-05-30 06:59:02.474545

On Thursday a Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs accused O’Connell of “harboring” immigrants without legal status and “doxxing” immigration enforcement agents — echoing comments made by Tennessee 5th District Congressman Andy Ogles the day before.
“It certainly looks like Mayor O’Connell was involved in some sort of obstruction or the harboring of criminal illegal aliens in the great city of Nashville,” Tricia McLaughlin said in a media interview posted on the official X account of the Department of Homeland Security.
“But also just last night his office put out the names of Homeland Security investigators and doxxed our ICE enforcement officers,” she said. “They claimed it was a mistake. There’s zero chance it was a mistake and there will be repercussions.”

Late Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a list of cities, counties and states across the nation it said were “deliberately and shamefully obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws endangering American communities.” The list came with this demand that “these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens.”
Nashville and Shelby County in west Tennessee, the county seat of Memphis, appear on the list, which was entitled “Sanctuary Jurisdictions Violating Federal Immigration Law.” Neither Nashville nor Shelby County have adopted so-called sanctuary city policies, which are barred under Tennessee law.
The accusations against O’Connell center on a longstanding executive order requiring city departments to report interactions with immigration officials.
O’Connell revised the order in early May to require the reporting to take place within 24 hours.

The revision took place in the midst of a joint operation by the Tennessee Highway Patrol and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which led to the detainment of nearly 200 immigrants during traffic stops in South Nashville, a diverse neighborhood that is home to many of the city’s immigrant communities. The majority of those detained had no criminal records.
The mayor’s order requires all emergency and some non-emergency city agencies and officials to report any interaction with federal immigration to the Mayor’s Office of New and Indigenous Americans, a department created to foster civic participation.
The department posted a spreadsheet with summaries of the interactions on its website. As of Wednesday, there were 35 interactions reported between city officials and immigration authorities in May.
One entry identified an ICE analyst by first name. Two others listed the full names of Homeland Security Investigations officials. A fourth entry listed the full name of an immigration supervisor.
By Thursday morning, the names had been removed from the city’s website.
A statement from the mayor’s office said the names had been posted in error.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

“It is not the normal practice to include the names of individuals in EO30 (the executive order) reporting. Any names mistakenly included have been removed.”
Questions to the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday to clarify McLaughlin’s comments about “repercussions” for the mayor’s actions went unanswered.
The public comments about O’Connell by federal officials came a day after the announcement by White House “border czar” Tom Homan that — as a result of O’Connell’s public stance against the mass enforcement actions — multi-agency immigration crackdowns could soon return to Nashville.
“We’ll flood the zone in the neighborhoods to find the bad guy. We’ll flood the zone at work sites to find the bad guy, but we’re going to do it, and he’s (O’Connell) not going to stop us,” said Homan, the White House executive director of enforcement and removal operations.
Earlier this week, Ogles held a press conference to denounce O’Connell, a Democrat, for “aiding and abetting illegal immigration.” Ogles accused the Nashville mayor of obstructing the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, citing O’Connell’s public statements and executive order.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)In defiance of Gov. Jeff Landry, a Louisiana Senate committee rejected a proposal to give him more authority over appointees to 32 government boards and commissions, nearly half of which help regulate health care providers.  

The Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 4-3 against House Bill 603 Wednesday that would have allowed the governor to appoint members to state licensing boards without input from others. Currently, the governor has to pick these board members from lists of nominees provided by trade associations and industry leaders in the applicable field. 
Landry was seeking more authority over boards ranging from those that regulate certified public accountants, plumbers and engineers to ones overseeing nurses, dentists and physical therapists. The number of appointees Landry would have selected varied from group to group.

The legislation’s author, Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, said the current appointment system is problematic because it lets professional trade groups pick their own regulators. 
“The thought was to protect the consumer,” McMakin said at a public hearing this week. 
Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, backed McMakin’s bill and shared his concerns about the current structure of the boards. 
“The people who are supposed to be regulated are actually the ones doing the regulating,” Miller said. 

The bill closely resembles law changes Landry got approved last year that have already consolidated the governor’s power over state appointees. 
State lawmakers gave Landry the ability to appoint the chairs of 150 state boards and commissions directly instead of relying on the boards to pick their own leaders. These boards include the 32 Landry hoped to gain more control over through McMakin’s bill. 
Legislators also made changes in 2024 to the board of the Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority to give the governor more say-so on members of that panel.
The legislature also permitted the governor more power over appointees to the Louisiana Board of Ethics. Landry now gets to pick his appointees directly instead of having to choose from lists of nominees from Louisiana’s private college and university leaders. 

On Wednesday, Senate committee members indicated the governor’s previous power grabs made them wary of handing Landry more authority. 
“Don’t you think that the way the bill is .. strips away the voice of the particular industry to offer up potential nominees?” asked Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, who voted against McMakin’s legislation. “It makes it, in a sense, purely political.”
“This kind of gives even more power to an already powerful executive branch,” Sen. Gary Carter, D-New Orleans, said. “I have grave concerns about it.” 
McMakin said safeguards already in place make sure the governor selects qualified board members. The governor’s appointees have to meet certain standards to serve, such as holding an occupational license in the field they would have to regulate. 
The governor’s appointees also do not make up the majority of any of the licensing boards in his bill, McMakin said. 
Sen. Larry Selders, D-Baton Rouge, remained unconvinced that the governor should be given more authority. 
“Where is the protection? Last year, we gave the governor the authority to appoint the chairmen. Now, we are giving the governor the authority to put two or three people – or various numbers – on different committees. And so when is it going to change again next year?” Selders said, before voting against the legislation. 

Despite the legislation failing, McMakin said the governor’s office could find a way to revive it before the legislature ends its session June 12. 

“The bill is not dead,” he said in an interview. 

Legislators have shown less tolerance for growing the governor’s authority, however. 

A constitutional amendment aimed at giving the governor two at-large appointees to the five-member Public Service Commission failed to get off the ground earlier this spring. Landry’s push to give him more sway over appointees to a New Orleans-area flood protection agency board has also died this session.

(Johnathan Cohen/Getty Images)Like an aggressive hog in the show ring, U.S. trade policy is attacking every other participant for existing near its space. For anyone who has ever watched a hog show with an aggressive hog, there are no winners or losers in the fights, just a bunch of bruised and annoyed animals. Since January, U.S. trade policy has been fixated on tariff tax increases, compelling consumers and trade partners to leave the ring bruised and annoyed.
These tax increases are not a strategic tool but simply fuel volatility. In the short term, this policy is not beneficial to America, especially American farmers. Though we may say, “To the victor go the spoils,” the only thing agriculture wins from a trade war of this scale and strategy is spoilage, as perishable products wait for an end destination. Just look at Idaho’s experience with reciprocal tariffs during the first Trump administration. There were a couple of short-term brags, but the failures are still accumulating costs.
In 2018, the threat of tariffs leveraged small improvements in trade agreements with Mexico, Canada, Japan, and China and motivated partners to the negotiating table for a few Idaho products, like potatoes. But most commodities, including potatoes, paid the million-dollar price tag of retaliatory tariffs. The dairy industry faced significant price cuts, resulting in direct payments to dairies. Wheat also became less competitive on the global market due to retaliatory tariffs, losing market share to competitors, which takes years to regain.
Though the president claimed that China paid the tariff bill on products like steel, aluminum, washing machines, solar panels, and other goods, it was retailers and consumers who absorbed the tax on goods. But despite millions of Americans paying this tax increase, it wasn’t consumers who saw rebates. A few farmers with political leverage snagged 92% of the tariff revenue into relief payments, providing another revenue stream to fuel the unprecedented farm aid, but the relief wasn’t consistent or enough to make up for the trade war damage. This history is likely to be repeated with the president’s new, larger trade war.
But here’s the frustration: It wasn’t only farmers who were hurt during the trade wars. Main Street USA was damaged significantly as businesses using tariffed goods lost sales, and the entire agricultural supply chain saw economic impacts, including job losses and costs to the average household of at least $300.
A 2024 study concluded that despite claims to help the American heartland, the 2018-2019 tariffs failed to provide relief. Import tariffs had “neither a sizable nor significant effect on US employment in regions with newly-protected sectors [and] by contrast had clear negative employment impacts, particularly in agriculture.”
With Idaho’s cash crop receipts down 6 percent year-over-year in 2024 and the state’s growing export markets (14% increase YOY), market instability from the trade war will be damaging. Idaho haystacks from 2024 are still unsold, while export-focused hay presses turn off machines and lay off workers. Wheat piles sit waiting for movement to ports as the new crop approaches harvest, because planting decisions were made last fall. Most Idaho commodities, like dairy, meat, and potatoes are feeling the effects of instability.
Though the current economic instability will hurt Idahoans, Idaho farmers should have no expectation that any relief packages targeted at agriculture will overpower the economic losses from another trade war. Idaho received 1.4 percent of total government payments to agriculture in 2020, and what was received was pennies on the dollar for industries facing losses.
Farming’s annual production cycle leaves little room for market responsiveness, especially when tariff announcements change weekly.
“We’re in this window where people are deciding what crops they’re going to plant,” Economist Brett Wilder of the University of Idaho said. “People have to make that decision right now and live with that decision through the rest of the year, even if something changes next week.”
With the recently announced 90-day pause, Idaho agricultural producers can only wait and see, hoping the glut of products moves enough in the next three months to prevent spoilage of the new crop.
Admittedly, the aggressive hog has reason to be annoyed at some participants, but the current trade tactic is failing American businesses, farmers, and most importantly citizens.
Yes, improvements in the trade deficit, protection of environmental concerns and labor reform, and boosting manufacturing and critical industries are all concerns of many Americans that need addressing. But, as history has repeatedly shown, tariff tax increases will only cause products and work to spoil as America watches trading partners leave our show ring.

(AFGE webstream)Brendan Demich was on a bus to Washington, D.C. last week to attend a rally outside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ office.
At the same time, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was assuring lawmakers that critical programs in his department, specifically those protecting coal miners, would continue despite drastic cuts to his agency’s staff and budget.
It was the third in a series of contentious hearings for Kennedy. And for Demich, a Pennsylvania employee of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a research agency in Kennedy’s department, they were hard to stomach.
He’s part of a roughly 100-person team at NIOSH’s Bruceton facility in Allegheny County that studies the best ways to prevent injuries, illnesses and death in coal mines. Last month, he and all of his colleagues were notified that their jobs would be eliminated in June. Another team in Spokane, Washington, focused on safety in non-coal mines received similar notices.
Combined, they conduct the bulk of the agency’s mine safety research.
“[Kennedy]’s claiming that he hasn’t fired any scientists, and that the only people that they’re cutting are doing duplicative work, but that is absolutely not the case,” Demich told the Capital-Star. “Our titles may be engineers, but we do science … And there’s no other agency that does the work we do here at NIOSH.”
The picture Demich paints is different from Kennedy’s.
“The work at NIOSH will not be interrupted,” Kennedy responded to a question from a lawmaker about layoffs. “The work on mine safety will continue. We understand it’s critically important to function and we don’t want to see it end.”
The hearings took place over the last three weeks after reports emerged that critical and legally required programs to help miners with black lung disease were no longer functioning, after an estimated 90% of NIOSH’s roughly 1400 full-time staff were laid off, offered early retirement or placed on administrative leave pending termination in early April.
Miners developing black lung, an irreversible and degenerative disease, were suddenly not able to get approved for a program facilitating transfers to less dusty mines. Black lung screenings that can help miners with the disease receive federal benefits were also stopped.
This led to a class action lawsuit and pressure from Republican lawmakers to reverse the layoffs of federal workers whose jobs were ensuring mine safety.
So, earlier this month, Kennedy brought back over 300 NIOSH employees, including the Morgantown, West Virginia, team that studies black lungs and ensures benefits for programs for miners who develop it continue to function.
Kennedy also restored a team focused on the health of 9/11 first responders, as well as a team that works on the same Pittsburgh campus as Demich’s that tests and certifies respirators used by miners, firefighters and other professionals.
But Demich’s division is still expecting to be laid off.
Earlier this month, at a meeting, Demich said Pittsburgh employees in the mine safety division were told they no longer had to come into work, though a handful still do.
There had been hope with the Trump administration’s rhetoric around increasing coal mining and U.S. Health Department’s statements on the importance of miner safety that the job cuts would be reversed. But when NIOSH staff in other departments were brought back, Demich said, ”it crushed morale in the mining division. A lot of people see it as writing on the wall that we’re not being saved.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions from the Capital-Star about future plans for the mine research divisions. But a spokesperson provided a statement saying, “Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
Demich finds HHS statements on preserving critical programs frustrating, given the cuts on his and similar teams.
“I don’t know how you can say that you’re maintaining essential services for coal workers and miners when you’re cutting the divisions that mainly do the research and provide the services to prevent mine injuries, illnesses and fatalities,” he said. “Our work does not overlap at all with the [Morgantown] division, other than that we both want to prevent black lung.”

‘Those functions are going to disappear’ 
There is virtually no operational mine in the United States that hasn’t implemented safety measures based on research conducted by NIOSH.
The U.S. government got into mine safety research when the Bureau of Mines was established in 1910, after a series of deadly explosions killed hundreds of miners in just a few short years. The bureau was tasked with researching safer practices, inspecting mines and collecting data on the industry.
The work was successful. For decades, miner fatality rates steadily and precipitously decreased. That continued after the Bureau of Mines was shuttered and effectively rolled into the Department of Health and Human Services in the 1990s, where it now sits.
NIOSH’s mine safety divisions don’t set or enforce rules, but research it conducts has led to breakthroughs in technology that detects coal dust levels in real time, prevents mine roofs from collapsing, increases mineshaft ventilation and provides barriers between miners and powerful explosions.
“Those functions are going to disappear and I’m not quite sure who else would be able to do those,” said Tony Iannacchione, a former employee of NIOSH’s coal mine safety team who now teaches at the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering. “There’s some pretty unique expertise. And if you don’t have a government agency that’s keeping its thumb on the pulse and coming up with modifications and improvements to the systems being used in mines, we’re gonna be in a bad way.”
Iannacchione says that work is only getting more important. The more coal that’s extracted, the deeper miners have to dig to find it. That makes for more dangerous mines and requires new research and safety protocols.
“As you go deeper, you get higher concentrations of methane gas and all these problems just get worse,” he said. “For the industry to react to all these problems, it’s really beyond their capability. You need the government involved.”
Iannacchione cited recent NIOSH research that set new industry standards for blast walls that are placed between miners and explosives, as well as new methods for placing roof supports. The Pittsburgh team has also done extensive work on preventing hearing loss, which is an issue in underground mines that are full of loud machinery.
The coal mine safety team in Pittsburgh is also developing technology that can read silica dust levels in real time, but that has yet to be deployed. As miners dig into tougher terrain, they’re exposed to much more silica dust, which has led to an increase in the development of silicosis and black lung among younger miners and develops at an accelerated rate. Widespread use of real time monitors, Iannacchione said, could save lives. But it’s unclear if the work will be finished by the time the layoffs fully take effect in June.
Demich, the chief steward of the union representing Pittsburgh-area NIOSH workers, said he was working on a virtual reality training program for first responders and rescue teams to simulate mine disasters. They had begun training teams around the country, but the cuts effectively ended that work. He believes, with a little more time, they could have brought it to almost every mine rescue team in the U.S.
‘Benefit of the doubt’ 
Sam Petsonk has been an advocate for coal miners for his entire career. The West Virginia-based lawyer led the recent lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services that resulted in an injunction ruling last week, effectively requiring the return of NIOSH workers running Black Lung programs in Morgantown.
He successfully argued that the department was breaking the law by effectively shuttering congressionally-approved programs for miners with black lung by laying off the staff that implemented them. But, as he sees it, the law also requires the kind of research done by NIOSH’s teams that are still facing layoffs.
“These Pittsburgh programs are every bit as mandatory under the Mine Act,” Petsonk told the Capital-Star. “I would like to give Secretary Kennedy a bit of the benefit of the doubt here that he’s still digesting his obligations here.”
But the mandate is far less clear, with statute generally requiring NIOSH to conduct “research, demonstrations, and experiments” to support the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, which sets and enforces rules for mine companies to follow.
The injunction ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger focused on the availability of black lung programs, but also said “the Court orders that there be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and the attendant regulations for the health and safety of miners.”
Asked if he would bring a lawsuit if the mine safety research teams are not brought back, Petsonk said he wants to wait until the end of the 20-day period that Berger allowed to comply with the injunction. That will be on June 2.
“If they look at it, they will see the need to revive the mining research labs within NIOSH,” Petsonk said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about whether it believes the injunction applies to the research teams, or whether law requires them to be operational.
“They should just follow the law and re-open the research labs in Pittsburgh and Spokane because miners need it,” Petsonk said.
While it’s unclear if a legal remedy would be available to advocates like Petsonk who want mine safety research at NIOSH to continue, Demich is trying another way. When he was in Washington, D.C. last week, he and his NIOSH colleagues met with the staff of an estimated 15 to 20 lawmakers in an attempt to inform them about the research being lost and ask them to restore their jobs and research funding.
As it stands, even though Demich and his coworkers in Allegheny County are still technically employed, strict limits on research spending and travel would prevent them from doing a lot of their previous work.
Demich would not say which lawmakers’ staff he and his colleagues met with, since discussions are still ongoing. But he said the initial conversations were promising. He personally met with staff from lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. He did note they were two Democrats and two Republicans.
“There’s a lot of questions about coal mines and about all the work we’re doing here in Pittsburgh,” Demich said. “A lot of people want  to follow-up and I think we’ll be reaching out.”

Underinsured and not qualifying for Medicaid, she had to search for a local nonprofit to pay for her sight-saving surgeries. (Nada Hassanein | Stateline)COLUMBIA, S.C. — It’s as if she’s squinting through a smoke-filled room. But it’s Charisse Brown’s eye condition, glaucoma, that diminishes her vision.
Brown, 38, has worked all her adult life, with a personal policy of keeping two jobs at once. But when she started losing sight in her left eye last year, she was forced to quit her call center job. That left her with one income stream, her marketing research job, to pay her $1,300 monthly rent and other bills.
If glaucoma is caught early, monitored by a doctor and properly treated, it’s possible to stall the progression of the disease. Eye drops are necessary for keeping eye pressure down to slow glaucoma-induced damage. Without insurance, the monthly cost of the medication can run anywhere from $80 per bottle for a generic version to $200 or $300 for a brand-name one.
As an adult without children, Brown doesn’t qualify for Medicaid in South Carolina, which has not expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act. 
She’s enrolled in the lowest-premium plan on her state’s health care insurance marketplace, but ophthalmologists in the area won’t accept her insurance.
She said she called 211, a hotline for community services, but her voicemails weren’t returned. In medical debt and about to get kicked out of her apartment, she had to choose between her medication and paying for daily necessities like food and feminine care items. One food stamps enrollment worker told her: “We can’t approve you. If you go and have a baby, this will be a lot easier.”
“Single people — we’re struggling,” Brown said. “I feel like I’m getting punished for trying to do what’s right.”
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause a buildup of pressure that damages the optic nerve. Long called the “thief of sight,” it’s the leading cause of blindness in Black Americans like Brown. Black people are five times more likely to have glaucoma, and lose their sight at six times the rate of white people. Hispanic and Latino communities suffer similar disparities.
Among Black patients, a timely diagnosis is paramount: Glaucoma occurs on average a decade earlier — and advances faster.
But diagnosis and treatment can be costly and out of reach for many.
In South Carolina and the other nine states that have not expanded Medicaid, opponents of expansion say it would be too expensive to provide health coverage to more people, even though the federal government picks up 90% of the tab. But forgoing expansion also has costs. People without insurance or not enough insurance are more likely to visit the emergency room, as glaucoma and other chronic diseases take their toll. When it comes to eye diseases, vision can deteriorate without coverage for preventive care. And racial health disparities are higher in states that have not expanded.
“You see a lot of end-stage disease,” said Dr. Rebecca Epstein, a glaucoma specialist and ophthalmologist at South Carolina’s Clemson Eye, which was not involved in Brown’s care. “They don’t have insurance, and so they will delay care. And then they come in, one eye is already gone, another eye is on its way — and I’m sitting here having to tell them I’ve got to operate on their only eye.”
For about two months, Brown was fully blind in her left eye. Surgeries to address her warping cornea, a condition called keratoconus, and another to relieve pressure causing her glaucoma would cost upward of $10,000. Asked if they could offer a payment plan, her doctor’s office staff said no.
For days, Brown and her siblings called dozens of charities, asking for help to pay for her surgery. They called doctors across the state, asking if they had the necessary surgeon specialists and whether they accepted her insurance. Some nonprofits told Brown she was too young, that their help was reserved for older adults.
She finally landed on the South Carolina charity Lions Vision Services, affiliated with Lions Club International. The group offers eyeglasses, vision screenings and reimbursements to local doctors for surgeries patients living below the poverty line can’t afford. The charity told her it could pay for her eye surgeries, and Brown was in disbelief.










You don't give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you're going to pay for their disability when they go blind?


– Dr. Rebecca Epstein, ophthalmologist at Clemson Eye


“Access shouldn’t be this hard. Our state should do a better job of making sure that we have coverage for people and that they have access to care — before they’re blind,” Epstein said. “Here’s the crazy thing to think about: So, you don’t give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you’re going to pay for their disability when they go blind, right? How backwards is that?”
Had she not gotten the surgeries, Brown would have lost sight completely in that left eye, doctors told her.
Before she found Lions, the search had been so frustrating that she told her mother through tears, “Maybe I should just let this eye go.”
‘Shoulder that burden’
Since Brown could no longer drive, she’d take Uber rides across town for her frequent appointments. For appointments in Charleston with her surgeon, her mother would drive from Myrtle Beach to Columbia, 2 1/2 hours away, for another two-hour drive to Charleston. After one surgery, she developed an infection and had to visit her Columbia doctor daily — $30 roundtrip — because her case was so critical. Knowing she couldn’t afford the appointments, her doctor stopped charging her at follow-ups.
Servants for Sight, a faith-based nonprofit that helps South Carolinians in poverty pay for vision care, offers to pay for surgeries, treatments and Uber rides to eye care appointments. Rideshares have helped people “not only start their care, but complete their care,” said Amy Evette, executive director of Servants for Sight.
The group also runs a mobile vision screening unit that visits communities across northwestern South Carolina. Volunteers and staff screen for signs of diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy inside the white-and-green van, and connect patients to ophthalmologists for further care. The van is equipped with retinal imaging equipment and rows of free sunglasses. On the outside are logos of various eye care centers and nonprofits who volunteer to help.

“If people don’t have insurance or are not able to afford an eye exam once a year, it’s very difficult for them to detect any kind of eye disease,” said Sandra Torres, an ophthalmic technician of 17 years. The group works with homeless shelters, and she says many people end up on the streets because they lose their sight, and then their jobs.
The vehicle saw a busy recent Thursday morning in Spartanburg, a city of about 38,000 people roughly 30 miles southeast of Greenville. Stationed in the parking lot behind a free medical clinic, staff prepared for nearly three dozen patients scheduled that day.
Multiple residents filed into the van throughout the morning, many with thick contact casts wrapped around their calves and feet, used to heal and protect diabetic ulcers. Diabetes, which increases the risk of glaucoma, disproportionately affects people with lower incomes and communities of color, amid structural barriers to affordable health care and healthier food.

Angela Garrett, a local pastor, has been grappling with blurred vision and diabetes. Uninsured, she came to the unit to get her eye pressure and vision checked. Garrett, 55, is also recovering from a recent open-heart surgery. A caregiver for older adults, she said she’ll apply for Medicaid as soon as she’s recovered and can go back to work. In South Carolina, the income limit for a single person who is blind or living with a disability is $15,650.
She’s passionate about caregiving, a pursuit “from the heart,” even though her job is “the bottom of pay in medical,” she said. Despite her modest income, she may not qualify for Medicaid.
Often, patients don’t know help is available, or they stop coming to their appointments because they can’t drive and lack transportation, or they’re unable to pay, said Dr. Peter Daniel, another ophthalmologist and glaucoma specialist who works with the nonprofits. He recalled a glaucoma patient who stopped showing up for appointments. The man began to weep when Daniel told him not to worry about the cost and connected him with the charities.
“They’re in very difficult socioeconomic and complex situations,” Daniel said. “And those are the folks that I worry about going blind.”
Columbia optometrist Dr. Kendria Cartledge sees late-diagnosed glaucoma “daily.” She said the majority of her patients are on Medicaid, and that not enough eye care providers accept the public insurance program, putting more pressure on the ones who do.

The state Medicaid eligibility redetermination process has complicated matters. Patients may have had Medicaid in the past and are still struggling financially, but as states cull the rolls, they may lose coverage without knowing it. With glaucoma patients and others at risk of losing vision, timely care gets interrupted.
“A lot of these patients are getting lost to follow-up,” said Cartledge, who has been treating whole families with the disease among multiple siblings for years, building a relationship with them. “Some expansion would definitely help out these patients have better outcomes, have a better quality of life.”
The gigantic tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week could make that situation worse. The measure would cut federal Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years, largely by enacting new work rules and additional paperwork requirements. The changes would remove about 7.6 million people from the Medicaid rolls over the next decade, according to initial estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
Ophthalmologists like Daniel give care knowing they’re losing money, even after partial reimbursement from charities.
“If a charity can carry that burden, why can’t our state and federal systems help shoulder that burden? We do it for older patients, we do it for our Medicare population,” said Epstein, the Clemson Eye ophthalmologist. “Why can’t we do it for our younger patients?”
When ‘all else fails’
 Clad in a bright yellow tunic and woven sun hat, Jekeithlyn Ross stopped by the Servants for Sight check-in table to introduce herself. Only she didn’t have to. Marion Keller already knew Ross was the daughter of eye disease advocate J.C. Stroble as soon as she spoke her dad’s name. Keller has a bobblehead figurine of Stroble in her curio cabinet.

Ross has been on a mission to relaunch her nonprofit, the J.C. Stroble Glaucoma Awareness Foundation. Dormant during COVID-19, the organization is named for her late dad, who had glaucoma and was blind. The eye care advocate and Spartanburg icon died in 2013 at 71.
“Trying to get services to those that are falling between the cracks or the socioeconomically challenged is a challenge,” Ross said. “What we’re trying to do is go to the people, try to get the services to decrease the rate of blindness here.”
A volunteer with the South Carolina Lions Club and speaker at churches and national and local civic events, Stroble was also well-known in the community for his boisterous order-calling at the local fast-food fixture, the Beacon Drive-In. The eatery, where he was nicknamed the “Beacon Barker,” is popular among locals and as a stop on campaign trails. Inside, Stroble’s portrait adorns the wall chronicling the diner’s storied history, which includes presidential candidate visits, along with benchmarks like the launch of the internet.
At the Servants for Sight check-in table, the excitement was palpable: Ross and Keller talked about their mirrored missions as if they were old friends. Keller shared that she had a cornea transplant, and before they parted ways, she and Ross blew each other a kiss. “This is a marriage. This is only the beginning,” Ross said.
Ross said she was aware of glaucoma because of her dad, but others without exposure might not know the importance of getting their eyes checked, or even that it runs in their families.
“We’re back in action — because the need is great,” Ross said. “Education, awareness is the key. It’s essential, and it’s not enough foot soldiers out there putting that message out.”
She’s been going to churches, civic groups, clinics and mobile units to spread the word about the foundation.
“Nonprofits pick up the pieces. We have a little joke: ‘When the government and all else fails, then you come to us,’” she said with a wry chuckle. “Because what do you do? You help.”
‘Like looking through a plastic sandwich bag’
Servants for Sight helped pay for glaucoma surgery and eye drops for 71-year-old Jimmie “Coach Sheek” Robinson. The retired school bus driver and Little League coach said he’s had trouble accessing Medicare.

“It was like looking through a plastic sandwich bag,” he recalled. “I’m asking, ‘Lord, what is happening to my eyes?’”
Often running in families, glaucoma can sneak up in those with 20/20 vision all their life, like Robinson.
He couldn’t see his fellow churchgoers’ hands, extended to greet him with a handshake. He’d have to explain that his peripheral vision was waning.
Handshakes matter at Piney Grove Baptist, a small congregation with scarlet carpets in Anderson, about 30 miles southwest of Greenville. A “flimsy grip won’t do it,” said one deaconess at the podium on a recent Sunday. “You can tell someone loves you,” she said, by their handshake.
“Shake my hand,” she exclaimed as parishioners laughed. “Show up with love.”
That day, Robinson, donning glasses, was able to do that. Throughout the sermon, he’d wave his hand in prayer over his daughter and grandchildren, who filled the pew behind him.
“I’m not going to get depressed over my eye,” he said. “God been good to me.”
Back in Columbia, with those costly prescriptions, doctor and rideshare visit costs adding up, Charisse Brown said she is now steeped in about $7,500 in debt, with Uber costs totaling $1,500 alone. She’s kept a GoFundMe up to try to chip away at bills through donations.

She has just moved into another apartment, a gray-floored two-bedroom, where rent is $300 cheaper than her previous one-bedroom flat. Leaving lights on at night, along with the beaming lamppost right outside her back door, helps her navigate her apartment after dark.
“That’s pretty much the only way that I am able to see, is enough light is coming in, especially in my left eye,” she said.
Brown said her friends have noticed her own light dimming.
Friends have always called her “Kumbaya” for her outgoing and positive attitude. But after her vision crisis, she fell into despair. She stopped going out, self-conscious about the appearance of her left eye, which is sometimes swollen and has strabismus. Because she can’t hop in her car for a spontaneous road trip like she used to, she’s leaned on her personal avatar in the online game “Second Life,” where she simulates going to the beach and streams her pastor’s sermons, as if she’s sitting in the pews.
She’s trying to lift her spirits by writing poetry and tending to her plants. In the corner of her sparsely furnished living room sits a fern she’s named Duchess, a pothos called Prince and a few other small pots, studded with budding succulents.
Sitting on the couch, she reads from her poem “Overcome.” She’d been lying in the hospital bed after a surgery, using speech-to-text to write:
Darkness and light both dwell in the same universe, but light always outshines – so I nicknamed myself ‘Bright,’
To be able to blind the Dark from coming my way.
It’s so blinding that maybe he would give up
And leave me alone today.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Tennessee’s private prison operator is suing a consultant for $500 million for allegedly stealing a contract for non-detention services with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
CoreCivic, a Brentwood-based company that runs four Tennessee prisons, filed suit against Universal Strategic (US) Advisors this year, claiming it breached a deal to bring in business for CoreCivic by landing its own $73 million contract with ICE in March. The case was filed in Metro Nashville Circuit Court, but US Advisors is seeking removal.
Wanting to expand its web beyond federal and state prison operations, CoreCivic hired US Advisors for $30,000 a month to help it ink an agreement with ICE to handle administrative work dealing with undocumented immigrants who are under federal supervision. The job involves people who are released from detention on humanitarian grounds, bond or parole, those waiting for removal after immigration proceedings or people classified as fugitives from ICE or should be removed for other reasons, according to the filing. 
The idea was to enable ICE agents to work the front lines amid increased deportations under the Trump administration with CoreCivic taking over personnel and administrative work such as checking records, collecting documents, answering phone calls, entering data and doing criminal history checks.
CoreCivic signed a one-year contract with US Advisors and paid the company $1.56 million. But, according to the lawsuit, shortly after President Donald Trump was sworn in, the consulting firm notified CoreCivic in early February it was ending the contract in 30 days.
Both companies hoped to take advantage of inside contacts.
US Advisors’ chief executive officer, Tim Robbins of Utah, had held numerous leadership jobs in ICE and was an old acquaintance of Bart Verhulst, vice president of federal relations for CoreCivic. He was privy to the CoreCivic’s proprietary information and helped shape its plan to “penetrate” the Department of Homeland Security market. 
CoreCivic contends Robbins was supposed to avoid conflicts of interest, and he helped CoreCivic submit a proposal to ICE in 2023 for case management services. It was re-submitted in August 2024 and January, and CoreCivic was told that ICE was interested in its proposal. But “out of the blue,” on Feb. 9, CoreCivic received a letter from US Advisors terminating their agreement.
In early March, “much to its shock and dismay,” CoreCivic found out US Advisors and Robbins, while under contract, submitted their own proposal to ICE and then won the contract.

Tennessee is using a vendor on shaky ground in other states to send out the money for its private-school voucher programs.
The state has been contracting with Student First Technologies for two years, with an annual licensing fee of $695,000, for the Education Savings Accounts targeting low-income students in three counties and its Individualized Education Account program for special needs students, according to the Department of Education.
The department executed an amendment to the contract in early April to launch the so-called Education Freedom Scholarships for up to 20,000 students, depositing money into students’ online accounts to pay for tuition and other expenses at private schools, but not directly to parents. The legislature’s Fiscal Review Committee approved the expansion in March at a cost of $625,000 for the initial buildout and launch.
Despite Breakdowns in Two States, ESA Provider Student First Seeks to Expand

Privatizing education isn’t cheap. 
The newest iteration is costing north of $140 million annually, at least half of it going to students already enrolled in private schools, while the cost for ESAs could reach $25 million a year. Add the $1.3 million for disseminating money, and you’re creating a cottage industry.
The problem is that Student First Technologies promised West Virginia officials in September 2024 it wouldn’t go after more business until it repaired glitches that caused more than 3,000 unfilled orders and forced parents to spend their own money for books, technological equipment and other services, according to a States Newsroom report.
Besides those shortcomings, Student First lost a $15 million contract for an Arkansas voucher program when it couldn’t do the job correctly.
Tennessee and Student First have run into some of their own technical problems, but the company apparently has handled them. And instead of looking for another vendor, the state is doubling down with more work and a bigger contract.
The state’s relationship with Student First comes on the heels of a $2.5 million no-bid contract with Florida-based ClassWallet that used Career Ladder funds for teachers to pay the tab. Former Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn, who is going for a deputy secretary position in the U.S. Department of Education, caught the ire of lawmakers when she inked the deal without taking bids.
Which is worse, skipping the bidding process or sticking with a company facing lawsuits for shoddy work? It’s a toss-up.

The inquest continues
Nashville Democrats are trying to recall Metro Councilman David Benton after his appearance with xenophobic U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles in an anti-immigrant press conference at the State Capitol, on Memorial Day no less.
While Ogles accused Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell of opposing President Trump’s efforts to deport people without legal documentation, Democrats are peeved that Benton is backing the move to “Stop the invasion.” 
Recalling a Metro Council member could be difficult. The last time it happened took place way back in 2009 when Nashville attorney Jamie Hollin defeated Pam Murray, who was tied up in turmoil over allowing mobile vendors on Cleveland Street.
Aside from Democrats, the Metro Council’s Immigrant Council also condemned Benton, saying his “racist” propaganda is especially problematic because he represents a district with a large Latino population, which was targeted by ICE in a South Nashville roundup two weeks ago.

Never mind that many of the people Ogles and his ilk want to deport are washing the dishes, cooking the food and changing the bed sheets for white-bread America. 
Also put out of your mind that a handful of state lawmakers, mainly from Williamson County, used the State Capitol on a federal holiday to conduct a publicity stunt inside the Old Supreme Court chambers on the first floor, which is controlled by the governor. 
According to one report, the event was moved abruptly into the Capitol because of the threat of rain. But a press release sent out on Friday, May 23, said it would be held in the Old Supreme Court. 
Did it rain that day?

Last month, Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary and longtime anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral for the second unvaccinated child in Texas to have died in the ongoing measles outbreak. While in Texas, he met with the two grieving families — along with two local doctors promoting unproven measles treatments, whom he called “extraordinary healers.” 
Following the first death, Children’s Health Defense (CHD), the anti-vax organization Kennedy led until recently, pushed its own narrative claiming that the 6-year-old Mennonite girl did not actually die from the measles. In this effort, CHD has relied heavily on Pierre Kory, a Wisconsin doctor who has both amplified that assertion and claimed that the measles virus has been weaponized by unknown conspirators.
Kory is a Kennedy ally who has been widely criticized for spreading Covid misinformation during the pandemic, including pushing the use of ivermectin as a “miracle drug” for treating that virus. 
For years, CHD and Kennedy have promoted the debunked claim that the standard measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine given to almost all children in the U.S. is tied to autism. With an upsurge in the pandemic-era, right-wing embrace of the anti-vax movement — and of Kennedy himself — there has been a notable decrease in routine pediatric vaccinations in the U.S. 
Now that measles immunization rates have fallen below thresholds to maintain herd immunity in certain parts of the country, outbreaks such as the one in West Texas are expected to become more common. In February, Texas reported the country’s first measles death in a child in the more than two decades since the disease was classified as eradicated in the U.S. 
In response to this death, CHD posted a video on March 19 featuring Kory and Ben Edwards, another Texas doctor Kennedy applauded, discussing the girl’s medical records, which her parents released to the organization. 
Despite having no training in pediatric medicine and having had his board certifications in internal medicine and critical care revoked last year, Kory claimed the child’s death was due to incorrect antibiotic management of a bacterial pneumonia infection that had “little to do with measles.” Edwards — a family doctor who has been treating measles-stricken children in Texas with medications not indicated for measles and was accused of seeing pediatric patients while actively infected with measles himself — concurred with Kory. 
Without being able to examine the medical records themselves, pediatricians consulted for this article were limited in their critique of Kory’s assessment. But they did question his understanding of empiric antibiotic recommendations for pediatric pneumonia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia infections following viral diseases are common, and pneumonia is a well-documented complication of a measles infection. 
These doctors also questioned the strong personal bias underpinning Kory’s assessment and pointed to his history of extreme claims about Covid made online and to right-wing media outlets  as evidence against his reliability as an “expert.” 
Furthermore, Kory has been inconsistent in his messaging around this measles death when addressing various audiences. When Alex Morozov, founder of the counter-misinformation group Eviva Partners, confronted Kory about his statements regarding the young girl’s cause of death at the so-called “Summit for Truth & Wellness” on March 29, the answer he got was very different. At that event, Kory suggested this was a case of the measles being “weaponized.”
In an audio recording of their conversation published by Morozov, Kory said: 
Do you want to know the real story on this case? Quite a few of us believe that they weaponized the measles virus. And this measles is more. They’re doing this on purpose. She got sicker from the measles probably because they monkeyed with the measles virus…. Do you know how many bioweapons labs there are and what they can do?
Like the unfounded claim of an error in medical treatment, this “weaponized measles” narrative has spread rapidly throughout the online crankosphere. However, this conspiratorial rhetoric has not been accompanied by urgent recommendations for increased vaccinations to prevent infection from a supposedly more virulent strain.
Kennedy, who promoted pandemic conspiracy theories along with ivermectin as an alternative to Covid vaccines, has called Kory “honest, brave, and sincere” and “a brave dissident doctor.” The doctor appeared with him at various campaign-related events in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, both before and after RFK Jr. suspended his own campaign and joined forces with Trump to launch the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement. 
As ivermectin proved to be ineffective against Covid, Kory turned on the life-saving mRNA vaccines while cozying up to Kennedy and CHD. Kory and the ivermectin group he co-founded — the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), now called the Independent Medical Alliance following a pro-MAHA rebrand — have rallied with Kennedy and CHD on multiple occasions, including against Covid vaccine mandates during the deadly Omicron wave in late 2021 and early 2022.
Kory has not just turned on Covid vaccines, but routine childhood immunizations in line with Kennedy’s and CHD’s established anti-vax rhetoric as well. 
In 2023, Kory appeared in an FLCCC webinar about pediatric vaccines titled “Your Child, Your Choice.” The same year, despite his lack of pediatric credentials, he served as an “expert” on the issue of childhood vaccinations for Republicans in Wisconsin.
That same year, Kory testified at the Wisconsin Capitol as part of a GOP-led effort to block adding the meningitis vaccine as a state requirement for school-aged children, which is  required in many other states and has been recommended by the Center for Disease Control’s Advisory Council on Immunization Practices since 2005. (While Kory and company were initially successful, the meningitis vaccine was eventually added to Wisconsin’s requirements as of the 2023/24 school year.) 
During this measles outbreak, both Kennedy and Kory have once again promoted “alternative” treatments. 
Kennedy has drawn heavy criticism for pushing vitamin A as a treatment for measles while simultaneously failing to provide a sorely needed, full-throated endorsement of the MMR vaccines. Following the second death, while the HHS secretary correctly called the vaccines the “most effective way” to prevent measles, he quickly undermined his own statement. In his tweet about the funeral, Kennedy included a shoutout to doctors Edwards and Richard Bartlett, his other “extraordinary healer” from Texas, for their use of unproven treatments on infected children in the local community. 
On March 31, Kory appeared in another CHD video about the first Texas child’s death, claiming she should have received intravenous vitamin C, which is not indicated for measles-related pneumonia. Of note, prior to his co-authorship of questionable papers on the use of ivermectin to fight Covid, Kory co-authored a since-retracted paper on a Covid hospital protocol that featured vitamin C.
Given his past statements on Covid and routine pediatric vaccines as well as his ties to Kennedy and CHD, Kory would have a vested interest in distancing himself from children’s deaths from vaccine-preventable illness. But this is dangerous, experts warn, during a measles outbreak where vaccines play a vital role in stopping the spread of disease.
A representative for the hospital that treated the first child spoke out against “misleading and inaccurate claims” about this case being circulated online. “Our physicians and care teams follow evidence-based protocols and make clinical decisions based on a patient’s evolving condition, diagnostic findings, and the best available medical knowledge,” the spokesperson said.
CHD did not back down in the wake of the second pediatric measles death early last month. The organization requested hospital records for this case while offering a free e-book — featuring a foreword by Kennedy — on “secrets the government and media aren’t telling you about measles and the measles vaccine.” The book accuses the mainstream media of weaponizing outbreaks “for political gain.” 
In an email to their followers on April 7 — the day after the second child’s funeral — CHD announced an April 17 webinar event called “Inside the Measles Deception” featuring Kory, Booker, and Edwards. The restricted event was available only to their donors. 
On April 8, CHD tweeted, “Our mission hasn’t changed. The MMR vaccine is dangerous and has caused more deaths than measles,” a claim that is totally unsubstantiated. The next day, Kory returned for another CHD video claiming to have reviewed the medical records for the second case and, unsurprisingly, again maintained that the 8-year-old girl did not die from the measles. He said:
“This is just getting exhausting, this constant fear-mongering by the media. I’ve already lost so much trust in the institutions of society. But to see them rampage like this on inaccuracies and peddling falsehoods and just distortions, it’s terrible. It’s terrible for our health. They are scaring people into getting what I think is a very dangerous vaccine.”

(Katie Myers | BPR)This coverage is made possible through a partnership between BPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline transports natural gas through West Virginia and Virginia. But for 10 years, climate activists and worried locals opposed it, even locking themselves to equipment and camping in the pipeline’s path. Many were opposed specifically to the transportation of natural gas, which includes methane, a highly flammable fossil fuel with a large carbon footprint. A new graphic novel, Holler, released in May, tells the story.
Denali Sai Nalamalapu, a Southwest Virginia-based climate activist and illustrator, spoke with BPR on what this fight meant for people who were involved and what it means now. 
This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Tell us a little about yourself and why you were drawn to the Mountain Valley Pipeline to begin with?
I joined the pipeline fight to support, with communications and federal and congressional advocacy. As I started traveling more to the region, I got more connected to the community here that was fighting the pipeline and also to the mountains. I wanted to figure out different ways to tell the stories I was hearing, particularly stories of ordinary people who were just living their lives and then became pipeline resistors. And so I sat down with six people across the region that’s impacted by the pipeline in Central Appalachia, and the book came to life from there.
What did this pipeline mean, not only to the people in West Virginia that the pipeline directly impacted, but also to the broader Appalachian community? How did it unfold regionally?
When the pipeline was first proposed, it was part of and continues to be part of a centuries-long history of massive extractive fossil fuel projects coming to the region. 
Part of what made it unique though, is that it is such a huge project, being three 303 miles long, going through all of West Virginia, through Southwest Virginia, into Southern Virginia, with extensions that threaten communities in Northern North Carolina. And it’s methane gas, which is a highly flammable gas that’s also contributing to climate change.
It was such an intense, huge fight that came right after and during the fights against coal mining and specifically mountaintop removal in Central Appalachia. It did show up in this lineage of strong resistance in Appalachia that is very well known in this region, but continues to go overlooked outside of the region.

“Holler” is a graphic novel, which is a unique way to tell a character-driven story. Why did you choose the graphic novel format, and to explore the MVP through these six activists?
All of that thinking was part of, how do I tell a story of the Mountain Valley Pipeline Fight with the voices of the resistors uplifted? 
One of them is pretty well known. Her name’s Becky Crabtree, and she is known as the Grandma who locked herself to her Ford Pinto when her sheep farm was threatened by the pipeline.
And the other is a quieter resistor named Paula Mann, who is a photographer who used her skills to document the way the pipeline threatened the woods that seven generations of her family have lived in.
Part of who ended up being part of the book … were people who both had been part of the struggle and had been covered by the news, and who were the quieter resistors, and who were the younger resistors who were in college when they learned about the pipeline, and who were the people that were well into their 80s learning about it, and also diversity because I think central Appalachia gets thought of as this very white, very poor region that has no diversity. Oftentimes, the Monacan tribe and the other indigenous tribes in the Southeast don’t get recognized as tribes and people who are continuing to fight and protect this land.
The MVP ultimately was greenlit in 2024, and is continuing to make its way down through to North Carolina. Protesters may have the opportunity to carry these lessons forward. In 2020, the government approved an extension of the MVP into North Carolina called Southgate.
 Where does the pipeline fight go from here and what’s happening now?
It felt important to me that we did lose the fight, in a traditional way of deeming did you win or lose the pipeline fight, while also telling engaging and authentic stories of the community that was built through the pipeline fight and the people that were changed by the pipeline fight. 
And as we see the federal government in the U.S. and many powerful entities across the world not take climate change as seriously as we believe that they need to, we’re going to have to define winning with more nuance than, did you absolutely stop the project or not?

The state Senate unanimously approved House Bill 90 by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, without discussion Thursday. The proposal would ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and ResX from arranging reservations through their platforms if they do not have explicit contracts with restaurants. 
Hebert’s bill is expected to become law with Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature, having received unanimous approval in every committee hearing and floor vote in both chambers, 
Reservation trading platforms allow diners with hard-to-get table reservations to sell them online in auction-style transactions similar to eBay. Prospective buyers can also use the platforms as a concierge service, offering a flat fee to anyone who can secure them a table at a particular establishment.

While the practice of paying for restaurant reservations is more common in places such as New York and Miami, the trading platforms have come under scrutiny in Louisiana since the Illuminator reported on high-dollar trades in New Orleans during Super Bowl weekend. 
The transactions included a $2,138 reservation for a table of four at Antoine’s.
In a previous interview, Hebert said some local eateries reported confusion over complaints from diners who bought reservations without realizing the restaurants weren’t the ones selling them. 
“We’re not talking about Chick-fil-A here,” Hebert said. “It’s a select group of restaurants they’re doing this to … They’re profiting off of a restaurant’s brand, and the restaurants don’t even know about it.”
Backed by the National Restaurant Association, versions of the legislation began popping up in state capitols last year. 
Reached after Hebert’s bill advanced Thursday, Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said his small business is facing seemingly insurmountable odds. Only a few years old, his startup logged more than $6 million in trades over the past 12 months.  
“I’m weighing my options, but it certainly feels like a David versus Goliath situation,” Frey said.
At the center of the debate is a market space currently dominated by the booking platforms OpenTable and Resy, which operate under a very different revenue model than the nascent trading platforms. 
OpenTable makes money by charging restaurants a fee every time someone reserves a table through its app, while the trading apps charge diners a percentage of the winning bid price for each trade. 
If the newer trading platforms can secure partnerships with restaurants, they would pose a serious threat to the well-established booking apps. Restaurants would no longer have to pay the third-party booking platforms whenever diners make reservations and would actually make money every time someone books through a trading platform. 
Frey said he offers contracts to restaurants giving them an equal share of the winning bids for every reservation. It would give dining businesses a new revenue stream from something that currently costs them money, he said. 
However, Louisiana lawmakers don’t believe it’s a viable industry and see reservation trading as an opportunistic industry that is artificially inflating demand just to cash in on wealthy tourists. 
Hebert and his colleagues have argued that tables would be easy and free to reserve if software bots weren’t snapping them up from OpenTable and then listing them for sale on the trading apps. 
Frey disagreed with that assessment and said he doesn’t think technology could even do that.  
Large booking sites have several security layers, such as requiring personal phone numbers with text message verification, in order to make a reservation.    
The trading apps had no lobbyists or advocates speaking on their behalf against Hebert’s bill, so lawmakers have only heard one side of the argument. 
Hebert said his intent is not to end the practice of reservation trading but to simply give the restaurants back their right to control their own bookings. 
If the trading apps continue to operate in current form after the new law takes effect, they could face fines of up to $1,000 per trade.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Across the nation, law enforcement agencies are accessing Flock Automatic License Plate Reader (ALPR) camera databases, regardless of whether they have their own contract for the AI-powered system. Researchers from 404 Media published a data trove derived from Flock audits earlier this week. Although the audit data came from the Danville Police Department in Illinois, Wisconsin Examiner found that intelligence units within the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) also appear in the database.  
The audit data shows that last year on July 15 and Oct. 21, personnel from the Southeastern Threat Analysis Center (STAC) — a homeland security-focused arm of the MPD’s fusion center — conducted a total of three searches within Danville PD’s Flock network. STAC gathers and disseminates intelligence across eight counties in southeastern Wisconsin. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
MPD’s own Fusion Division is co-located with the STAC. Together the units operate a “real time event center,” a vast network of both city-owned and privately owned cameras and operate Milwaukee’s gunshot detection system known as Shotspotter. They also monitor social media and conduct various types of mobile phone-related investigations. STAC has also explored the use of drones, facial recognition technology and predictive intelligence.
MPD’s Flock searches were logged under the user name “D. Whi” from “Milwaukee WI PD – STAC”. In the dataset’s “reason” column, the searches were recorded as “HSI investigation” and “HSI vehicle loader.” Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) specialize in matters of immigration, illegal exporting, cyber crime and national security.
By tapping into Danville’s Flock data, according to the audit, STAC was able to access 4,893 Flock networks and an equal number of individual devices, such as cameras, for the July 15 search alone. The other two searches from October reached 5,425 Flock networks and devices and captured data from a one-month period. 
404 Media’s investigation focused on how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has accessed Flock databases nationwide, despite not having a contract with the company themselves, and how various agencies appeared to conduct immigration-related searches. Whereas many searches were logged as “immigration violation,” “ICE” or even “ICE ASSIST,” others only noted the involvement of HSI. 
In a statement sent Wednesday morning, an MPD spokesperson denied that STAC’s use of Danville PD’s Flock network was immigration-related. “Information regarding this investigation is classified and not available as it is ongoing,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to Wisconsin Examiner. “I can confirm it is related to a criminal investigation with HSI and not immigration related.” The spokesperson later added that this was a “HIDTA investigation,” referring to a federal task force linked to the federal High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program. 
MPD’s HIDTA units are attached to the department’s Special Investigations Division, a separate branch from the Fusion division and STAC. “The majority of HIDTA and STAC investigations are classified,” the spokesperson wrote in the statement. “Oftentimes, these investigations involved confidential informants and sometimes it could take years to resolve.”
Several police departments in Milwaukee County utilize Flock cameras. MPD entered into its contract in 2022. Over 1,300 registered cameras operate across the city as part of Community Connect, a program supported by the Milwaukee Police Foundation, according to the program’s web page, with nearly 900 “integrated” cameras which grant MPD real-time access.

Both the use of automatic license plate readers and MPD’s ability to participate in immigration enforcement are governed by specific policies. The department’s immigration policy, SOP-130, cautions that “proactive immigration enforcement by local police can be detrimental to our mission and policing philosophy when doing so deters some individuals from participating in their civic obligation to assist the police.” The policy limits MPD’s ability to assist ICE with detaining or gathering information about a person to “only when a judicial warrant is presented” and when the target is suspected of involvement in terrorism, espionage, a transnational criminal street gang, violent felony, sexual offense against a minor or was a previously deported felon. 
A curiously timed public hearing 
Privacy advocates have raised concerns and filed lawsuits over Flock’s ability to collect and store data without a warrant. The license plate reader policy – SOP 735 – allows personnel to access data stored “for the purposes of conducting crime trend analyses” but only when those activities are approved by a supervisor and are intended to “assist the agency in the performance of its duties.” 
MPD personnel may use Flock to “look for potentially suspicious activity or other anomalies that might be consistent with criminal or terrorist activity” and are not prohibited from “accessing and comparing personal identifying information of one or more individuals who are associated with a scanned vehicle as part of the process of analyzing stored non-alert data.” Automatic license plate reading technology captures information from any passing car. In some cases, investigators may also place specific vehicles on a Be On the Lookout (BOLO) list, also known as a “hot list”, which notifies law enforcement whenever a specific vehicle is seen by a license plate reader-equipped camera. 
A Thursday morning public hearing held by the city’s Finance and Personnel Committee considered whether more Flock cameras should be added to Milwaukee’s already existing network. Ald. Scott Spiker spoke in support of the cameras, and said he worked to install license plate readers in his own district. Spiker described having discussions with local business district leaders and MPD’s fusion center, which resulted in cameras being deployed on 27th Street. “Don’t ask me where, because I won’t tell you,” said Spiker, adding that the cameras “serve a variety of purposes” from combating car theft to aiding Amber and Silver Alerts.

“There’s going to a broader question, which I imagine will be a subject of the public testimony, however, and I’m fine hearing it, but ultimately there’s going to be a discussion to be had in the city of anything that smacks of surveillance software, and what sort of oversight is provided, and should be provided,” said Spiker. He added that such a discussion “will be had in full in Public Safety” and that although he welcomed public testimony, the committee was there to discuss approving a contract, and not concerns over surveillance. 
“The camera’s already in use by MPD, and in use by our parking checkers,” said Spiker. “When they do night parking enforcement, they use ALPR’s. When they do zoning enforcement during the day, they use ALPR’s. So these are already in use. They have no facial recognition or any of the stuff that’s been in the news. But it is a legitimate question to ask what degree of surveillance of any sort, given the national context, do we want to have oversight over?” 
Spiker said that there’s a “big debate” about surveillance but that “we can’t sort that out today.” 
Amanda Merkwae, advocacy director with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, complained that the public had not been alerted ahead of time about the discussion of the Flock contract. “I’ve been checking daily and the documents in this file and the text of the resolution weren’t posted until yesterday [Wednesday] afternoon,” said Merkwae. “So I think for an item that has significant implications for the civil liberties of Milwaukeeans, particularly the most vulnerable resident, that’s concerning.”

The agenda had been out for over a week, and was amended a couple of days before the hearing, Ald. Marina Dimitrijevic later explained. 
Merkwae said, “We know that ICE has gained access to troves of data from sanctuary cities to aid in its raids and immigration enforcement actions, including data from the vast network of license plate readers across the country.” She cited a 404 Media investigation earlier this month, which found that Flock is building a massive people look-up tool which pulls in different forms of data, including license plate reader data, “in order to track specific individuals without a warrant.” 
Merkwae also referenced 404 Media’s findings this week revealing immigration-related look-ups, as well as the classified investigation that involved MPD’s intelligence units. The advocacy director also questioned what MPD’s policies mean in practice when federal or out-of-state law enforcement want to access its Flock databases. 
“If law enforcement told us that they wanted to put a tracking device on every single car in the country so that we know where every car is every single moment of the day, and we’re going to build a database of all those locations run by an unaccountable private company, and accessible to every law enforcement agency across the country without needing any type of a warrant, I think we would be alarmed and we would have some follow-up questions,” said Merkwae. “So at the end of the day, we think the public deserves to know how it is being surveilled and the common council deserves to know the answers to some pretty basic questions before approving contracts for surveillance technology that’s deployed without a warrant.”
In 2023, Fox 6 published a map of Flock cameras operated by MPD. The map, broken up by aldermadic district, shows a large cluster of cameras located on the North Side around District 7, as well as a cluster on the South Side around District 8. Smaller clusters of cameras were located on the East, far Southwest Side and Northwest Side of the city.

After Merkwae testified, Spiker raised a question about whether public testimony should continue, given open meetings laws. A lengthy discussion followed about which issues and topics may be discussed in the hearing by committee members, which halted public testimony for over 20 minutes as alders heard from city attorneys and MPD. Ald. Miele Coggs said hearing the public’s concerns before a contract is approved for surveillance technology was important. Ald. Dimitrijevic also stressed that public comment was an important step, saying that the committee would not go into closed session to discuss the Flock contract before the public finished speaking, or otherwise limit public testimony. 
When public testimony continued, Milwaukee residents shared further concerns about the technology. Ron Jansen said that the city has seen a surge of surveillance gear used by MPD. “Between the growth of a fascist regime in Washington …  and our own militarized and violent police force here in Milwaukee, it’s clear that the last thing we need is more ways for police to track us,” Jansen said. He added that Flock networks are capable of tracking and cataloging “people’s every movement throughout a given day” even if they’re not the target of an investigation.
  Ald. Scott Spiker (City of Milwaukee)
Other residents, including locals from Spiker’s district and representatives from the court diversion non-profit program JusticePoint, also spoke against Flock’s expansion. Tara Cavazos, executive director of the South 27th Street Business District, said Flock cameras had made her area safer. “We are the initiators of these three additions to the Flock network,” said Cavazos. “And we donated the funds for two years of use of these Flock cameras. So they’re not coming from MPD’s budget, it’s coming out of our budgets. These Flocks are not going to be placed in a neighborhood, it’s not specific to any vulnerable communities, they are in business districts on state and county highways.” 
Cavazos said that since Flocks have been deployed, car thefts declined “significantly on the south end of our corridor, where the border between Milwaukee and Greenfield is,” and that “we’ve caught a homicide suspect.” Leif Otteson, an executive director of two business districts, said that he hears from people who want more surveillance. Otteson recalled working to expand the city’s ring camera network, which STAC and other parts of MPD’s fusion center have access to. Otteson has talked with people who want cameras in their community gardens and other areas. “I just want to make that clear, that people like myself are getting those requests,” said Otteson. 
Once public testimony concluded, the committee went into closed session for over an hour. The discussion pertained to an unspecified “non-standard” provision in the Flock contract, which had been raised by the city attorney’s office. When the committee returned to open session, they voted 4-1 to hold the file due to legal concerns with the contract until the next committee meeting on June 18.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Few Trump administration agencies are so out of control as Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
ICE in recent months has disappeared people from American communities, a hallmark of unaccountable authoritarianism. The agency releases scant information to the public about its activities, and it withholds information even in court proceedings. Its agents wield the awesome power to deprive people of their liberty, and they’ve used that power to deposit hundreds of people in a brutal foreign prison, likely for life.
Demand for oversight has rarely been so great, and no tool of ICE oversight should be left unused.
Members of Congress have at least one method by which to oversee the agency — they can show up at ICE detention centers unannounced and perform inspections. But U.S. representatives and senators in Colorado exercise this authority too infrequently.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
ICE this year has undertaken aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as part of President Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportations. In Colorado, which Trump made a particular focus of his anti-immigration program, the agency has undertaken several raids and other operations that have resulted in scores of people being held at its detention center in Aurora, operated by private prison company the GEO Group.
People there are often denied constitutionally guaranteed due process, targeted for their exercise of First Amendment rights, and held without being charged with a crime, according to court documents and immigration advocates. About 12 detainees were removed from the Aurora facility to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador.
Federal authorities have gone about this business with essentially no transparency. That’s where oversight comes in.
In 2019, U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, tried to inspect the ICE facility after learning about poor health conditions there. He was denied entry, prompting him to pursue on-site oversight authority, which he helped secure in law. Members of Congress, according to language that is included annually in appropriations legislation, now have the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities.
This was no empty gesture. Crow has routinely invoked the authority ever since, and he posts to his website reports about visits to the detention center in Aurora. His office has already completed two oversight visits this month.
This is the same authority by which three U.S. representatives from New Jersey recently tried to conduct oversight at an ICE facility in that state. They were denied entry, and the Trump administration charged one of the lawmakers with a crime.
But ICE’s refusal to respect oversight authority is no cause to idle it. It’s reason to assert it to its fullest extent.
Crow should not be alone in conducting inspections in Aurora. Democratic U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado should also show up. Hickenlooper has expressed anger over the Trump administration’s lawless approach to immigration enforcement, even suggesting in April that “the country’s going to rise up” in response. But to a reporter’s question about what senators like him could do, he said, “You want me to get my pitchfork?”
No. But lawmakers can get inside a facility where Colorado residents, snatched off the streets by the federal government, now face unconstitutional removal to prisons run by foreign dictators, and at least demonstrate to ICE and the people of Colorado that they’ve got their eye on MAGA malfeasance in Denver’s backyard.
Other members of the U.S. House from Colorado can also exercise oversight of ICE. The detention center in Aurora sits in Crow’s district, and territorial deference is doubtless a factor, especially among fellow Democrats. But Crow could arrange a multimember visit. The detention center in New Jersey sits in McIver’s district, and two other members of Congress from neighboring districts had arrived to inspect the facility with McIver when they were denied entry. Strength in numbers sends a message that the members will do everything they can to hold an outpost of authoritarianism in Colorado to account.
A member of Hickenlooper’s staff accompanied a Crow staff member during one inspection in March. In response to questions from Newsline about whether they’d visited the Aurora facility, the six Democratic members of the Colorado congressional delegation — Bennet, Hickenlooper, Crow and Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen — responded in a joint statement: “Oversight is a key part of our jobs, and a responsibility we don’t take lightly. The Trump Administration’s recent attempts to intimidate Members of Congress from conducting oversight of ICE detention facilities are alarming — and we will not back down. We are fully committed to providing the necessary oversight and transparency of the GEO ICE facility in Aurora to ensure these facilities are run in full accordance with the law, and our offices will continue to perform the critical casework to ensure detainees are treated fairly.”
The oversight authority alone won’t enable members of Congress to stop the abuses that ICE commits in Aurora. Crow helped establish the authority at a time when immigration advocates were most concerned about health conditions, not cancellation of basic rights. No facility walk-through can remedy the profound injustices at work there.
But at a time when Democrats seem overwhelmed and impotent as the Trump administration dismantles constitutional order, every available counterweight should be applied with maximum force.

Participants in the Make MI Home program will receive free access to Michigan’s state parks, opportunities to connect with others through curated events and discounts at various local attractions and businesses.
Two years after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced the creation of Chief Growth Officer Hilary Doe’s position in her Mackinac Policy Conference keynote, Doe said the state is beginning to trend in the right direction, with Detroit and Flint both showing population growth for the first time in several years.
“Every year, there are more people moving to Michigan and fewer moving out than there were in the year before,” Doe said.
But she said there is still work to do to ensure those trends continue, which is why the state announced more than $700,000 of grant funding for five programs aimed at reversing Michigan’s population decline.
Make MI Home offers grants to programs throughout the state to help people with things like housing and relocation support, access to coworking spaces and more.
Among the grant recipients is the City of Detroit, which will receive $210,000 to launch the Detroit Tech Fellowship Program, which will target recent graduates from Michigan universities to scale their startups in Michigan, providing access to coworking space, housing support, and cohort events to network and collaborate with peers and local entrepreneurs.
“What we’re talking about today is making it easier for people to say yes to living in Michigan,” Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist said.
Gilchrist said he understands the need for the funding as someone who was born and raised in Michigan but left the state to pursue his career after graduating college.
“We grow our population one decision at a time, one person deciding where they’re going to take their next step in life, where they’re going to build their next chapter, where they’re going to make their family and their future and their career real,” Gilchrist said.

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s colleges and universities could lose millions of dollars and thousands of jobs after the federal government froze international student visa interviews on Tuesday, mounted efforts to require all foreign students to undergo social media vetting and announced plans to “aggressively revoke” Chinese students’ visas. 
The actions, spearheaded by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the behest of President Donald Trump’s administration, are likely to disrupt international students considering attending any of the schools in the commonwealth. Over 21,000 international students were enrolled at Virginia colleges and universities in the 2023-2024 academic year, according to the National Association of Foreign Advisors’ Association of International Educators. 
International students contributed $807.2 million to Virginia’s higher learning institutions in the same period, NAFSA reported in its latest data.
Tim Gibson, president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said the student visa interview pause and other changes could negatively impact international students, who have proven to make positive contributions to U.S. universities and the commonwealth, and deter international students from pursuing an education in America, including Virginia.
“They just want to learn and they come here because they want to learn from us,” Gibson said, “and they want to learn at American universities because American universities have a stellar reputation around the world for academic freedom, for having resources to support excellent undergraduate and graduate instruction, and for having the kind of freedom of an openness to explore the questions you want to explore and to make the contributions you want to make.”
George Mason University, located in Fairfax County in Northern Virginia, was the highest recipient of funding from international students, receiving $207.5 million, ahead of Virginia Tech, the University of Virginia, VCU, and Northern Virginia Community College, which rounded out the top five institutions in the commonwealth with the most financial benefit from foreign students during the 2023-24 school year.
Student visas are essential for international students to legally enter, reside, and study in the United States, including at institutions in Virginia, which, if foreign students stop attending, could face financial challenges since students from outside the U.S. pay higher tuition fees compared to in-state students.
Since Tuesday, the administration has directed U.S. embassies and consulates, who are responsible for issuing visas, to suspend new visa interviews for international students seeking to study in the U.S. until further guidance is provided.
The move comes after the administration accused some institutions, including Harvard University, of allowing antisemitism on campus. The administration is attempting to revoke Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which enables the university to enroll international students. A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to do so, after Harvard filed a lawsuit to retain the right to admit international students.
On Wednesday, Rubio announced the State Department along with the Department of Homeland Security will be revoking visas for Chinese students, including those with “connections” to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields.” The agencies will be revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong, Rubio’s statement read.
Gibson said the announcement is concerning for many students, especially graduate students, because they often bring their families who attend daycares and schools in the commonwealth.
“Now they’re threatened with deportation for no reason other than paranoia, racism, and xenophobia,” Gibson said. “Even just making a threat has irreparably harmed the international reputation of our universities and colleges.”
In a statement on Tuesday, NAFSA said the latest action by the Trump administration is another “misguided” and “deeply troubling attack” against international students, who are facing arrests, visa revocations and threats to their ability to enroll in certain U.S. institutions.
The association said it’s also a waste of taxpayer funding to screen students who are already subject to extensive background checks, compared to business visitors and tourists.
“If the administration believes enhanced scrutiny is necessary, it should be applied uniformly — not selectively to students who have long contributed to American classrooms, communities, and cutting-edge research,” a NAFSA representative said. “Moreover, there is no urgent justification to halt visa appointments while internal policy updates are considered. This only adds unnecessary delays, fuels uncertainty, and damages our reputation as a welcoming destination for global talent.”
This week’s actions aren’t the first issues concerning international students the Trump administration has weighed in on. 
In January, the administration directed U.S. diplomats and consulates to refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to its fraud prevention unit for mandatory social media checks, through two executive orders focused on protecting the country from foreign threats and combating antisemitism.

The temperature of water in the Chesapeake Bay naturally fluctuates each year, tied to weather patterns and ecosystem changes across the bay’s massive, 64,000-square-mile watershed.
But a new study led by the University of Maryland is yet another confirmation of what scientists have reported for years: The bay is steadily warming and seeing a growing number of extreme heat incidents known as marine heat waves.
The frequency of underwater heat waves in the bay doubled over the past 20 years, researchers say in the paper published this week in a scientific journal called Estuaries and Coasts.
Marine heat waves refer to stretches of days or weeks with unusually hot water temperatures. On average, the bay annually experiences about 25 days of extreme heat, according to the new study.
Jacob Wenegrat, an assistant oceanography professor and part of the research team, said the increase is likely due to the bay’s slow warming over time.
That’s driven by changing climate conditions worldwide that show no signs of slowing down. The ocean absorbs 90% of the excess heat from global warming.
“If you project out to the end of the century, what we would call a heat wave now might just be sort of standard conditions,” Wenegrat said.
The group analyzed temperature data from 2003 to 2022 from a variety of satellites and validated it with long-term data collected by buoys that have sensors throughout the bay.
The Chesapeake is particularly ripe for research because it has a uniquely extensive dataset from decades of monitoring by federal and state agencies, Wenegrat said.
The researchers noticed significant differences between the upper and lower sections of the bay.
The area north of the Potomac River saw more frequent heat waves, but for shorter durations. In the lower part including Virginia, there were fewer heat waves but they lasted longer.
Wenegrat said it’s not yet clear what leads to the variability.
Officials are concerned about hotter water because it can kill off seagrass, which is a sort of “nursery” for other marine life, causing ripple effects including fewer rockfish and blue crabs for local fisheries.
Higher temperatures are also known to lessen the amount of oxygen in the water, which can suffocate animals and help spur the growth of harmful algae.
Satellite data only captures temperature at the top of the water, “a very surface snapshot,” Wenegrat said.
Research by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science last year aimed to get more information from farther down the water column, where it’s harder for heat to penetrate. Their study found that summer heat waves stay closer to the surface, while winter temperature increases go “all the way down to the bottom.”
Wenegrat said he’s excited by the potential to combine both types of data for a fuller picture of what’s happening in the bay. He hopes the growing sources of information help local officials take action to prepare.
“Once you have the conditions for a marine heat wave in place, there’s not a lot we can do directly to stop it,” Wenegrat said. “But there is a lot that can be done from a management perspective.”
That includes helping protect marine species, setting up an early warning system and addressing potential economic impacts to industries that rely on the water.

(Photo by Cappi Thompson/Getty Images)Every fall, winter ticks in New England sit on shrubs or other plants waiting for a large animal to pass by so they can latch on and begin sucking out blood. This has a huge impact on the area’s moose, wildlife biologists say.
“They basically become zombies and die,” Eric Orff, a New Hampshire-based wildlife biologist, said. “We have zombie moose.”
According to estimates from New Hampshire Fish and Game, the Granite State’s moose population peaked in the late 1990s at around 7,000 to 8,000 moose. It has since declined to roughly 3,000 to 4,000.
Most tick species move from host to host frequently, but winter ticks find a moose, deer, or other animal around November and extract their blood for the entirety of winter. And it’s not just one or a couple ticks on each host. Rather, hundreds or thousands of ticks often latch onto a host. This is a process called questing and it has a huge effect on moose, particularly calves.
“April is the month of death for calves,” Orff, who works as a field biologist at the National Wildlife Federation and serves as vice president of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation, said. “The adult ticks are feeding one more time before they fall off and they basically drain the moose’s supply of blood.”
Around April, the female ticks fall off their hosts to lay their eggs. If they land on snow as opposed to dry land, the eggs are less fruitful. However, as climate change represses winter weather, tick populations have boomed.
“Over the last 20 years, instead of one winter out of six or eight or 10 being truncated, now, a majority of them are,” Orff said. “So what has been found in more recent moose studies, including those done in New Hampshire and in Maine and Vermont the last two decades, is that it really significantly impacts the moose calves born that previous spring.”
While adult moose are better able to fend off the tick infestations, he said, 70% of calves don’t make it to 1 year old. And this also affects adult female moose. Orff, who has been studying moose and other wildlife for decades, said that when he and his colleagues began this research in the 1980s, nearly all older female moose gave birth to two calves. Now, he said, less than half the females even become pregnant. He said this is a result of being underweight from the ticks, but also because climate change is making summers warmer, which results in them eating less. Underweight moose are less likely to give birth.
“It’s really a double whammy,” he said.
A third factor, he said, is that south of the White Mountains brain worms have proliferated. While moose populations have plummeted, white-tail deer populations have nearly tripled from about 40,000 in the early 1980s to around 100,000 to 120,000 in the southern half of the state due to milder winters, he said. Brain worms are common in deer, and while those brain worms don’t harm the deer, they can be fatal to moose.
Orff noted the economic costs of lower moose populations. He said people used to travel to the North Country specifically to see the moose.
“Moose viewing in New Hampshire for a period of years was a $10-million-a-year industry,” he said. “I don’t know if there’s any companies that still do it. I think there are. But you used to be able to go out and, in a night, see a dozen or a half dozen moose at least. Now they may go several hours and see no moose.”
These die-offs also cause ecological issues. Henry Jones, moose project leader for Fish and Game, said moose carcasses serve as a food source for scavengers, which are seeing rising numbers in the wake of this population collapse. Jones said the past two years have been particularly severe for tick infestations.
To address this, the state is issuing more hunting permits. Jones said tick populations rise when the moose population has high density. By killing off moose, the survivors fare better, he said. The state is also working with the University of New Hampshire to study the conditions in which ticks proliferate best. Jones said this is all about “keeping them from getting really high density and causing this kind of cyclic relationship of lots of tick mortality.”
However, the hunting strategy still results in dead moose and low populations. Orff noted the conundrum.
“I guess that’s the debate,” Orff said. “Is it better to have far fewer moose and less sickly moose? … Baby moose who drop dead from no blood in April or taking some of them out that will be utilized by hunters eating them?”
Jones said the state is acting based on the wishes of citizens.
“We did a public survey to understand what the residents want with the moose population in 2024,” Jones said. “People want there to be the same or more moose, but they don’t want there to be more moose if they’re unhealthy.”
Still, Orff said none of these are a true solution to the overall problem. Moose will continue dying, he said, until we put an end to humans’ warming of the planet.

Here’s what the Senate has proposed.
A business tax credit to fund the arts
The House budget had eliminated the Arts Division of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, including the New Hampshire Council on the Arts. That division had received about $1.7 million in state funding, and $2 million in federal funding. 
The Senate’s proposed amendment, passed Thursday, would restore the division, but change how it is funded. Rather than receiving general fund dollars, businesses could donate to the Granite Patron of the Arts Fund, and receive 50% of that donation as a credit against the business profits tax. The tax credit could give out a maximum of $350,000 a year, which would translate to a maximum potential budget of $1.4 million over two years for the arts fund.
The amendment is a shift in approach for Sen. Tim Lang, a Sanbornton Republican, who earlier proposed reducing funding for the Arts Division to $1.
“My inbox was filled when I allocated $1 for the Council on the Arts, and I took that to heart and I made changes,” he said. “This will allow for a tax break system — it will still allow them to collect donations, but make it more incentivized by allowing those corporate donations or private donations.” 
Democratic Sen. David Watters, of Dover, called the compromise “very helpful.”
“I think that making sure … that we have the core operations covered, so that there can be somebody who actually goes out and tries to sell these tax credits, that is good, and I think that will keep the office functioning,” he said.
A position cut for the Housing Appeals Board
The Senate restored funding to the Housing Appeals Board, which is designed to give developers and residents an alternative to the state court system to resolve conflicts with local zoning and planning boards. The House had cut that panel entirely, which costs $560,864 over two years. 
But Senate Finance Chairman James Gray said the committee would recommend eliminating a position within that board, and would attach the board to the state’s Board of Tax and Land Appeals, which handles disputes over state and local taxes as well as property assessments. 
Gray said the attachment was designed to save on personnel costs to run both boards. 
Aging commission restored; Commission for Human Rights to receive more scrutiny
The Senate Finance Committee recommended reviving the Commission for Human Rights, a panel designed to investigate discrimination complaints and pass them on to the Attorney General’s Office for potential prosecution under state anti-discrimination statutes. The House had abolished the commission, but the Senate restored it, at a cost of $2.7 million over two years. 
But another Senate amendment would require the Department of Justice’s civil rights unit to oversee the commission. The amendment would also mandate that the chairperson of the commission be a licensed attorney in the state. 
The committee also proposed restoring funding to the State Commission on Aging, at $150,000 per year. Currently, that is funded at $280,432 per year; the House had voted to eliminate the commission. The commission, established in 2019, is charged with making recommendations on how the state can support older residents and increase the health care workforce for direct care. 
Senators revise expected revenues higher
The votes this week came as the Finance Committee decided to follow a rosier outlook for revenues the next two years. On Wednesday, Lang, who is also the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Department of Revenue Administration Commissioner Lindsey Stepp had recommended new projections for the state’s business profits tax, meals and rooms tax, and real estate transfer tax. 
The new projections would increase business tax revenues by $75 million over the biennium; the meals and rooms tax by $27.8 million; and the real estate transfer tax by $5 million. 
Lang cited analyses from Morningstar and Kiplinger, two research firms, that suggested New Hampshire could benefit from uncertain economic conditions by attracting people seeking to save money or take local vacations. 
Sen. Dan Innis, a Bradford Republican, backed up Lang’s analysis, arguing he believes revenues will come in even stronger than Lang’s proposed increase. 
But a Democratic senator, Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua, said she disagrees with the move to increase projected business tax collections. Rosenwald said she had her own conversation with Stepp, and had received a more mixed assessment of businesses.
“If the tariff stuff doesn’t calm down, that’s going to lead to more business uncertainty, but if the extension of the federal tax cuts gets made (in Congress), businesses will like that, because they like certainty,” Rosenwald said. “…So I’m not comfortable with increasing the business tax rates.”
Adopting those new projections will allow the Senate to plan for nearly $108 million more in revenue over the next two years, which could help it ease some cuts imposed by the House. The committee voted to approve the new revenue figures on party lines, 5-2. 
Affordable housing money increase blocked
The committee voted on Wednesday against a proposal to increase the amount of money transferred to the state’s affordable housing fund from $5 million to $7 million. That money comes out of the state’s real estate transfer tax. 
Watters argued that the fund should be increased to allow more development because the current amount is not enough. Initially, Democrats and affordable housing advocates had pushed for the annual transfers to the fund to be doubled, to $10 million.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5293785-Senate-Finance-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-30 06:01:00.128710

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Times are tough for Arkansas farmers, who like many of their counterparts across the country, are dealing with challenges such as high input costs and low commodity prices for crops. Weather and pests also pose issues, but Jacob Rowell of Kings River Produce said the bigger problem is finding a market for produce once you grow it. 
“I can’t explain as a farmer how much time I had to spend marketing,” Rowell said. “Finding a market for your product is 75% of the battle, the other 25 percent’s growing it. You can figure out how to grow it, but it don’t do you no good to have 10,000 pounds of produce if you ain’t got nowhere to go with it.”  
It was “a game-changer” for the 29-year-old farmer when he began working with Spring Creek Food Hub. The nonprofit connects local farmers to wholesale institutions, specifically nonprofits like schools, hospitals and community health care clinics, Director of Operations Nena Hammer said.
Spring Creek provides technical assistance and equipment to Rowell, who said he’s been growing root crops, like carrots, on his farm near Eureka Springs and selling them to the food hub, which has distributed the produce to local schools. 
“It’s awesome. It really is awesome. I could see this thing growing the food community here in this part of the state tremendously,” he said. “I would like to see it grow where it’s reaching all corners of the state.”
Spring Creek works with about 65 farms across Arkansas, but could potentially reach more at its new home inside the new Market Center of the Ozarks, which celebrated its grand opening in downtown Springdale Thursday. 
The 45,000-square-foot food hub is designed to support local farmers and food entrepreneurs by providing resources like crop aggregation, certified commercial kitchens, cold storage and technical assistance to help strengthen Northwest Arkansas’ local food system, according to a press release. 
The $31 million facility is part of the Northwest Arkansas Food Systems initiative launched by the Walton Family Foundation in 2020. Plans for the Market Center of the Ozarks were announced in 2022.

Emily English, the foundation’s senior program officer for NWA Food Systems and director for Market Center of the Ozarks, told guests at the grand opening that the center will help shape the future of local food in Northwest Arkansas. 
“The investment in Market Center of the Ozarks was never about creating a standalone project,” English said. “It was about building the missing infrastructure that enables our community partners to do what they do best.”
In addition to Spring Creek, the new facility will also house the Arkansas Food Innovation Center at the Market Center of the Ozarks. An initiative of the University of Arkansas’ Division of Agriculture, the AFIC at MCO supports local entrepreneurs by offering a shared-use commercial kitchen, food processing and bottling capabilities and technical support.
Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman said the facility will help Arkansas consumers more readily access food that’s grown and raised by local producers. 
“As chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I’ve met with farmers and ranchers and producers from across the state who are eager to sell their products in their communities and explore new ways to sell directly to consumers,” Boozman said. “It makes all the sense in the world to connect the food that is grown and raised here to families and entrepreneurs in the region so they can have access to fresh food while supporting their hardworking neighbors.”

Boozman said he’s confident the new facility will serve as a model for other regions of the country looking for ways to support local farmers and food entrepreneurs. 
“You can’t just keep doing the same thing,” he said. “You have to figure new and innovative ways to go about solving a problem, and so hopefully this will be a great example, not only for the state of Arkansas but for the rest of the country as we move forward.”
Solutions for supporting farmers are of particular importance in Arkansas where agriculture generates a $24 billion economic impact annually and is the state’s largest industry. Hunger is also a problem for the Natural State, which at a rate of 19%, has the highest prevalence of food insecurity in the nation, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released last year.
“Market Center of the Ozarks is just one piece of a much larger puzzle,” English said. “It represents what’s possible when we invest not just in buildings but in people — in the farmers growing our food, the entrepreneurs launching new ideas and the organizations working every day to feed our families. Together we’re building a more connected, resilient local food system.”

More legislatures in Republican-led states are passing paid parental leave for public employees. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)More Republican-led states are giving paid parental leave to public school teachers and other state employees, signaling a broader acceptance of family-friendly workplace policies once championed primarily by Democrats.
“All of these red states, I think we’re late to the party,” said South Carolina state Rep. Beth Bernstein, a Democrat who sponsored a bill this year to increase state employees’ paid parental leave from six to 12 weeks. It passed the majority-Republican South Carolina House in April with strong bipartisan support.
This year, Alabama, Iowa and Mississippi joined 37 other states in granting paid parental leave to thousands of state workers.
The trend has gathered steam in recent years. Some experts link it to the cascade of state abortion bans that followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which dismantled the federal right to abortion. Under fire from critics to do more to care for babies once they’re born, at least a dozen conservative-led states with abortion bans have since granted or expanded paid parental leave for their state employees.
But others say the increasing bipartisan support for measures that help working parents is also a reaction to economic realities.
“What we’ve seen, especially in more conservative states, is the public sector has experienced a lot of turnover,” said Kameron Dawson, legal director of the Southern Office of A Better Balance, a legal organization focused on workplace rights. “They’re looking for tools to recruit younger employees.”
Paid parental leave is the time off granted to workers for the birth or adoption of a baby, to care for a child, or to recover from a stillbirth or miscarriage. Without it, employees are left to cobble together their sick leave and vacation leave — or go unpaid — to stay home with a child and heal.










We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.


– Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver


Alabama Republican state Rep. Ginny Shaver watched her daughter, a public school teacher, struggle to get the leave she needed after the births of her children in recent years.
“With her second, she had complications in her pregnancy and used up her [paid vacation and sick] leave before she even had the baby,” Shaver told Stateline. Her daughter contracted COVID-19, and the baby had to spend time in neonatal intensive care. “It was a very difficult time, and she had to take unpaid leave.”
Last year, Shaver and Democratic state Sen. Vivian Figures worked to win approval of a paid parental leave bill for state employees. It failed.
But they tried again this year. With the support of Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, the state legislature — which has a Republican supermajority — passed it nearly unanimously. The new law gives female state employees, including teachers, eight weeks of paid parental leave in connection with birth, stillbirth or miscarriage, and gives male employees two weeks. Adoptive parents get eight weeks for one parent and two for the other.
Shaver said she thinks the law passed thanks to vocal support from the governor and increased awareness of the issue due to the work she and Figures did in previous sessions.
“And the fact that all of the southeast states around us offered it,” Shaver said. “We’re trying to attract and retain state employees and teachers, and we’re in competition with everyone around us, and the private sector as well.”
Keeping talent
For many Republicans, the workforce development argument for paid leave is a persuasive one. For states such as Alabama and South Carolina that have some of the lowest workforce participation rates in the nation, paid leave can be a tool to keep more people — particularly women — working. And it can be a way to retain educators as many states struggle with teacher shortages in K-12 schools.
“For several years we’ve seen state legislatures acknowledging the importance of child care to businesses and the economy,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director at the Southern Office of A Better Balance. “But in the last few years, we’ve seen a growing recognition that paid leave is another piece of that puzzle.”
New rules protect pregnant workers, but red states sue over abortion provisions

States have taken up the issue because the federal government has not. The United States is a global outlier; among 38 peer nations, it’s the only one that doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. The group comprises 38 democracies with market-based economies.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993 and extended in 2020, only requires public agencies and companies with at least 50 employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for parents of newborns or newly adopted children, or caregivers of sick family members.
GOP support
During his first term, President Donald Trump publicly supported some forms of paid family leave and signed a defense bill that gives 12 weeks of paid parental leave to most federal employees.
Paid family leave was a signature issue for his daughter Ivanka Trump, at the time a senior adviser to the president. She even held a paid leave and child care summit at the White House in late 2019.
That set the stage for other Republicans to take up the issue more publicly. And after the Dobbs decision, family-friendly policies have increasingly become conservative talking points in states with restrictive abortion laws.
After the Mississippi House unanimously passed a paid parental leave bill earlier this year, Republican House Speaker Jason White celebrated the bill as a reflection of Mississippi’s status as a “pro-life state.”
In a post on X this week announcing her signing of a new paid parental leave law, Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds called Iowa “a pro-family state.”
North Carolina was one of the first Southern states to grant paid parental leave to state workers in 2019 when then-Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, signed an executive order. In 2023, several months after the Dobbs decision, the state’s majority-Republican legislature extended paid parental leave to public school employees by tacking it onto a law banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy.
Meanwhile, Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun signed an executive order in March to add up to eight additional weeks of paid leave for “childbirth recovery” to the state’s existing four weeks of paid parental leave.
Running the gamut
The new laws won’t apply to most residents, because they only cover state employees. But they could have a downstream effect.
Shaver, the Alabama lawmaker, said she hopes her state’s new law will not only help the state be competitive with the private sector, but also set a precedent for other employers to follow.
“I hope they will see it’s in their benefit to offer what they can,” she said. “It may not be eight or 12 weeks, but even offering a reduced or flexible work schedule can help families.”
Just over a quarter of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave through their employer as of March 2023, according the most recent data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
Among the lowest-wage earners, that share drops to 6%.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

State paid leave programs run the gamut in terms of what they offer. While Alabama’s new law offers up to eight weeks of leave for all state employees, including teachers, Mississippi’s offers six and does not require public schools to offer paid parental leave to their employees.
Iowa’s new law grants four weeks of paid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and one week of paid paternity leave. Tennessee’s law, passed in 2023, only offers paid leave to workers in the state’s executive and judicial branches.
But a few states are already expanding their offerings: Last year, Georgia legislators voted to double paid parental leave from three to six weeks.
And some states have gone further than just state employees: 13 states and the District of Columbia have mandated paid family leave for all workers, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Most of those states are located in New England or on the West Coast and all are Democratic-led. Ten more offer voluntary paid family leave statewide that’s provided through private insurance.
Sandwich generation
Experts say the shift in attitude toward family-friendly policies can also be attributed to a generational shift.
“A lot of younger lawmakers are more willing to champion the issue of paid leave,” said Freeland, of A Better Balance. “They’re understanding it because they’re seeing it in their own lives, or seeing friends and family members going through this.”
In South Carolina, Bernstein’s bill faced some opposition from members of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and Family Caucus. Some lawmakers questioned the potential costs of the bill, or criticized it as government overreach.
South Carolina Republican state Rep. Josiah Magnuson, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he believed the bill would be a financial burden on public school districts that could lead to raised taxes.
“You’re saying, let’s tax the people of South Carolina, most of whom don’t get paid parental leave, and give them to state employees who already have six weeks’ paid parental leave,” Magnuson told lawmakers in April before the House voted to pass the bill.
He also said he doesn’t like that the increased paid leave “puts the foot in the door a little more for the government to be involved in the home.”
The opposition frustrated Bernstein, who pointed out that the state’s 2022 law that granted six weeks of paid parental leave passed the legislature almost unanimously. This year’s bill expanding that leave passed the House but hasn’t seen movement in the Senate. It can be picked up again when the legislature returns in January.
Other South Carolina Republicans backed the bill, citing their own families’ experiences following the birth of their children, reported the South Carolina Daily Gazette.
More conservative states are also responding to the needs of “sandwich generation” employees who may be caring for aging parents as well as children, Freeland said.
Earlier this year, Tennessee became the first Southern state to expand its state paid leave policy beyond just parental leave. The state legislature voted almost unanimously to extend its six-week paid leave policy to cover state workers providing end-of-life care to a family member.
“We’re seeing a growing recognition that people need support for these types of family or caregiving needs,” said Freeland, “and that it strengthens the workforce and economy to be able to provide that.”

No one ever said our state prisons would or should be cushy places to live and work. But neither should they be decrepit dumps in which an underpaid and understaffed workforce struggles to cope with an inmate population that is at once aging and unhealthy, and increasingly hopeless and prone to violence.
Unfortunately, as a recent legislative hearing made clear, that’s pretty much where things stand today.
As Department of Adult Correction secretary Leslie Dismukes told lawmakers, thanks largely to low pay and lousy working conditions, at least 13 prisons have an employee vacancy rate of over 50%.
Meanwhile, the system now has a running tab of 1.4 billion dollars in deferred maintenance. Indeed, fire suppression systems are outdated or completely inoperable in 23 prisons and several lack air conditioning – a fact that guarantees more illness and violence.
The bottom line: As with so many other problems plaguing state government, the solution to this crisis is no mystery—lawmakers simply must appropriate better funding. And their ongoing failure to do so is inexcusable.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


	
After President Trump took office, his administration quickly issued guidance giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement the greenlight to make arrests in or near courthouses.
In the months since, there have been several highly publicized arrests at courthouses around the country. In one instance FBI agents even arrested a Wisconsin judge, alleging she obstructed an immigration arrest. Judge Hannah Dugan has filed a motion in federal court to have her charges dismissed.
Franklin County’s rules prohibit any civil arrest without a judicial warrant in the courthouse itself or on the sidewalk and entryways. ICE agents typically use an administrative warrant signed by an agency official rather than a judge.
The rules also prohibit the execution of a judicial warrant in a courtroom unless the judge agrees to allow it in writing, and restricts court staff from requesting or sharing information about a person’s immigration status.
In a press release, the court emphasized its responsibility to ensure due process for the public at large.
“That mission is jeopardized when victims, witnesses, and defendants are afraid to come to the courthouse to testify and participate in ongoing cases, fearing civil arrest and deportation from courthouse grounds,” the release stated.
People deciding not to show up, the court argued, undermines the fairness of trials “for citizens and non-citizens alike.”

Senate bill 172
State Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson, believes the court overstepped its authority. Her proposal “specifies that persons who are unlawfully present in the United States are not privileged from arrest.”
State law already bars civil, but not criminal, arrest in several circumstances. You can’t get arrested going to the polls on Election Day, on the Fourth of July, on Sundays generally, or at a place of worship on the traditional day of worship.
Huge majorities support due process for migrants. They haven’t always gotten it in Ohio

The same privileges apply to court. The parties to a case, witnesses, jurors, and court officials, can’t be arrested for civil violations at, or on the way to and from court — a point cited in the local rules. But Roegner’s proposal would remove those privileges for undocumented individuals, and she said it was “drafted in response” to Franklin County’s changes.
“Senate Bill 172 would provide much needed support for federal immigration authorities,” she argued, “by requiring state and local public offices and public officials to allow the arrest or detention of any person who is suspected of being in the United States illegally for that person’s removal or for other immigration related purposes.”
The proposal also prohibits any public office in Ohio from enforcing rules that bar cooperation with immigration authorities.
How wide a net?
State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, quipped that it’s “amazing thing that we would even have to do this.”  But the scope of Roegner’s proposal gave others pause, particularly in the context of the Trump administration’s recent track record with immigration enforcement.
Up until the first Trump administration, immigration authorities generally avoided places like courts, schools, hospitals and churches. But in 2018, an ICE directive laid out a policy that increased courthouse arrests substantially.
Trump campaigned for his second term promising mass deportations, and his administration has tried to fast-track those removals at the expense of due process. Last week a federal judge in Boston ruled a deportation flight to South Sudan violated his previous court order.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the administration could not deport a group of more than 170 Venezuelans with just 24 hours’ notice. In its ruling, the court pointed to a different, highly publicized case in which Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accidentally deported to El Salvador.
Trump administration contends U.S. courts can’t rule on Kilmar Abrego Garcia

“Had the detainees been removed from the United States to the custody of a foreign sovereign,” the majority wrote, “the government may have argued, as it has previously argued, that no U.S. court had jurisdiction to order relief.”
State Sen. Casey Weinstein, D-Hudson, said he understood Roegner’s concern about illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. But he expressed doubts about giving free rein to officers seeking someone only suspected of being in the U.S. unlawfully.
“With some of the stories that have come out about immigrants who have been wrongfully detained or even wrongfully renditioned out of the country, I was just curious what your thoughts are on protections for legal residents — legal immigrants — who may feel concerned that they could be wrongfully targeted in this?” he asked.
Roegner said the U.S. is a country of immigrants and pointed to her own mother immigrating to the country from Finland. But she insisted “we’re also a country of laws,” and if someone is here legally “they would really have nothing to fear.”
“So yeah, will mistakes happen? Probably, yes, they happen all the time,” Roegner said. “But they can be cleared. They can say, ‘yep, no, I’m a legal immigrant, and here’s my paperwork,’ and they can prove that they’re here rightfully.”

Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) and state Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton), Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) outlines a joint resolution for Pride Month, (Screenshot/WisEye)Wisconsin Democratic lawmakers are circulating four draft bills and two joint resolutions to address issues of discrimination against members of the lesbian, gay, trans and queer community.
The package was announced just before  Pride Month begins on June 1.
“We celebrate the history of the LGBTQ+ movement and the future of our population, and I can’t think of a more important time to do that,” said Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire), at a Capitol press conference Thursday. “Meanwhile in Washington the Trump administration and Republicans here in Wisconsin are engaging in rhetoric and political activity that seeks to erase LGBTQ+ people and target us …  the goal in that rhetoric and in that movement is to make us feel alone.”
Embracing diversity and joining with  allies give the community strength, Phelps said.
“Everybody who is not themselves a member of the LGBTQ+ community knows and loves at least one person in the community. And I think when they shut out all the noise and look inside, they know that they want the best for that person or those people,” Phelps said.
In addition to a joint resolution embracing Pride Month, the Equality Agenda legislation includes measures to:

Update various Wisconsin laws pertaining to married couples, including laws on adoption and on in vitro fertilization, to ensure they apply to same-sex couples.
Prohibit “conversion therapy” aimed at changing a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity and subjecting licensed professionals who practice it to professional discipline.
Bar the use of a “gay or trans panic” as a defense by persons accused of crimes.
Provide grants for training school counselors and social workers on LGBTQ+ rights.

Also part of the package is a proposed amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution that would repeal the 2006 amendment declaring marriage to be only between one man and one woman.
The amendment preventing the state from legally recognizing same-sex marriages remains on the books although it was overridden by the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage across the country.

File photo from MaxPixels.net.Federal officials are raising questions about exploding drug discounts under a program meant to fund services for low-income patients, and Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic is at the center of some of them. 
Over a 38-month period ending in June 2023, the massive nonprofit hospital received nearly $1 billion from the program. However, the clinic didn’t cut drug prices for any of its low-income patients, instead plowing the money into its general budget.
Officials at the clinic told congressional investigators that they used the money in other ways to help poor patients. Yet in 2023, the nonprofit hospital had enough money to pay 22 of its executives more than $1 million and another 30 over $500,000 — and still finish the year with nearly $1 billion in “net income.” A private business would call that “profit.”
For its part, the clinic pointed out that its operating income was much smaller than that, and that it spent almost as much on free or discounted care in 2023.
Dramatic expansion
Cleveland Clinic was one of two hospitals to come under scrutiny as part of a U.S. Senate investigation of a drug-discounting program known as 340B. 
It requires drugmakers who want to sell their products to Medicaid patients to also sell them to qualifying hospitals and clinics at deep, legally defined discounts. The hospitals and clinics then sell them at much higher prices and pocket the difference — notionally, to provide care to people who can’t afford it.
When it was created in 1992, 340B was intended to free up money and make federal resources go further for providers who cared for a heavy mix of low-income and underinsured patients. But after the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 and the 340B rules were changed, the amount of discounts provided under the program exploded — from $5 billion a year to nearly $67 billion in 2023.
That’s not free money, and the discounts to 340B providers are made up by other payers — including the poor, said Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst. 
As the amount of that money grew 13-fold in as many years, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee wanted to know whether 340B was really fulfilling the program’s goal to “stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible.”
The multi-year investigation focused on two hospitals.
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report, which was released last month, said.
The other hospital chain, Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health, will be the subject of a separate story. 
Regarding Cleveland Clinic, the Senate report referred to a 2022 Wall Street Journal story. It said the hospital didn’t admit enough Medicaid and low-income patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
General funds
In analyzing the data the submitted by Cleveland Clinic, the Senate committee found that between April 2020 and June 2023, the hospital chain received $934 million in benefit from the 340B program. Yet, even though the reason for the program’s existence is to support care for people who can’t do so themselves, Cleveland Clinic didn’t use those funds to directly defray patients’ drug costs.
“Cleveland Clinic… explained that it does not pass 340B discounts directly to patients because ‘there is no dollar-for-dollar, pass-on requirement to patients under the 340B statute’ and the statute ‘was intentionally left general to provide safety-net providers with latitude on how they use their savings in the ever-changing health care industry,’” the report said.
Instead, Cleveland Clinic said it “applies its 340B benefit ‘to the health system’s overall operating expenses and revenues in order to offset the cost of providing health care services to the communities [it] serve[s] and to maintain and invest in programs that enhance patient services and access to care.’”
Cleveland Clinic said it didn’t track the 340B millions after putting them in the revenue pot. But it said it spends huge amounts underwriting care for low-income Ohioans.
In 2023, it provided $261 million in free or discounted care to more than 110,000 patients, a spokeswoman said on background. The clinic is the leading provider of Medicaid services, charity care and mental health services in Ohio, she said.
She also pointed out that in 2024, Cleveland Clinic had an operating margin of $276 million, while it spent $261 million discounting care a year earlier. 
However, that excludes income the tax-exempt nonprofit makes from its sizable investments. When you include that, Cleveland Clinic made $911 million in net income in 2023, Healthcare Dive reported.
Also, those narrow operating margins come after paying out hefty salaries.
According to Cleveland Clinic’s 2023 IRS Form 990, President and CEO Tom Mihaljevic was paid $7 million. That was more than 100 times Ohio’s median household income for that year. 
In all, more than 50 of the top decision-makers at Cleveland Clinic made more than $500,000 as they set and enacted a budget subsidized by hundreds of millions of 340B dollars that are notionally meant to support charity care.
“Cleveland Clinic sets executive compensation in accordance with the process developed by the IRS to ensure that such compensation is determined in a fair and impartial manner taking relevant comparative data into account,” the clinic’s spokeswoman said.
Who pays?
In its response to the Senate report, Cleveland Clinic claimed the 340B program doesn’t cost taxpayers.
“As the cost of providing healthcare continues to rise, the 340B program helps us save resources that would have otherwise been spent on purchasing medications but instead can be directed to providing care, at no additional taxpayer expense,” it said.
However, just as others have to pay the taxes nonprofits don’t, drugmakers don’t simply absorb the tens of billions in discounts they’re required to give under the 340B program, said Ciaccia, the drug pricing analyst. In fact, many of the low-income patients the program is supposed to benefit help pay for it.
That’s because those with private insurance — or who are uninsured — don’t pay for drugs on the basis of 340B discounts. They have to pay based on the inflated prices the clinic and its contracted pharmacies charge in order to generate the program’s income.
Everyone with employer-based insurance also pays because those plans also don’t get the 340B discount — or in some cases even a slice of manufacturer rebates they might get in non-340B pharmacy transactions, Ciaccia said. And, as with so many other things, increased insurance costs are usually passed on to consumers.
Ciaccia added that as with rebates, mandatory 340B discounts give drugmakers an incentive to increase the list prices of drugs — increases that are felt most acutely by those who are least able to pay.
“In recent years, the list prices for drugs have arguably exploded, creating greater and greater pressure for government programs, employers, and sick patients to access medicines — not through actual affordable prices — but instead through negotiated or mandated discounts off of those bloated prices,” Ciaccia said. “Programs like 340B double down on our system’s addiction to discounts, pressuring the list prices of medicines higher. But instead of passing those discounts through, the end payer gets stuck with a bloated tab at the pharmacy counter. One way or another, the bill always comes due.”

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.












We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective




But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

Tech giant Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, testified on an Ohio bill to require age verification to download from app stores.
Millions of kids use social media.
“I’m a parent,” Jennifer Hanley, head of safety policy in North America at Meta, said. “I know teens are on so many apps.”
That’s why Hanley headed to the Ohio Statehouse to testify in support of House Bill 226, which would require age verification for all app store purchases or downloads for minors.
“The broad support of parents and lawmakers across political and ideological spectrums should not be ignored,” she said.
State Rep. Melanie Miller, who introduced the bill, said this would hold companies accountable — ones like Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
Manufacturers would need to create a way for parents to give consent for kids under 16 to download any application, and then that will be sent to social media apps.
“I’m introducing this legislation to protect children from harmful content, reduce mental health risks, enhance data privacy, and encourage responsible technology use,” Miller said.
Although House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, likes the bill, she is skeptical of the tech giant.
“All you have to do is look at the opposition that they have waged not only in state legislation in this space, but also federal legislation in this space,” Russo said.
Meta has been filing lawsuits against social media age requirements across the country, including in Ohio. The state legislature passed restrictions on media apps for kids under 16 in 2023, but it has now been blocked by a federal judge due to free speech concerns.
This bill is different because it is not just targeting social media apps, but all apps, Hanley testified.
Attorney General Dave Yost filed a lawsuit, saying that the company used “manipulative tactics to entice teens and tweens.”
Russo agrees, adding that the company could be doing much more to protect kids.
“Do I think that it is going to be as effective as some of the other things we know they have the capacity to do using their own algorithms?” she said rhetorically. “Probably not.”
Only in the past year, Meta created a teen program to monitor and restrict what minors can access and who they can talk to.
“We’re always learning, we’re always building,” Hanley said. “Teen accounts are a really great example of that.”
The bill will continue being heard in the coming months.

(Eric Thomas illustration for Kansas Reflector)In one way, this is the easiest column I’ve written. 
It’s simple to celebrate public media in Kansas: public radio, educational television, veteran journalists, original reporting, local focus, innovative podcasts and more. For all that, I’m a long-time sustaining member of my local public radio station. And I have written many glowing columns about NPR journalism. Public media in Kansas is awesome.
In another way, this column is tricky. Defending anyone, let alone an institution, from fraudulent attacks is challenging. It’s proving a negative, when the negative is certifiably bonkers. And coming from the White House.
Here goes.
On Tuesday, National Public Radio and three public radio stations sued the Trump administration in response to the May 1 executive order that sought to strip public media of its funding in the United States.
The NPR lawsuit, filed in the District of Columbia, asserts that Trump’s executive order “violates the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment’s bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association, and also threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information.”
The 43-page filing pokes holes in Trump’s executive order: a brazen attempt to extinguish public media throughout the country — and harm its audience in Kansas — based on a partisan grudge.
Under even brief inspection, Trump’s May 1 executive order and the press statements that accompanied it look inept.
They read like the half-baked political flailing of the first Trump administration when the rationale for his decisions was foolish and risible.
Just like many of the actions of the first Trump administration, there is a more principled and legal argument to be made here: Persuade Congress to defund public broadcasting because taxpayer money simply doesn’t belong in the media. The executive order only fleetingly expresses that viewpoint: “Government funding of news media in this environment is not only outdated and unnecessary but corrosive to the appearance of journalistic independence.”
More often, the White House falsely accuses public radio. It dishes out fake news about the real news.
If not opposed by a lawsuit like the one filed Tuesday, Trump’s executive order would wreck two valuable American institutions for petty and deceptive reasons: hot-button word choices, political innuendo and pet peeves.
What’s Trump’s best response for NPR’s regret at labeling someone as “illegal” in their reporting? Defund NPR.
What’s Trump’s best response to PBS’s documentary about a transgender teen? Defund PBS.
Forever a predatory real estate developer, Trump wants to tear down public media rather than putting money into improvements.
This week’s NPR lawsuit points us to documents that reveal Trump’s pettiness toward public media. First, consider “President Trump Finally Ends the Madness of NPR, PBS,” a press release published by the White House in conjunction with the executive order.
We find 24 bullet point examples of “trash that has passed for ‘news’ at NPR and PBS.” Many of the bullet points, stripped of context, completely misrepresent each instance of public media reporting.
One bullet point links to an NPR audio chat from 2022, headlined: “Which skin color emoji should you use? The answer can be more complex than you think.” During the discussion, the NPR host says, “These are not particularly easy questions for people to wrestle with.” The guest replies, “I completely agree with you that there is no clear-cut answer.”
How did the White House boil down this nuanced discussion of race? The press release says, “NPR assigned three reporters to investigate how the thumbs-up emoji is racist.”
NPR never used the word racist.
Summarizing the coverage in that way isn’t a political distortion. It’s a lie.
Here’s another White House claim from the same press release: “NPR routinely promotes the chemical and surgical mutilation of children as so-called ‘gender-affirming care’ without mentioning the irreversible damage caused by these procedures.” This bullet point links to a 2023 story from Florida by Melissa Block.
It’s a mind-bending stretch to see NPR as “promoting” medical care for trans kids in this journalism. The writer quotes experts — medical groups, plus an endocrinologist and a psychologist — as they each endorse the medical care.
Dear White House media critics, covering an issue is not to promote one side.
When the administration isn’t misrepresenting the work of public media, it nitpicks political language. In the press release’s final bullet point, the White House writes about the “PBS show Sesame Street partnered with CNN on a one-sided narrative to ‘address racism’ amid the Black Lives Matter riots.”
One-sided narrative? I wondered.
Clicking the link takes you to a cheerful image of Sesame Street characters with the title, “Coming Together: Standing Up to Racism.” What is the other side of racism that the White House wants represented here? Pro-racism?
The White House should be pressured to explain the “other side” of the debate that it is imagining, not Big Bird and PBS.
(The most likely true objection to this program? Sesame Street partnered with CNN, a network Trump would defund if he could.)
Taken as a whole, the list reads like a vendetta seeking a motive: Let’s destroy public media, but first we need a reason.
Given the White House’s complaints about news coverage in their press release, it seems that the executive order is in fact retaliation. Or, consider how the NPR lawyers metaphorically put it:
“It is not always obvious when the government has acted with a retaliatory purpose in violation of the First Amendment. ‘But this wolf comes as a wolf.’ … The Order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President’s view, their news and other content is not ‘fair, accurate, or unbiased.’ ”
And yet, there’s more. Multiplying the unfairness of the lawsuit and executive order is the fundamental fairness of NPR’s news coverage. As a journalism instructor at the University of Kansas, I use NPR resources in my classroom precisely because they are among the most trustworthy and unbiased.
It’s not just me who sees it this way. Say what you will of the charts that organize media organizations in terms of bias; NPR is one of the most centrist sources, regardless of which media critics you trust.
“Our people report straight down the line,” said NPR CEO Katherine Maher during an appearance on CBS. “I think that not only do they do that, they do that with a mission that very few other broadcast organizations have, which is a requirement to serve the entire public. That is the point of public broadcasting. We bring people together in those conversations.”
During the past few weeks, as public media has defended itself against these garbage attacks, Trump’s order has been characterized as a disproportionate attack on people who live in rural areas, including large swaths of Kansas.
The faces of this defense have been the CEOs of NPR and the Public Broadcasting System. Each has stressed how rural audiences will suffer.
On Tuesday, Maher released a statement that repeatedly stressed the NPR’s nationwide virtue of “serving all 50 states and territories” as a source for “tens of millions of Americans.”
“Without public dollars, NPR’s investment in rural reporting initiatives, collaborative regional newsrooms, and award-winning international coverage would all be at risk,” Maher wrote.
Lisa Rodriguez, interim director of content for KCUR, an affiliate station in Kansas City, appeared on the station’s “Up To Date” show to explain how small rural member stations rely on NPR.
“For KCUR, you depend on it for what you hear every day,” Rodriguez said. “But also at these smaller stations, you don’t have as rich a local journalism ecosystem. It is sometimes the only news that is reaching small communities.”
To call the White House’s arguments weak should not minimize their gravity. The consequences of the executive order would be catastrophic, especially to Kansans, if they hold up in court.
Through the rhetoric of this executive order and its press release, Trump relishes in playing the schoolyard bully once again. This time he is not so much name calling or picking on the vulnerable. With public media, he threatens to take his ball, go home and leave Kansans stranded.
Why? The bully doesn’t like the way the game is being played.
However, as the lawsuit makes clear, it is not his ball. And he has no right to take it.
NPR and its fellow plaintiffs seek their continuing independence in their lawsuit. They quote a legal precedent that interpreted NPR’s founding legislation as creating an “elaborate structure … to insulate (broadcasters) from government interference.”
Later, the suit continues, that while “Congress is not obligated to support independent public radio with federal funds,” the government cannot remove funding in a way that unconstitutionally infringes on free speech.
Unfortunately, our current Congress does not appear willing to reassert itself against Trump’s hallucinatory rhetoric and orders.  
This week’s lawsuit and its path through the courts may be the only remedy to save public broadcasting in Kansas.

After our conversation that day, I knew kismet had found us — a shared bulldog energy for public accountability against corruption combusting in our professional cores.
Hard-nosed and never afraid of confrontation, but not militant or hateful, this energy is fueled not by fear, contempt, vengeance, or resentment, but an absolute love and commitment to community, humanity, truth, justice, and public service.
Having for years read and admired the work of longtime Editor Terry Smith, Jim Phillips, and Nick Claussen, I knew quickly after my interviews with Terry and Bruce that The Athens NEWS would mean something in my life.

Perhaps, though, I didn’t fully recognize how deep and profound its meaning until just last weekend, when many of us were reunited in Athens to celebrate Bruce’s life and legacy following his passing on April 29 at the age of 71.
As I watched a slideshow last Saturday of Bruce living this joyful, fiercely unique, caring, heart-forward, service-oriented, wildly colorful life, I could not help but be struck by the force and magnitude of all that he and Terry had built. Of course, many others helped, from Bruce’s wonderful wife Susan and his business partner Guy Philips, to the countless reporters, staff and sales reps, graphics people and photographers who contributed so much along the way.
I joined the NEWS at the very start of 2009, after Terry hired me as a new staff reporter over the holidays.
I had been a student reporter for the campus bureau of the paper during my senior year at Ohio University. I used those first crucial professional clips to obtain an internship in Washington D.C., which turned into a job at the National Journal’s The Hotline. That led to a job for the New York Observer’s Politicker covering the 2008 campaign cycle in then-battleground Ohio. After the election was over, they laid us all off.
I needed a new reporting job, and wanted to gain a wider variety of coverage experience. Terry was looking for a reporter with political coverage chops. Bruce had already been printing the news and raising hell for more than three decades as publisher of The Athens NEWS, which he founded in 1977, fresh after graduating from Ohio University and raising plenty of hell as a campus leader and activist.
While I was an undergrad, I read every twice-weekly edition of The Athens NEWS.
I loved — and still love — the tactile quality of flipping through a physical newspaper: the feel, the sound, the smell, the vibe. The Athens NEWS was free, ubiquitous around the campus and city, and useful. With no smartphones back then, every Monday and Thursday I would sit down to lunch at one of the dining halls and read the whole thing.
From the NEWS, I knew every event at every venue every weekend throughout the city and county. I knew all the bands, all the players, all the local personalities, the best bars and food spots, the best deals, all the clubs and activities, all the festivals, all the opportunities.
I knew everything Ohio University was up to, and anything nefarious the administration might be trying to pull. I knew everything the city and county was up to as well, and anything untoward any local officials might be trying to pull. I knew the crime, I knew the scandals.
When I joined the full-time team, it was a blessing: With Bruce’s passionate, tireless crusade against public corruption and injustice of any kind, I knew I had the freedom to be the best bulldog reporter I could be.
With Jim Phillips’ extraordinary, polished, and excellent example, I could study a master reporter at work. And with Terry Smith’s steady-handed, level-headed, practical, insightful, inquisitive mentorship and guidance, I learned everything I ever needed to know about how to run a newsroom like a true pro.
I expected to be at The Athens NEWS for two years. I ended up staying for nine.
We held powerful local politicians accountable to the people, and Ohio University accountable to its students and the larger community. We exposed schemes, scams, and abuse.
We did all the everyday reporting that the community needed. We featured everybody making a positive impact, told our readers the heartbreaking truth about poverty and all its attendant ills in Appalachia, exposed predatory landlords and corrupt politicians, and produced every kind of special issue, student and visitor guide imaginable. I got to write everything from restaurant reviews and Goo Goo Dolls interviews, to deeply reported issue coverage of addiction in Southeast Ohio.
While Terry ran the show in the newsroom — ever-balancing Bruce’s intensity and more feverish ideas with Terry’s own steady and serious news judgment — behind the operation as a whole stood Bruce, a pied-piper with a wild tie and funny hat, deepening community connections, leading our march in the Halloween parade, handing out turkeys at Thanksgiving and trees at Christmas, taking us to Cincinnati for Reds games, throwing birthday pizza parties, insisting relentlessly on fun.
He was one-of-a-kind, never meant for mass production, and others have written lovely tributes outlining the many memorable stories about Bruce and the wonderful things he accomplished, including former reporter Miles Layton and longtime Athens NEWS columnist Dennis E. Powell.
In my time there, I got all the invaluable reporting experience I craved, covering local government, crime and the courts, education, health care, energy and the environment, natural disasters, public corruption, protests and riots.
After working first in D.C. and then Columbus, I finally saw and learned how policy impacts Ohioans’ lives at the ground level. I’d been in their homes. I’d heard their stories. I’d witnessed their tears.
What happens at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus is not theoretical to me; I know the repercussions in my heart — I know the faces of the people being harmed.
And perhaps therein lies the source of my largest debt of gratitude to Bruce, Terry, Jim, and the whole rest of the entire Athens NEWS team over the years.
Everything I learned there became a part of me. I carry it all within me now, at the Ohio Capital Journal, with my own team.
So last Saturday, as I sat there in my beloved Athens, reunited for this celebration of life, a wave of gratitude, appreciation, and admiration crashed over me.
What a helluva great and noble thing Bruce had done, creating The Athens NEWS and building it into the beautiful community newspaper that it was.
Over the decades, an upstart alternative newsweekly became, by the time Bruce retired in 2015 — and for five years after through Terry and Conor Morris — what ought to always be remembered as an absolute powerhouse of local Ohio journalism.
Fair, fearless, free, fact-based reporting for the people.
Those are actually the mission taglines for the Ohio Capital Journal, but they may as well have been the taglines for The Athens NEWS. I realize now that this whole ethos was inspired and ingrained in me during my time there. And by some wild grace I have the good fortune to continue on with it with States Newsroom, dedicated only to doing the best journalism possible.
Before I left Bruce’s celebration of life last Saturday, having reflected on all of this, I made sure to tell Susan how grateful I was for the role that she and Bruce and The Athens NEWS played in my life, and how fortunate I feel to be able to try to continue some of that legacy today with the work of the Ohio Capital Journal.
Graceful and gracious as ever, Susan gave me a hug and told me that Bruce had followed our work at the Capital Journal and he was proud. That made my eyes well up. I hadn’t seen Bruce in the years after I moved to Columbus and they moved to Key West, but I knew that if he ever read the Capital Journal then he would’ve recognized various reflections of the kind of work we did at the NEWS. That made me smile.
Bruce was a man who cared passionately about others and cared passionately about justice and community. He lived with joy, loved deeply, fought corruption relentlessly, and poured himself into his community with no reservations. He was a wild man, with a great big honest heart, and to me, that counts for everything. Bravo, my friend.

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Local school systems straining to comply with the state’s sweeping Blueprint for Maryland’s Future have had to report to both the Maryland Department of Education and the Blueprint’s Accountability and Implementation Board, a setup creating confusion “since the get-go.”
Now, more than three years into the process, the two agencies said they are working on a memorandum of understanding that could make things a bit smoother for all concerned.
Alex Reese, chief of staff with the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), did not tell the state Board of Education on Thursday how long it would take to finalize an agreement, but he said a memorandum is in the works.
State law requires the seven-member AIB to oversee the 10-year plan and approve any Blueprint documents submitted by the state’s 24 school systems and other state agencies that craft elements of the Blueprint.
The law also requires the department to provide technical assistance and lend expertise on education policy. The AIB and state Board of Education also hold occasional joint meetings and approve certain policies associated with the multibillion-dollar Blueprint plan.
Reese said “MSDE will be fully owning Blueprint implementation. We feel good about that as practitioners. We really do feel like we possess that expertise to be able to be poised to fully implementing the Blueprint.”
An AIB spokesperson confirmed in an email Thursday evening an agreement is being worked on with the department.
“AIB and MSDE attorneys are working together on an MOU [memorandum of understanding] relating to the agencies’ respective roles and duties,” the spokesperson said.
‘Blueprint’ bill that avoids some of the most severe education cuts is signed into law

“There is not currently a timeline confirmed for finalizing it. Because it is an MOU directly between the AIB and MSDE, there would be no need for General Assembly approval,” the email said.
In a quick summation to the state board Thursday, Reese said certain processes will remain the same such as the Blueprint board providing instructions to school systems on what is required in each Blueprint plan. It will continue “interagency collaboration” with agencies such as the state Higher Education Commission, which focuses on two of the Blueprint’s five pillars, or priorities – hiring and retaining high-quality and diverse teachers, and preparing students for college and technical careers.
The news was welcomed by school leaders, educators and advocates who have expressed frustration over the process of implementing the comprehensive education reform plan.
“One of the biggest complaints, if not the biggest, has been the lack of clarity and final guidance and where we get questions answered. We’ve got to run every decision by both entities [MSDE and AIB],” said Mary Pat Fannon, executive director of the Public School Superintendents’ Association of Maryland.
The association released a 12-page document in December that outlined proposals to help improve the plan. One of those recommendations was clearing up the relationship between the two agencies.
“Restructuring and clarifying the relationship of the MSDE and AIB would be very beneficial in the implementation of the Blueprint. This change would clarify roles and responsibilities, and establish clear guidance to the LEAs [local education agencies, or school systems] that they are governed by the procedures and processes promulgated by the MSDE and the State Board,” the December report said.
“Somebody’s got to be the point. Somebody’s got to be the team captain on certain things,” Fannon said.  “Otherwise, it’s just completely frustrating.”
“We are happy they are doing this. This is all going to help in implementation when these guys are 100% clear with us,” Fannon said of the work on an MOU.
Sen. Mary Beth Carozza (R-Lower Shore) was also pleased by the discussions, which she said would help improve the process at the local and state levels. But the senator hopes an agreement can be reached before the 2025-26 school year begins in the fall.
“I would like to think they would make every effort to use the time between now and [when] school starts to give as much clarity to the roles and responsibilities, since it will only have a positive impact at the local level,” Carozza said. “That would be my expectation to keep that on track and to keep it moving.”

A lawsuit filed this week hopes to change that. (File photo William J. Ford/Maryland Matters.)Five Maryland voters who are not affiliated with any political party filed a lawsuit this week asking a state judge to declare the state’s restrictions on primary elections a violation of the state constitution.
Maryland, which has a partially closed primary system, requires voters to affiliate with the Democratic or Republican party if they want to vote in the primary election. The five unaffiliated voters, represented by Republican former Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, said the elections — paid for with tax dollars — are a violation of their right to vote.
“The point is, it really is a voting rights issue,” Rutherford, who is now an attorney with Davis, Agnor, Rapaport & Skalny in Columbia, said in an interview. “It’s not an attack on the parties. It’s a question of what is fair for 22% — over a fifth of the voting population — approaching 25% of the voting population that has chosen not to be affiliated.”
  Former Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford (R) is representing a group of unaffiliated voters in a lawsuit challenging the state’s closed primary system. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters.)
The 15-page lawsuit filed in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court on behalf of the five unaffiliated voters challenges the current primary election system. All five said they were barred from voting in the 2022 and 2024 primary elections because they opted not to affiliate with either major political party.
Requiring party affiliation to vote creates a barrier of “partisan primaries that the state endorses and supports and funds, which is contrary to the plain reading of the state constitution and the Declaration of Rights,” Rutherford said.
It is a subject with which Rutherford has some personal experience. In 2015, Rutherford told The Washington Post that he was a registered independent but changed his affiliation to Democrat to vote in primary elections in the District of Columbia.
A spokesperson for the Maryland State Board of Elections did not provide a comment on the suit pending litigation.
John Willis, who served as secretary of state under Gov. Parris N. Glendening, and is a professor of public affairs at the University of Baltimore, said the lawsuit is misplaced.
“Primary elections are for political parties. They’re not for 4 million individual voters,” said Willis, who is also an attorney. “They’re a process for nominating candidates for a general election. The whole notion that they’re somehow open to everybody, the public — there’s no constitutional right to that.”
Unaffiliated voters in Maryland can cast votes in state primaries for nonpartisan races such as the election of judges and school board members.
But. the voters in the lawsuit compare the process to “taxpayers funding the selection of officers to private clubs or in this case private entities.”

	Rutherford said it is the use of taxpayer dollars that conflicts with his clients’ rights.
“We’re just saying the state should not be paying for it, because the state would be paying for something that’s unconstitutional,” Rutherford said. “This is, again, it’s a voting rights question, so the state should not be supporting something that is unconstitutional.”
In Maryland, the number of voters who identify as unaffiliated has grown to nearly one in five voters in the state. Willis said that growth is a “legitimate thing to talk about.”
“But I don’t think it’s a lawsuit. I think it’s a political debate or a philosophical debate. It’s an OK political debate to have, but I don’t think it’s a legal constitutional debate.”
To Willis, the appropriate venue for making a change is the legislature.
Rutherford, in an interview, said the legislature is unlikely to make those changes.
“I don’t think the legislature sees it in their interest, even though they should, because it is a question of voting rights,” Rutherford said. We think the courts need to take it up, just like the Voting Rights Act or Brown versus Board of Education. The legislature alone is not going to do it.”
Willis said the current political system dates back more than 100 years. “Since the Civil War, in Maryland, we’ve been a two-party system,” he said.

Legislation sponsored in 2023 by Sen. Cheryl C. Kagan (D-Montgomery) called for allowing unaffiliated voters to affiliate with a party as late as the day before the start of early voting.
Kagan, who was not available for an interview, said in 2023 testimony that many unaffiliated voters “do not understand our closed primary system.” Then, when they arrive to vote, they are told they can vote in nonpartisan races. That sometimes causes voters to become “frustrated — and sometimes quite angry,” Kagan’s written testimony said.
Her bill and an identical House bill both died in their respective committees.
In 2000, the Maryland Republican Party did briefly change its rules to let unaffiliated voters cast ballots in its presidential primary. The change was short-lived.
A spokesperson for the Maryland Democratic Party declined to comment on the pending lawsuit. A representative of the Maryland Republican Party was not immediately available for comment.
The lawsuit is backed by the Open Primaries Education Fund, a nonprofit that advocates for allowing unaffiliated voters to participate in primary elections. The group also promotes the use of litigation toward that goal.
Rutherford said the group and its local affiliate reached out to him about challenging the state primary system after the two-term lieutenant governor authored an opinion piece calling for allowing unaffiliated or independent voters to participate in primary elections.
And while the debate over Maryland’s primary system is not new, Rutherford said the lawsuit is novel in its approach.
“It’s been challenged in other states, one, generally in the federal courts. Not as much so in the state courts,” said Rutherford, adding that he believes there has never been a challenge under the Maryland Constitution.
The constitution, Rutherford said, sets out specific rules for qualifying voters. Maryland residents 18 years old and older “shall be entitled to vote at every election, all elections,” Rutherford said.
“They said all elections,” Rutherford said. “Nowhere in the constitution does it state anything about primaries or political parties or anything of that notion. And then the Declaration of Rights, which is part of the constitution, goes further by stating that it talks about the right of suffrage.”
Maryland is one of nine states that have a partially closed primary system, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In such systems, the parties can choose to allow unaffiliated voters to vote in their respective primary elections.
Seven states are considered open to unaffiliated voters. Those systems allow unaffiliated voters to vote in the party primary of their choice. Voters who are affiliated with a political party must vote in that party’s primary.
Another 15 states have open primaries — voters are not asked to affiliate with a party. Voters can then choose which primary they wish to cast a ballot in.

(Maryland Matters file photo)The Trump administration on Thursday said Maryland and several of its counties and cities are sanctuary jurisdictions for immigrants, a designation that will bring a warning from federal officials along with a vague threat of the loss of unspecified federal funds.
The Maryland governments were among more than 500 jurisdictions nationwide, including states and local governments, labeled sanctuary jurisdictions by the Department of Homeland Security, in response to an April 28 executive order by President Donald Trump (R).
Sanctuary jurisdictions come in many forms, but they are generally governments with policies that limit the ability of local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration agencies. Supporters say the policies make local communities safer by increasing immigrant trust in local police agencies and making them more willing to work with police.
But Trump, in his executive order, said sanctuary policies “violate, obstruct, and defy the enforcement of Federal immigration laws” in a “lawless insurrection against the supremacy of Federal law.” The order directs the attorney general and the secretary of Homeland Security to contact jurisdictions on the list, and it further requires federal agency heads to identify grants, contracts and other funds that could be withheld from the jurisdictions “as appropriate.”
The Homeland Security list tagged the state of Maryland, eight counties and 10 municipalities. The department said it determined whether a government was a sanctuary jurisdiction “by factors like compliance with federal law enforcement, information restrictions, and legal protections for illegal aliens.”
The department labeled Maryland as a “Self-Identification as a State Sanctuary Jurisdiction,” but doesn’t summarize what that entails.

“DHS demands that these jurisdictions immediately review and revise their policies to align with Federal immigration laws and renew their obligation to protect American citizens, not dangerous illegal aliens,” the department’s statement said.
Despite the administration’s repeated claim that sanctuary policies violate federal law or obstruct federal immigration enforcement, the policies do neigher. And local officials were already pushing back Thursday against threats from federal officials.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) released a statement Thursday that mentions the possibility of suing the administration, after his city was listed as a sanctuary jurisdiction.
“To be clear: by definition, Baltimore is not a sanctuary city, because we do not have jurisdiction over our jails. We follow our limited obligations as defined under federal immigration law,” Scott said.
“But we are a welcoming city, and we make no apologies for that,” his statement said. “We are better because of our immigrant neighbors, and we are not about to sell them out to this administration.”
Six of the 10 Maryland municipalities the department designated as sanctuary cities are in Prince George’s County: the towns of Cheverly and Edmonston, and the cities of College Park, Greenbelt, Hyattsville and Mount Rainier.
Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), chair of the Legislative Latino Caucus, said in a text message Thursday night that labels such as “sanctuary jurisdiction” oversimplify work done to serve and protect residents.
“Maryland, Prince George’s County and our municipalities have long embraced policies that create welcoming, inclusive communities where all residents – regardless of immigration status – can live with dignity and safety,” Martinez said. “These local approaches are rooted in public trust, safety and effective governance, not political defiance.”
In addition to Baltimore City, the other Maryland cities on the list are Annapolis in Anne Arundel County, and Rockville and Takoma Park in Montgomery County. Maryland counties on the DHS list were Anne Arundel, Baltimore County, Charles, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Queen Anne’s and Talbot.
Maryland does offer limited benefits to undocumented immigrants in the state, including the ability to get a driver’s license and to be able to buy health insurance in the state marketplace under some circumstances. But state lawmakers also approved a watered-down version of an immigration bill last month, in the final minutes of the 2025 legislative session,
That bill was originally going to prohibit so-called 287(g) agreements, which allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to delegate some federal enforcement authorities to local officers. But the Senate stripped that language out and the House relented. The final version of the bill, which becomes law Sunday, gives limited protection against immigration actions in “sensitive locations,” such as churches, schools or hospitals.

,California,2025-05-30 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom tussles with local officials over homelessness,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/newsom-homelessness-california-local/,"As Newsom and legislators fashion a new state budget, verbal exchanges between him and local officials about who is to blame have become sharper.","Throughout Gavin Newsom’s governorship, he and local government officials have been squabbling over financial support and accountability for programs to reduce California’s largest-in-the-nation homelessness crisis.
Simply put, Newsom has blamed local officials for not clearing their streets of squalid encampments, while they have complained that piecemeal state appropriations make it impossible to create effective ongoing programs.
With Newsom and state legislators in the final throes of fashioning a new state budget, and facing chronic gaps between income and outgo, the verbal exchanges between the governor and local officialdom have become sharper and the differences between county and city officials have become more obvious.
While homelessness is largely found within cities, particularly large cities, county governments operate most of the medical and social programs to combat the syndrome, leading to conflicts over which local government should be held accountable.
The division among local governments is a statewide problem, but it is most apparent in Los Angeles County, where a joint city-county homelessness agency is being dismantled amid sharp criticism of its failures.
When he unveiled his latest version of the budget this month, Newsom pledged to ramp up pressure on the locals by introducing new accountability processes and conditioning state aid on identifiable results. He also proposed a model ordinance he said local governments could use to clear encampments.
“No one in our nation should be without a place to call home. As we continue to support our communities in addressing homelessness, we expect fast results, not excuses,” Newsom said in a statement. “While we are pleased by the progress many communities have made to address the homelessness crisis, there is more work to do.”
County officials responded combatively, reiterating their position that year-by-year financial support from the state undermines their efforts. They proposed a five-year experiment, dubbed AT HOME, in which multi-year financing would be assured in counties that cooperatively delineate responsibilities for specific programs among local governments.
The California State Association of Counties also released an analysis of nearly $30 billion in state spending on housing and homelessness during Newsom’s governorship that it says failed to be effective.
“For years, the state has thrown one-time money at this problem without any real strategy,” Jeff Griffiths, an Inyo County supervisor and president of the association, said in a statement. “Our AT HOME proposal is credible, comprehensive, and directly addresses the state-imposed barriers to reducing homelessness. It’s time to act.”
The Big City Mayors coalition adopted a more conciliatory response to Newsom’s latest crackdown threat, releasing an “accountability update” to highlight what it said had been successful uses of annual state grants and asking Newsom and legislators to renew them.
“I’ve seen firsthand how our cities use (homeless) funds effectively to address homelessness,” the coalition’s chair, Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson, said in a statement. “In Riverside, we’ve reached functional zero for youth homelessness — ensuring every young person aged 18 to 24 has a path off the street.
 “With 94 permanent supportive housing units in the pipeline for vulnerable populations like veterans and individuals with disabilities, we know that real progress is possible. But it takes continued partnership between the state and our cities to keep this momentum going and continue delivering meaningful results.”
The blame game is likely to escalate, even as homelessness continues to fester, the voting public becomes more frustrated and Newsom’s governorship enters its final stage.
When the history of California’s homelessness crisis is written, who will be held accountable for the eventual outcome, either positive or negative?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625-Fremont-Homeless-Encampment-BANG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-30 03:59:13.535955

A[...]","Lawmakers created a long list of study committees during the 2025 legislative session, laying the groundwork for a busy offseason. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSchool may be out for the summer, but at the state Capitol in Atlanta, lawmakers are gearing up for their own version of summer school. Study committees, which meet outside the regular 40-day legislative session, have already begun gathering information and soliciting expert testimony on topics ranging from chronic student absenteeism to improving tourism.
All told, 16 different House study committees and 20 Senate panels will convene under the Gold Dome, which is the most each chamber has seen in the past decade. Here is a look at a few notable ones. 
Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence, or AI, has been a hot-button issue both in Georgia and around the country. During the 2025 session, legislators in both chambers introduced bills aimed at increasing regulations on the use of AI technology, but none managed to pass through both chambers by the Sine Die deadline.
However, two new study committees will allow legislators in the Senate to continue compiling research and drafting a report that may guide their efforts when lawmakers reconvene for the 2026 session next January. Senate Resolution 391, introduced by Roswell Republican Sen. John Albers, creates a new committee dedicated to examining the use of AI across industries like education, health care and financial services. The committee will also explore the use of digital and cryptocurrency, and how to better prevent security threats.
A second AI-related committee, created by SR 431, will study the impact of social media on children across Georgia, examining privacy implications and the impact of chatbots and other AI features on minors. The resolution was introduced by Atlanta Democrat Sen. Sally Harrell, who will serve as co-chair alongside Johns Creek Republican Sen. Shawn Still. 
Elections
Lawmakers are getting a jump start on election policy this year, perhaps hoping to avoid a repeat of the months-long battle between Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the five-member State Election Board that characterized the lead-up to Georgia’s 2024 election. 
House Resolution 885 established a special panel that will examine Georgia’s existing election code and how responsibilities are shared between election officials at the local and state levels. It will be chaired by Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican. 
Another study committee, created by SR 429, will research ways to remove barriers for those who are seeking to restore their voting rights after a felony conviction. Georgia “has one of the longest parole and probationary periods in the nation and the highest number of individuals under supervision per capita of any state,” according to the resolution. 
Insurance rates
The fight to overhaul Georgia’s civil litigation landscape may be settled for now, but discussions over Georgia’s insurance rates are set to continue. A newly created panel will investigate the driving forces behind insurance rate hikes throughout the state by analyzing insurance industry practices, profit margins and compliance with state regulations. It will be chaired by Duluth Republican Rep. Matt Reeves.
House lawmakers will also delve into how the state’s reinsurance landscape intersects with climate change in a study committee created by HR 40. Citing the estimated $6.46 billion in damage that Hurricane Helene caused in Georgia, lawmakers are hoping to combat insurance-related challenges that businesses may face during future storms and severe weather events.
Co-chaired by Republican Reps. Darlene Taylor of Thomasville and Noel Williams of Cordele, the committee aims to collaborate with the Georgia Office of Insurance and Department of Agriculture to mitigate rising property and casualty insurance costs for small businesses across the state.
Medical cannabis
Cannabis consumption, both medical and recreational, was another prominent issue that surfaced during the 2025 legislative session. While House Bill 227 and Senate Bill 220 both sought to widen access to medical cannabis, neither bill managed to make it over the finish line before lawmakers adjourned for the year. Instead, two separate study committees will tackle the issue over the summer.
A House study committee led by Augusta Republican Rep. Mark Newton, who works as a doctor, will dive into Georgia’s medical marijuana policies. In the Senate, lawmakers on the Study Committee on Intoxicating Cannabinoids in Consumable Hemp Products will tackle the issue of regulating recreational products like THC-infused drinks, which are chemically similar to medical cannabis but more broadly available to consumers because they fall under the federal 2018 Farm Bill and the Georgia Hemp Farming Act.
State income tax
Georgia lawmakers at both the state and federal level are pushing for legislation that would overhaul the current tax code, replacing the current system with a fixed consumption tax that proponents refer to as “FairTax.” The congressional version of the bill, which was first proposed in 1999, was sponsored this year by U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, who recently announced a bid for the U.S. Senate.
At the Georgia Capitol, the Senate State FairTax Study Committee will examine similar legislation that would apply a fixed sales tax rate within the Peach State. The committee will be chaired by Rome Republican Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, who also heads the Senate Finance Committee.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma House rose for a standing ovation Thursday after overturning the governor’s veto of a bill expanding access to mammograms for early breast cancer detection. 
Rep. Melissa Provenzano, D-Tulsa, the bill’s author, said the standing ovation was “powerful” and a reminder that people are humans before they are politicians. She was battling breast cancer for the length of the legislative session. 
Despite a nearly five hour delay in the Senate, the measure was one of nearly four dozen vetoes the House and Senate overturned on the penultimate day of session as they worked past midnight and into Friday morning before adjourning. Lawmakers moved to overturn the majority of Stitt’s vetoes.

Provenzano was met with another round of applause Thursday night when she returned to the House chamber after the Senate voted to finalize the veto override. 
“I’m just reminded again, that we’re humans first, politicians second,” Provenzano said. “And I think every member and every staff member and the people in this building, if what we experienced here is going on in the state of Oklahoma, then it’s time for something like this. Because everybody had a story of a sister or a mother, an aunt, a wife. And so it was just powerful.” 
Stitt said he vetoed the bill because while he is “sympathetic” to those battling breast cancer, the legislation would have imposed “new and costly” insurance mandates on private health plans and raised insurance premiums. 
To override a veto from the governor, two-thirds of representatives and senators must vote in favor of the measure or three-quarters if the measure contains an emergency provision. The dozens of overrides ranged from measures that aimed to increase public access to open records to missing and murdered indigenous people.
Some of the measures lawmakers vetoed included: 

House Bill 2785 that gives the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services the ability to review the budget and finances of the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, which has had ongoing financial troubles. The governor said it was “nonsensical and ineffective” to task one executive agency with micromanaging another; 
House Bill 2163 that gives the Attorney General’s Office the power to enforce violations of the Open Records Act. Stitt said the bill would give Attorney General Gentner Drummond “sweeping and unchecked authority” to access records from all state agencies, an “unprecedented” power in Oklahoma. Drummond had previously urged lawmakers to override the veto;
House Bill 2048 that prohibits insurers and pharmacy benefit managers from discriminatory reimbursement practices. Stitt wrote in his veto message that this was a federal issue and the Legislature should not insert itself. 
House Bill 1137 that removes a requirement that the Office of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons be federally funded, opening it up to state funding. Stitt said he vetoed the measure because he doesn’t endorse legislation that “singles out victims based solely on their race.” 

Stitt posted a video Thursday afternoon telling voters to closely watch how lawmakers vote on veto overrides. 
“This is stuff I know is bad for Oklahoma, bad for taxpayers,” he said in the video. “And you’ve got the Senate and House and special interest groups that are trying to override my vetoes.”

Stitt said Thursday that he had vetoed 68 bills this session that would overregulate businesses and create higher taxes for Oklahomans. He said voters should pay attention to which lawmakers supported overrides of his vetoes.
Rep. Scott Fetgatter, R-Okmulgee, referenced Stitt’s comments while making a motion to override a veto on one of his bills, House Bill 2459, which pertains to fire safety in mobile food vehicles. 
“Evidently, since the governor has called for all of us to be primaried that override his vetoes today, and his staff cant seem to read a bill correctly and they vetoed my bill, I make a motion to override the veto,” he said. 
National guard bill dispute draws out legislative day
Legislative proceedings stalled for nearly five hours after Senate leaders struggled to get the required number of votes necessary to override House Bill 2769. The measure contained a series of amendments to the leadership requirements and rules of the Oklahoma National Guard. The Senate passed the override just after 9 p.m. 
Stitt’s override message said he vetoed the bill because it made major changes to the National Guard and state finances without a thorough fiscal analysis. 
“While I applaud all our men and women who serve our country and our state in the National Guard, I cannot allow this bill to become law,” he wrote. “… The policies in this bill should be considered, reviewed, and debated as separate and distinct bills.”
The bill makes several amendments to the qualifications necessary to serve as adjutant general of the Oklahoma National Guard, an officer overseeing administrative and personnel matters. The position could now be filled by someone with a rank of colonel or higher. It also grants the officer additional powers. 
The officer is to be compensated at the same rate of pay afforded to a major general. Several changes were also made to the Oklahoma Uniform Code of Military Justice.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Lawmakers overnight Thursday voted to fire the state’s embattled mental health commissioner.
Saying that they had “lost confidence” in Allie Friesen’s ability to lead the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, legislators voted overwhelmingly to remove her effective immediately.
It marked the first time in recent history that lawmakers had taken such a step. 
The move follows a series of legislative hearings probing financial disarray at the agency, which is responsible for a budget of more than $700 million. 
Lawmakers had to make a multi-million dollar emergency appropriation to cover payroll and ensure contracts were fulfilled, while the state auditor recently released a critical audit. 
The legislative maneuver drew the ire of Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt who has continued to defend Friesen. He called it a “politically motivated witch hunt.”
Stitt said he tasked Friesen to bring accountability and transparency to the agency and suggested the mismanagement went back a decade or more.
“She disturbed the status quo and questioned long held practices at the agency,” Stitt said. “An agency rife with sweetheart deals and criminal elements was disrupted, and now elected officials are quickly working to set the apple cart right for those who seek to get rich off of Oklahoma taxpayers.”
Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, authored by Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Josh West, R-Grove, said state law allows the Legislature to remove the Friesen with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. 
The measure passed the Senate by a vote of 43-1.
The House passed it by a vote of 81-5.
“Our job is to come up here and make tough decisions,” West said.
Rosino said the vote was needed to protect people that needed mental health services.
He said the resolution didn’t mean Friesen was dishonest or bad, adding that she was kind and nice. But she was not competent to run the large agency, he said.
“We do not have a choice,” Rosino said. 
He said that he didn’t want the agency’s issues to fester in the interim.
Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, cast the lone Senate vote against the bill, saying Friesen was trying to fix the agency, which opened up a “hornet’s nest.”
“This is not the way to handle business,” he said.
The measure does not require the signature of Stitt, who appointed Friesen to the post in January 2024. 
Friesen has blamed the financial situation on prior administrations, but Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond called for her termination.
“While I cannot begin to understand why Gov. Stitt has chosen to protect Allie Friesen instead of our tax dollars, I applaud the legislative resolution to remove this failed bureaucrat from office,” Drummond said Thursday.
Stitt will now have to appoint a new person to run the mental health agency. Senate confirmation is required.

HB 5004 is a package of climate legislation ranging from a study on heat pumps to transitioning the workforce to green jobs. To see it pass the house this quickly is a victory for advocates and Connecticut residents alike. Still, the bill focused largely on studies instead of direct action. Climate and environmental justice advocates agree, HB 5004 could have been much stronger. 
I’m a 17-year-old climate activist, and for the past three years, I’ve been coming to Hartford and witnessing a frustrating pattern: bold climate legislation repeatedly stalling due to the legislature’s political culture.
The version of HB 5004 last year was significantly weakened with amendments before it passed the House in May 2024. The bill was never brought up for a vote in the Senate. This year, some of the bill’s strongest language was removed before passing the House. The House-passed HB 5004 bill failed to include a Future of Gas docket, which aims to align gas system planning with state climate policy while balancing ratepayer impacts. Legislators also cut out programs for Thermal Energy Networks and active demand response. Thermal Energy Networks are six times more efficient than air source heating, and active demand response would reduce electric demand at times when it is highest – in order to strain the grid less, and reduce energy prices.
Last year’s disappointment and this year’s weakened bill reflect the overall culture in the legislature, a culture which has indefinitely stalled and weakened important bills, preventing any climate action for the past two years.
Despite having a supermajority in both the House and Senate, Democratic leaders insist on bipartisan compromise and a strict tradition of unlimited debate. But this poses an issue: because the legislative session is only three to five months long, there is limited time for bills to be passed. Therefore, leadership usually only brings bills up for a vote after they have been compromised enough, behind closed doors, to easily pass with little debate. This is why legislators don’t move forward with stronger legislation, opting instead for less controversial study-focused bills like HB 5004.
HB 6280, the climate superfund bill introduced this year, is another example of stalled and watered-down legislation. The bill would have held polluting companies accountable by making corporations pay an amount of money proportionate to their share of emissions, and the impact of those emissions on Connecticut. The payments would have gone into a fund used for climate adaptation. The bill didn’t even make it out of committee because legislators assumed it was too progressive to pass.
The environmental rights amendment, SJ 36, is another bill sabotaged by a need to compromise. The bill would have codified the right to clean air, water, soil, environment, and a safe and stable climate into the state constitution. It was meant to be an umbrella of protection, filling in any gaps in existing law. However, the bill was amended to include the modifiers “reasonable” and “unreasonable.” While seemingly harmless, legal experts point out that based on legal precedent, “reasonable” is interpreted as referring to existing law (City of Waterbury v. Town of Washington 260 Conn 506 [2002]). The compromised language defeats the bill’s purpose of filling gaps in existing law and providing overarching protection.
SB 9, the climate resilience bill, also fell victim to compromise. Part of the bill is meant to ban the use of neonicotinoids (toxic insecticides) for many uses. However, the legislators yielded to the chemical industry’s demands. The bill was amended to exempt the use of neonicotinoids on ornamentals from the ban, and to delay the ban one year. There was even talk of adding an amendment that would partially roll back a 2010 ban on pesticide use on K-8 school grounds, which fortunately was rejected.
This is why Connecticut is falling behind not only on climate policy, but any policy that will actually do something real to improve Connecticut for its residents. Compromise and unlimited debate is killing necessary progress-– and Connecticut residents are the ones suffering the costs of high energy bills, climate disasters, and every other issue the legislature has bent to opposition on. 
Who are we really compromising with? The only winners from a lack of climate action are oil and gas companies. “Compromise” ends up being a very slippery slope toward allowing monied interests to infinitely water down the bills that get passed in our state. Our future is being compromised for their profit.
Back to HB 5004. Some of the removed language can be added to SB 4, a priority energy bill, which already includes language on thermal energy networks and demand response. I encourage anyone reading this to ask your legislators to advocate for all of these provisions to be voted on through SB 4.
Though the legislature may insist on compromising our future for polluter profit, we will continue to fight to protect it.

What happens next is up to us.
Last Tuesday, the state Senate unanimously passed SB 1542, a bill that would limit the use of handcuffs and restraints on children. As the legislative session nears its close, what happens next now rests with Connecticut’s House of Representatives and, hopefully soon, Gov. Ned Lamont.
Among northeastern states, Connecticut is uniquely harsh in its treatment of children. We are the only state in the region that allows fourth-graders (kids as young as ten) to be arrested and ushered into the legal system. Law enforcement has wide latitude to handcuff children — even those who have not been charged with a crime. Kids who get arrested can be held in detention before ever seeing a judge, and be bound by mechanical restraints in the courtroom. 
Our organization, The Connecticut Justice Alliance, works directly with young people impacted by the justice system. Our justice advisors provide valuable insight into the faults and failures of the system, and how it should change to better help the kids who encounter it. Many of them testified in support of this bill in front of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee this spring. We also hold conversations with incarcerated youth inside Manson Youth Institution, a children’s prison in Cheshire.  
Those young people reached the same conclusion as years of quantitative data and academic research: to help children change their behavior, they need to be treated like children.  
They say it takes a village to raise a child. We are that village.  
The unfortunate reality is that most offenses by kids stem from failures by adults and a lack of attention to the root causes of their struggles. From instability at home, violence in their communities, a lack of access to essential resources including food and medicine, addiction and mental health struggles, collectively we are failing to provide the support needed to set kids up for success.  
In prioritizing retribution above rehabilitation, we are setting them up for failure while weakening our overarching goals of improving local communities and strengthening public safety.  
The current rules make it more likely that kids interacting with our legal system now will commit criminal offenses as adults. It is self-fulfilling. It is a message to kids that we’ve given up trying to help and no longer view them as worthy of the effort. 
Originally, SB 1542 included a provision to raise the minimum age of arrest. That change was removed during negotiations, but it remains essential to our long-term goal of keeping kids out of the justice system entirely by investing in their education, well-being, and the health of their families and communities. Prevention is an investment in kids’ futures. It is more effective, costs less, and upholds our obligation as adults to make good decisions on behalf of children. When kids are supported early, they’re far less likely to end up in trouble later. 
Passing SB 1542 is an important step in the larger effort to steer kids toward better futures and away from courtrooms and cells. No child is disposable. We need policies that reflect that. 
In our sessions with incarcerated youth, we have noticed that they still think about what’s best for their communities back home. Many are working with us because they want other kids to avoid the mistakes they made and chart a better future for themselves. Kids deserve to see their state government demonstrate that same commitment. 
What happens next is in our hands. We urge lawmakers to pass SB 1542 and take this meaningful step toward a better future for Connecticut’s kids.

For nearly 20 years, the CEP, overseen by the State Elections Enforcement Commission (SEEC), has leveled the playing field, enabling individuals from all backgrounds to run for state office without relying on wealthy donors.
Established in 2005 through bipartisan legislation and first implemented in the 2008 cycle, the CEP provides campaign funds to candidates who raise a significant number of small donations. These funds come with strict spending limits and transparency rules. A national model for public financing, the CEP has successfully removed dark money from state elections, fostering an independent electoral process and encouraging ordinary people to run for office.

State Rep. Lucy Dathan and Sen. Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox
However, the system isn’t perfect. In recent election cycles, campaigns have struggled with the SEEC’s complex policies and procedures. 
While multiple checks are essential to ensure legitimate donations, communication has been a major challenge. Campaigns wait weeks for explanations from SEEC when donations are rejected, despite multiple phone calls and emails asking for information. Protocols were unclear, and there seemed to be no differentiation between a trivial error, such as a donor writing “CT” rather than “Connecticut” on a five-dollar donation check, and a serious violation of election law. 
These problems greatly frustrated campaign treasurers, and the confusion caused by the process made it more difficult to persuade good people to volunteer for campaigns or to run for office themselves, undermining one of the very original purposes of the Citizens’ Election Program.
As co-chairs of the new Government Oversight Committee, we welcomed the opportunity to apply our own professional expertise and commitments to the work of improving transparency and accountability among our own government agencies. 
As Senate Chair, Sujata Gadkar-Wilcox’s background in law and constitutionalism provide a unique legal perspective that is particularly relevant for bills pertaining to government accountability. As House Chair, Lucy Dathan’s background in financial auditing, as a certified public accountant and a chief financial officer brings her vast experience in financial accountability to bills pertaining to public audits and audit processes. 
Our committee worked with other legislators and advocates to craft solutions to the problems brought to our attention. We sought to give SEEC more resources, including by reducing their workload, so that their work can be more effective to carry out their mission. We also worked on Senate Bill 1405. This legislation, which has now passed both Connecticut’s House and Senate and awaits the Governor’s signature, expands public access to SEEC meetings, adds important disclaimers to text messages, and clarifies the materials that campaign treasurers need to retain to assist in compliance with audits. 
The key objective of the bill is to update and improve the efficiency of the Citizens Election Program, while maintaining its independence and oversight of public campaigns. To ensure that changes are not perceived to be partisan, it was also important that the legislation to be supported by all four legislative caucuses.
SB 1405 ensures that updates and guidelines are released sooner, to ensure that candidates have adequate time to plan. Moreover, the bill requires additional clarity and communication over campaign disclosures. Importantly, no updates have been made to SEEC’s determination and review of qualifying grants, so 100% of all contributions will continue to be reviewed for that purpose.
The bill includes reforms to the post-election audit process. As of mid-April 2025, not even a third of audits from the November 2022 election have been finalized (29%) and none of the November 2024 audits have been finalized. This level of delay is unworkable. The agency has been auditing 100% of expenditures for approximately 50% of all campaigns, with each audit undergoing three to four levels of review or re-review by various staff. 
While there is no doubt that ensuring that public funds are spent carefully is essential, this level of scrutiny is excessive and inefficient. There are no auditing standards anywhere that require this level of scrutiny, and with this level of work done to get a clean audit opinion. This underscores why the audit parameters must change.
SB 1405 includes important changes that will strengthen the CEP and assist campaigns and treasurers in understanding what they need to do to comply. The legislation passed the Connecticut Senate on a vote of 34 to 1. Critics in the Connecticut House, where the bill also passed on a 92 to 46 vote, maintain that watchdog agencies such as SEEC should remain independent and that this legislation subordinates SEEC to the legislature. 
But the bill does not do so. It does not allow the legislature to approve or disapprove any regulations passed by SEEC whatsoever. The only aspect of this bill that has become a central point of contention when it comes to agency independence is the provision that requires a SEEC Executive Director seeking reappointment after a four-year term to receive confirmation by the legislature. The legislation does not change SEEC’s right to appoint its Executive Director in the first place. The legislature is the voice of the people; its function is to provide public oversight.
There are other areas too where agency independence is critical to the functioning of agency power, and where there is nevertheless minimal oversight by the legislature. For example, the judicial branch must be independent of the legislature, but the legislature still confirms judges, including the chief justice. To require some confirmation process of unelected public employees by legislators who are accountable to the people is also a part of our democratic process. The key is for that oversight to be limited to a minimal check on the agency and not become a kind of legislative overreach on its decision-making.
Over the course of the last several months, we have all witnessed the destruction wrought by an unaccountable watchdog agency whose leadership is not confirmed by the legislature. That description perfectly fits the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk. While we are not comparing SEEC, which is replete with excellent public officials, to DOGE, we are suggesting that the claim that DOGE should be entirely isolated from the legislature as a watchdog agency should give us pause, and raises an important question for all of us: what are the potential consequences of other watchdog agencies that seek an exemption from any legislative oversight? This is why we must balance the independence of watchdog agencies with the need for such agencies to also be transparent and accountable to the public.
Senate Bill 1405 attempts to strike this delicate balance. It allows SEEC to remain independent and therefore shields its regulations from scrutiny by the legislature. While earlier drafts contained some language that seemed to infringe more on separation of powers, that language was appropriately removed, and the final bill does not cross that line. 
It requires SEEC operations to be more transparent, and its procedures to be clearly defined to campaigns. It also requires some oversight of a SEEC Executive Director by a legislature that is accountable to the public. That is already the process in place for the remaining commissioners of SEEC, and the bill does not include any legislative approval of agency regulations and guidelines. Those agency protocols, which are entirely initiated by the agency, and must be transparent and universal, serve as the basis of SEEC’s regulatory decisions when it comes to each individual candidate. That further isolates SEEC from any legislative overreach into agency decision-making.
This legislation is a win for Connecticut, encouraging public financing, clarifying audit procedures, and allowing SEEC to operate more efficiently. We’ve already received positive feedback from campaign treasurers, and we remain committed to supporting the Citizens Election Program and SEEC and advocating for transparent, accountable, and ethical government in Connecticut.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 03:44:36+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT House unanimously passes bill boosting support, oversight for special education",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/ct-special-education-funding-oversight/,Bill increases regulation of private special education providers while adding funds for districts to develop their own in-house programs.,"The House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill Thursday increasing regulation and oversight of private special education providers while also providing funds to encourage districts to develop their own in-house programs. 
The bill, which sought to address steeply rising costs of special education, includes $30 million each year for 2026 and 2027 for a new “special education expansion grant” for school districts based on the amount they receive through the state’s Education Cost Sharing formula. The $30 million for 2026 will be added to $221 million already in the budget for special education that year. 
The grant may be used either for expanding a district’s on-site special education services, or expanding “tier two” interventions in math and reading — academic or behavioral help that is offered in advance to special education. 
“We can all say that we have seen a large number of students that have gone through our school systems, that are not able to receive the supports that they need,” said Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor, co-chair of the legislature’s Select Committee on Special Education. “Addressing this gap especially of providing special education dollars for districts to increase their capacity for serving students with special needs — it was essential in this legislation.” 
Khan introduced the legislation, H.B. 5001, on the House floor and spoke at length in its favor Thursday evening before representatives voted unanimously to support it. The bill will now go to the Senate for a vote.
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, said she believed investing in these “tier two” supports would ultimately lower districts’ special education costs, because fewer children would need special education services.
“If we can catch kids from the Pre-K through 3, we can kind of stop that train. We can give them the help that they need when they’re younger,” said Nuccio. 
Many school districts pay private providers to educate students with special needs. Khan said the additional state funding should make it possible for districts to offer more of that support directly. “We want districts to be able to expand their services in-house and provide what they can in their school buildings as much as possible,” Rep. Maryam Khan, D-Windsor, said during a press conference on Thursday. 
The bill also raises the age by which a child can be diagnosed with a developmental delay from age 5 to age 8. Khan said developmental delays often go undiagnosed before the age of five, meaning many children go without needed services.
A large part of the bill seeks to expand regulation of private special education providers. It requires the State Department of Education to set a rate schedule — to be reviewed every two years — limiting how much providers can charge for services, including speech, behavioral and occupational therapies. It also prohibits private special education institutions from raising rates in the middle of the school year. 
Rep. Tina Courpas, R-Greenwich, said Republicans were in support of the rate setting for private providers, but said it was a “complicated thing” that they wanted to make sure was correct. “ We also want to get it right so that we don’t drive any provider to special ed services out of Connecticut’s market. We want it to be a robust market,” she said. 
Rep. Amy Romano, R-Shelton, said she was conflicted about the idea of rate setting. While she agreed that the high cost of special education needed to be addressed, she was worried that private programs might respond by increasing class sizes, and that it could mean a loss of teachers and providers. 
Khan said the State Department of Education was already regulating rates for four residential programs in Connecticut. “ They’ve done it for many years and we’ve never had any concerns from those four programs, and they’ve done that effectively and those programs have thrived,” she said. 
Khan also said that other states like New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts set rates for private providers. And she said the state legislature would have final approval over the rates that would be set. 
The bill also calls for the State Department of Education to conduct random surprise visits at private special education institutions. If the department identifies problems, the school would have 30 days to correct the problems or be subject to a fine. It also requires school districts to written contracts with providers, and it adds reporting requirements for the private providers. 
Rep. Lezlye Zupkus, R-Prospect, said she was concerned about the State Department of Education’s ability to conduct the audits, since the state has 113 approved special education programs. 
Khan said the bill included $5 million to assist the department by providing several additional staff members as recommended by the State Department of Education. 
The department declined to comment for this story.
Growing needs
Andy Feinstein, a special education attorney and a co-chair of the state’s Task Force to Study Special Education Services and Funding, said earlier this year that the cost of special education outplacements to private providers had “skyrocketed.” From 2023 to 2024, excess costs for special education rose 25%, and they’re estimated to have risen an additional 11% in 2025. 
The number of children in special education has also increased. In 2025, more than 18% of students across the state have special education needs. 
“We have a situation where the costs are going up and we want to and need to fulfill these children’s needs, and yet the burdens that are being put on the school districts to fund those is becoming untenable,” Courpas told lawmakers on Thursday. 
In March, the legislature voted to send $40 million in emergency funding to the local school districts for the current school year. 
Governor Ned Lamont had proposed $40 million in special education funding for districts in 2027, and the legislature’s budget committee added $40 million in 2026 as well. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, told reporters on Thursday that the bill, while “not transformative” was “ moving the ball down the field in the right direction.” 
Under the legislation, a commission already tasked with studying education funding would take up several additional topics, including studying whether the state has enough programs to meet current demand, how lower-level interventions are being used in school districts, the possibility of a “peer review” allowing districts to model one another’s programs and respite care. 
It is also charged with offering recommendations on the best way to measure whether the special education programs in districts were meeting performance standards. 
Courpas said Republicans were particularly proud of the measurements around student performance that they’d placed in the bill. 
“ To us, the most important question is, are we serving the kids of Connecticut? Are we doing well by them? Are we providing effective special ed services?” she said. 
And the bill also prescribes an analysis into the workload of special education workers in the state — a response, Khan said, to reports she’d heard about teachers facing increased paperwork and high rates of burnout. She noted that half of special education teachers left the education field within five years. 
“We felt that it would properly address the workload that is put on special education staff so that we can retain our staff,” said Khan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0529_SR_Session_167-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-30 00:00:59.742356

Nancy Mace starts her speech on the House floor Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. (Screenshot from C-Span)A woman says in a civil lawsuit filed Thursday that she was a victim of three of the men that U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace accused in a stunning speech on the U.S. House floor of being sexual predators.
The lawsuit says the woman, identified as Jane Doe, was sexually assaulted by one of the men in a Sullivan’s Island home while she was unconscious as the other two filmed it and took photos. She suspects she was drugged.
The woman says she is the victim Mace referenced during her nearly hour-long floor speech in February, when she said, “I had to tell a woman she’d been raped.” Until Mace contacted her in April 2024, she had no idea what happened that night in October 2018, according to the lawsuit.
Video of the assault was among the thousands of images Mace said she found on her then-fiancé’s cellphone in November 2023 before breaking up with him, according to the lawsuit.
Mace says she turned all of it over to the State Law Enforcement Division, which confirmed in February that it opened an investigation in December 2023 after receiving a call from U.S. Capitol Police.
During a news conference Thursday at her congressional office on Daniel Island, Mace read from the lawsuit and applauded the woman’s “strength in coming forward.”
“I told her the truth. It was one of the hardest conversations of my life,” Mace told reporters about notifying her of what she found. “I will stand with her under oath every step of the way.”
No criminal charges have been filed against any of the men for the accusations laid out in graphic detail in the lawsuit. It seeks unspecified damages for claims that include battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, negligence and conspiracy.
Asked why she believed there hadn’t been any charges filed yet, Marybeth Mullaney, the woman’s attorney, said she couldn’t answer for SLED.
A SLED spokeswoman said Thursday the investigation continues.
The lawsuit says an anonymous witness, identified as Jane Doe Witness, saw the crime happening from security cameras in the home but was too scared to do anything. The security camera footage was deleted the next day, but the witness says she’d written about it that night in an online diary entry she emailed to herself.
Mace said she found the video on her fiancé’s phone five years later after the two went to couple’s counseling with two pastors, who suggested he needed to give Mace access to his phone “to build trust.” And he did.
According to the lawsuit, Mace went to the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in December 2023, and they asked SLED to investigate. A month later, Mace contacted the unnamed witness, thinking it might be her in the video. It wasn’t, but the witness said she remembered what happened.
The lawsuit names Patrick Bryant (Mace’s ex-fiancé), Eric Bowman, and John Osborne, all residents of Charleston County and longtime friends and business associates. Not mentioned in the suit is a fourth man Mace named from the House floor, another friend of Bryant’s who has since sued her in federal court for defamation. All four have vehemently and repeatedly denied Mace’s allegations since February.
Bowman and Bryant immediately denied the additional claims in the lawsuit, labeling it the latest in Mace’s political drama.
“This lawsuit is nothing more than a political stunt,” said Bowman, adding that his estranged wife and Mace have a “coordinated vendetta against him.”
“Their agenda is personal, not principled and the allegations are 100% false,” he said.
Osborne declined to comment and directed questions to his attorney, Ryan Schwartz, who pointed the SC Daily Gazette to a deposition obtained by news outlets last week. Schwartz called it “very telling.”
In an April 28 deposition given under subpoena, campaign consultant Wesley Donehue said Mace asked him in late 2023 to meet with Bryant and use the information she found as leverage to get full ownership in two homes the former couple owned together: one on the Isle of Palms and another in Washington, D.C., but Donehue refused, according to The Post and Courier and other outlets.
“She said, ‘I’m going to use this information to get my houses,” Donehue said, adding he told her to go to authorities.
In a statement to the Gazette, Mace downplayed the alleged blackmail attempt as “deposition clickbait.”
The lawsuit also accuses Bowman and Bryant of trying to “intimidate, shame, and embarrass” the Jane Doe into not filing the lawsuit.
Bryant called it Mace’s latest stunt in a long-running blackmail campaign against him.
“It is simply part of a narrative and continuing effort on her part designed to attempt to destroy me, and to somehow benefit politically from the publicity,” he said.
In a statement provided by Mullaney, Jane Doe said she filed the lawsuit “for myself and for other women who fear being publicly shamed if they report what happened to them.”
She went on to note that she and Mace, who is mulling a run for governor next year, “do not share the same political ideology,” saying what’s “important to me is her courage in bringing this to light.”
According to the lawsuit, Mace told her the anti-voyeurism bill she’s working to pass in Congress, which would strengthen penalties for people who record explicit images without consent, would “prevent what happened to her from happening to other women.” The lawsuit also says that bill is why Mace made the speech on the House floor in February.
More lawsuits are likely forthcoming.
The deposition reported about last week was conducted by Barrett Brewer, a lawyer of Bryant’s.
Responding to the deposition, Mace’s office pointed to other parts of Donehue’s statement.
“He said she came to him emotionally distraught and feared for her safety. He saw bruises on her body,” a spokesperson said. “Nothing else matters.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-22-e1740752098272-1024x665.png,,,2025-05-29 22:58:51.731075

Jahana Hayes said she has a new sense of urgency to speak out forcefully on issues she cares about, like nutrition and education.","Now a member of Congress in the second Trump era, Jahana Hayes has a new sense of urgency.
Appearing Thursday night at The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” series hosted by John Dankosky at the C.H. Booth Library in Newtown, Hayes said she is speaking out more forcefully on the issues she cares about since she was first elected to represent Connecticut’s 5th District in Congress six years ago.
She reflected on her evolution as an elected official after four elections and her reasoning for becoming more “outspoken” when President Donald J. Trump returned to the White House.
Hayes was new to the world of politics when she first ran for Congress in 2018. She was a teacher in her home town of Waterbury and won National Teacher of the Year two years earlier.
She said she joined the ranks of Congress with a “little bit of an imposter syndrome,” conceding that she didn’t expect to win “because it was such a Herculean task.”
But on Thursday, she asserted confidence in her job as a legislator and the perspective she brings because of her lived experiences. She purposely joined the House committees that oversee education and agriculture because of her job as a teacher where she taught kids whose only meals would be served at school.
Now, Hayes said, some issues are red lines for her, with nutrition and education at the top of the list.
“Even in an effort to be bipartisan, I have some hard lines. I’m not going to work with you if you don’t want to feed kids,” Hayes said. “I think today, in this environment that we’re in, I’m going down swinging on all the issues that I care about.”
“There was a time where I thought if we can get this, then we live to fight another day, and we work,” Hayes said. “But now everything seems urgent, like everything seems like this is the last change to get it right. So I think that I am a lot more outspoken on issues today in this term than I was before.”
The hour-long conversation delved into some of the issues she’s most familiar with, both because of her work on two committees and her personal experiences: the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education and Republicans’ tax bill that would cut spending for nutrition assistance.
Education Secretary Linda McMahon, who lives in Greenwich, has been overseeing the overhaul of her department that Trump has promised to disband. Her promise to shift education back to the states and change some of the federal agency’s oversight and responsibilities could leave states like Connecticut to fill in the gaps.
Hayes believes many people have misconceptions about what the federal agency does, noting that it does not set curriculum and instead oversees things like student loans, Pell Grants and civil rights. She argued that there needs to be a “long-term investment strategy” in the public education. And she fears what will happen to special education if it is moved out of the jurisdiction of the education department.
And as Republicans have inched closer to passing their tax bill, Hayes was recently front and center as the House Agriculture Committee debated Trump’s “big beautiful bill” and the cuts that would be made to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. Hayes serves as the ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture.
The proposed changes to SNAP would for the first time require states to pay for a portion of nutrition benefits for low-income individuals and families. That cost-sharing plan and new work requirements are raising concerns about whether states like Connecticut would need to cut benefits or change eligibility.
The GOP plan would impose stronger work requirements for certain able-bodied adults without dependents, raising the age limit from 54 to 64. The same would also apply to adults with children age 7 or older. They would be required to work or participate in related training for at least 80 hours a month.
“Hunger is a policy choice,” Hayes said. “I did not come to Congress to starve kids. You don’t get to say we saved $4 billion but we just throw 7 million kids off of a food safety net program. People don’t understand how dogged I am about food and nutrition.”
Over the past six years, Hayes said, she has learned more about how Congress works as well as the relationships between lawmakers. She noted that, in private, she felt like she could have conversations with colleagues and make progress on an issue. But that would change when she learned how they voted moments later.
“Your vote tells me where you stand on an issue. I don’t want to hear empty words. I don’t want to hear promises,” Hayes said. “You can’t tell me you care about something and then go in and vote about it and vote differently.”
That led to a question about why she said she regrets her vote in support of the Laken Riley Act, which requires the detention of unauthorized migrants who have been arrested or charged with burglary, theft, shoplifting, or causing serious injury. It was signed into law by Trump about a week after he took office in late January.
Hayes was one of a 46 House Democrats who joined Republicans in passing the bill. The congresswoman and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, were the only members of Connecticut’s delegation to vote for the legislation.
She said she was reflecting on the 2024 elections and the message from voters on immigration as a top issue. For Hayes, the provision about detaining someone over assaulting a law enforcement officer stuck out. Her husband, Milford Hayes, is a retired police officer.
Looking back, she said she was wary of other parts of the bill, including concerns about a lack of due process. But she ultimately voted for it.
When she said she regretted it at a recent televised CNN town hall, Hayes said she was cautioned not to make public comments like that, especially as a woman. But on Thursday, she pushed back at that sentiment and said she believes that is part of an elected official’s job.
“What I’ve seen is that just bastardizing those little things like literally erasing due process to the point where our people are being shipped to foreign prisons, and this idea that every person who immigrates to this country for whatever reason is a criminal or a rapist or a murderer,” Hayes said.
“[Republicans’] intent was not to pursue an immigration strategy,” she said. “That provision was not worth the tradeoff of what I’m seeing now.”
When asked about Trump’s pardon of former Gov. John Rowland, Hayes argued that it “flies in the face of the party of law and order,” while noting Rowland’s “isn’t even the most egregious of the pardons.”
Rowland, a Waterbury native, represented the 5th District from 1985 to 1991 and went on to serve as governor. During his third term, he faced impeachment and a federal investigation that led to his resignation in 2004. He pleaded guilty to corruption charges and served less than a year in prison. He was convicted again about a decade later and sentenced to more time in prison.
Hayes said she believes in second chances but criticized Trump’s overall strategy of pardoning people who she believes haven’t taken accountability for their actions or those who sought clemency by attending fundraising dinners.
“We’re talking about just using the power of the presidency and the pardon power for political favor,” she said.
But she acknowledged the positive feelings toward the former governor that still exist in her hometown.
“I’m from Waterbury. There are people in Waterbury who still love John Rowland,” Hayes said. “I get it. But you did a bad thing.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/dankoskyhayesintheroom-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-29 22:05:17.810975

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Colton George felt sick. The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown (D-Ohio). “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
The High Cost of Foodborne Illnesses
Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas. “This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Salmonella bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. A 2008-09 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter killed nine, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
‘Life or Death for Our Son’
E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

In the spirit of “collaboration” rather than preemption — a dynamic that for several years now has undergirded policy discussions over what should be done to address Utah’s affordable housing crisis — Gov. Spencer Cox invited mayors from across the state to the Governor’s Mansion in Salt Lake City on Thursday to talk. 
Utah has more than 250 cities and towns, but mayors from about 40 cities came to the governor’s “Built Here Housing Summit” to trade ideas in a closed-door meeting. In a news conference held outside the governor’s mansion immediately after, Cox said they came together to work toward a “shared goal” that he described as “very simple, but urgent.” 
Utah governor doubles down on goal to build 35K homes in 5 years 

“How can we work together — state and local — to make housing more attainable for Utah families?” Cox said. 
At the end of 2023, Cox set an ambitious “moonshot” goal for the state and its home builders: build 35,000 new starter homes by 2028. Since then, Cox said 5,100 have been built or are in process across the state. 
“We know that’s not enough,” Cox said. “We’re on our way, but we desperately need to do more. With Utah’s growing population, we need to do more, and we need to move faster.” 
The biggest challenge facing city and state officials when it comes to housing policy? Cox said it’s the constant “tension” between state and local government when it comes to local control over zoning and land use and whether state leaders should use preemption powers to force local governments to allow more housing types. 
Though some lawmakers have wanted the state to take more aggressive actions, in recent years the Utah Legislature has taken a gentler, “collaborative approach,” focusing on providing a variety of planning tools to incentivize cities and developers to build more owner-occupied “starter homes.” 
Meanwhile, other states including Colorado, California and Massachusetts have passed housing policy changes that have prompted lawsuits from cities resisting state mandates. The Utah Legislature hasn’t flexed that muscle — at least not yet. Time will tell whether the toolbox the Utah Legislature has so far built to incentivize housing development will make a difference. 
But to gain momentum, Cox said state leaders must work with — not against — mayors and other city leaders to find solutions for affordable housing.

“The American dream of home ownership is slowly but surely slipping away from far too many, out of reach of our children and grandchildren,” he said. “Reversing that trend requires collaboration, requires courage, and action from all levels of government.” 
About a dozen mayors who attended Cox’s summit also joined Thursday’s news conference, including Clearfield Mayor Mark Shepherd, Herriman Mayor Lorin Palmer and Spanish Fork Mayor Mike Mendenhall — all from cities that have utilized some of the zoning tools, like transit-oriented development, to build housing projects. 
Cox didn’t name names, but he said there are still some “bad actors” or a “few cities here and there that aren’t approving plans, that are taking years to get things done, that are very purposely driving up costs to make it so development can’t happen.” 
Utah’s new housing experiment

“And yet,” the governor added, “we have dozens and dozens and dozens of cities who are doing this the right way.” He said “we want to learn from each other,” but across 250 jurisdictions, “oftentimes we don’t share the wins, the things that are happening.” 
“So,” Cox said, “here’s what’s next.” 
He announced that the state is launching a “statewide housing dashboard so that everyone from residents to city planners can track progress, identify gaps and learn from their successes.” 
“We’re committed to ensuring Utah doesn’t fall behind on housing reform,” Cox said.
The dashboard, circulated later Thursday afternoon by the governor’s office, includes a heat map of where deed restricted units, deeply affordable units, and other forms of more affordable housing have been built. It also includes data on where the 5,100 “starter homes” have so far been planned or built. Most – 2,489 — are in Utah County. Salt Lake County has 706, and Tooele County has 432, according to the dashboard. 
As of Thursday, however, the site was still a work in progress, with some pages saying “data under development.” 
Cox: There are ‘broken incentive structures’ worsening Utah’s housing crisis

Steve Waldrip, Cox’s senior housing adviser, told reporters that the dashboard is being built using data from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute, as well as data from a variety of real estate sources. 
If everyone can see what communities are making progress on providing housing options — and which cities aren’t — Waldrip said the dashboard may act as a “carrot-shaped stick” to push cities to do more for housing. 
“You can take it either way,” he said. “It will highlight those who are succeeding. And that’s not a bad thing.” 
Cox — who once served as mayor of his rural hometown of Fairview — said he knows local officials face challenges when it comes to housing. “I have a tremendous amount of empathy for what they’re going through,” he said, adding that he knows some have opted not to run for office again because of controversy over higher density housing projects. 
“They’ll do the right thing and improve a development that will benefit future generations, and then there’s a referendum, and the project gets denied,” Cox said. “They get voted out of office, because a small, very vocal group of neighbors … can (get) very angry about any type of new housing going in.” 
So Cox said he “appreciated” their willingness to engage with state leaders to be part of the solution. 
The mayors who spoke during Thursday’s news conference framed Utah’s housing issue as a personal one that threatens quality of life for their kids and grandkids.

Clearfield Mayor Mark Shepherd said all but one of his seven kids have homes of their own because they bought during the time when they could.” But he said he has one daughter he can’t afford to buy amid today’s higher housing prices, and “the ironic thing is, she’s married to a developer.”
“She’s married to a home builder, and can’t afford to build a house,” Shepherd said. “The cost of everything has skyrocketed. We need a place to put our kids. We need a place to put those who want to come to the state, and that’s every level of housing.”

Though 40 mayors engaged with the governor on Thursday, Waldrip acknowledged there are still others that remain resistant to allowing more housing. 
“I would definitely say no, not all mayors are on board with it. Some mayors have been elected in different cities on a platform of no growth. Mayors have been kicked out of office because they approved growth,” Waldrip said. “So those mayors feel an obligation to stick to their campaign promise.” 
However, Waldrip said he’s also talked to some of those mayors who now have changed their tune, realizing it’s a “real problem” and the lack of housing is leading some to give up on the American dream. 
To Spanish Fork Mayor Mike Mendenhall, Utah’s housing problem shouldn’t be political — and it can be fixed if leaders focus on the need for solutions rather than the barriers. 
“If we can find a way for this problem not to be political, but be practical,” Mendenhall said, “I’m confident that we can solve these problems for home ownership in our state.”

Lawmakers are debating whether to criminalize the sale and purchase of unlicensed marijuana. (Photo by Amanda Brown for the New Jersey Monitor)Lawmakers mulled Thursday whether New Jersey should ramp up enforcement against unlicensed cannabis sellers by passing a bill that would criminalize the purchase of unlicensed marijuana.
The bill riled cannabis activists who say it would bring back the criminalization of weed that New Jersey’s marijuana legalization law was supposed to end. 
Under the bill, sponsored by Senate President Nick Scutari (D-Union), it would be a third-degree crime to operate an unlicensed marijuana business and a disorderly persons offense to knowingly purchase from one. A person who leads an “illegal marijuana business network” would be charged with a second-degree crime. 
“We have a problem where people are opening up brick-and-mortar stores, small stores, unlicensed to sell these products, and quite frankly, they’re just selling them and this state is doing nothing about it,” Scutari told the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday. “We need to do something more about those brick-and-mortar stores, but we also need to continue to fight back against drug dealers because those are alive and well.” 
Scutari spearheaded legalizing recreational cannabis, first introducing legislation to regulate it for adult use in 2014. After bills languished in the Legislature, recreational cannabis was legalized in 2020 by voters, and Scutari was the primary sponsor of the bill to launch the legal marijuana industry.
Scutari said the new legislation would be a corrective measure in response to the “black and gray market” that has flourished even though hundreds of cannabis dispensaries have opened statewide.










Recriminalization is not regulation. It’s retaliation.


– Larry Grant, board member of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana


New Jersey has some of the most expensive cannabis in the nation for both medical and recreational users. The industry has raked in over $1 billion since sales launched in April 2022. 
The committee did not vote on the bill, which does not yet have a companion in the Assembly.
Lawmakers generally voiced support for Scutari’s proposal to address the unlicensed THC products that they say undermine the regulated industry. Sen. Joe Lagana (D-Bergen) said he’s seen questionable cannabis products in “every single gas station I walk into, every convenience store, every corner store.”
But senators also repeatedly placed blame on the Attorney General’s Office, accusing it of not enforcing the state’s cannabis laws.
Sen. Mike Testa blasted Attorney General Matt Platkin for what he called “absentee” leadership. And Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) said that once certain laws aren’t enforced, the community “loses respect for government.” Bramnick suggested the committee should call on Platkin to appear before them on the issue and said ignoring the law is “disrespectful to this body.”
A spokesperson for Platkin did not respond to requests for comment. 
Cannabis advocates who helped usher in the recreational market criticized Scutari’s bill as a dangerous reversal. One of them, attorney Bill Caruso, told committee members they need to speak to local mayors and law enforcement about the tools they need to fight against unlicensed cannabis sales.
“We don’t need to reinvent the wheel here, and I don’t think we need to go backwards in recriminalizing particularly consumers,” he said. 
He also agreed that the attorney general “needs to explain to the elected officials of this body” why laws aren’t being enforced. 
Larry Grant is a cancer survivor who takes cannabis for chronic pain and is a board member of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana. Grant called the bill “deeply unethical” and “the opposite” of what legalization set out to achieve. 
“People with cancer or chronic pain disability could be arrested simply for accessing a plant that helps them survive,” he said. “Recriminalization is not regulation. It’s retaliation.” 
Scutari said he’s open to changes to the bill, but establishing the crimes of selling and, in some cases, purchasing unlicensed marijuana “is necessary in order to drive people to a place where they can buy it legally.” 
“We would not accept the corner store that didn’t have a liquor license to sell liquor. We should not accept the corner store selling cannabis product without a license, nor should we accept people selling it out of their garage,” he said. “We have a legal marketplace now, and there are good reasons for it because it is safe for people to ingest that product.”

Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Westerly Democrat, rises to defend his bill that would regulate the psychoactive compound kratom during the Rhode Island House of Representatives' floor session on Thursday, May 29, 2025. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)For the second year in a row, the Rhode Island House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize and regulate the sale and manufacture of kratom, the psychoactive drug derived from a plant native to Southeast Asia. 
The bill’s sponsor, Speaker Pro Tempore Brian Patrick Kennedy of Westerly, returned to the House chamber just in time to see the legislation succeed by a 40-23 vote. Kennedy has been absent from the House floor since April 22 for medical reasons, chamber spokesperson Larry Berman confirmed in a Thursday evening email.  
Kennedy’s successful bill, H5565A, would remove Rhode Island from a list of six states that ban outright the sale and manufacture of kratom. The plant contains dozens of psychoactive alkaloids — the chemicals responsible for an array of effects including stimulation, euphoria and sedation. Due to its interaction with the brain’s opioid receptors, some people who use kratom are recovering from or trying to quit opioids. The alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are largely responsible for kratom’s dose-dependent effects and are the substances most frequently targeted by legislation.
Most states do not regulate kratom, but some have started to adopt legislation backed by the kratom industry and advocacy groups nationwide. Fourteen state legislatures have passed kratom “consumer protection” bills as of March 2025, according to KFF Health News. Like those bills, Kennedy’s legislation — and its companion S0792 in the Senate sponsored by Sen. Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat — puts in place the regulatory framework for the drug’s sale and distribution with the intent of reining in gray market sales in places like head shops and gas stations. 
The measure passed last year in both the House and Senate during the waning hours of the legislative session in mid-June. But Gov. Dan McKee vetoed the legislation when it arrived on his desk a few weeks later, citing regulatory confusion and the advice of state health officials. It’s unclear if McKee will nix the bill again this year. 
This year’s bill is called the Rhode Island Kratom Act, and adds a new licensing and tax mechanism in coordination with the Department of Revenue, which was absent in last year’s iteration.
“We’re looking for new sources of revenue for the state of Rhode Island,” Kennedy said on the House floor. “This actually will provide us with a new source of revenue.”
“The Kratom legislation pending in the General Assembly is different than last year’s bill, so the Governor will carefully review the final bill that reaches his desk, if and when it does,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee, said via email Thursday.
Meanwhile, in the Senate, Gallo’s bill was heard in committee on April 8 but has yet to be scheduled for a committee vote. 
‘Sends a conflicting message’
Among the 23 dissenting votes in the House were Republicans and progressive and moderate Democrats alike. Four representatives rose in opposition to the bill, with Rep. Michelle McGaw, a Portsmouth Democrat, reprising arguments she voiced during the bill’s floor vote last year.
“I don’t think it comes as a surprise to anyone in this chamber that I have concerns about kratom being available on our streets, in local convenience stores, in gas stations,” McGaw told her colleagues. 
Rep. Chris Paplauskas, a Cranston Republican, said legalizing kratom could strain the state’s health care system even further — not to mention conflict with legislation the House passed in April.
“This body also recently voted in favor of harm reduction sites as a way to combat opioid addiction,” Paplauskas said. “Expanding access to kratom, a substance that acts like an opioid, undermines those efforts and sends a conflicting message.”
Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican, offered a cautionary blast from the past.
“For those of you in the room who are as old as me, you might remember a little drug called ma huang, which was really popular in the ’90s,” Hopkins said. “We put it in all our energy drinks. You could buy it in any gas station.”
Ma huang is another name for ephedra, which is similar to kratom in that it contains multiple psychoactive alkaloids — including ephedrine, which is synthesized for over-the-counter decongestants like Sudafed and Primatene. Ephedrine, which is considered a regulatable drug and not a supplement, remains available in pharmacies under strict controls. 
But parent compound ephedra was as ubiquitous as Hopkins described, sold on its own or mixed into weight loss and energy supplements. A number of deaths, including 30 in a five-year period among otherwise healthy military personnel, led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban ephedra in 2004.  
“We don’t need a repeat of that, and passing this bill will be a repeat of that,” Hopkins said.
Kennedy defended his bill. It’s much longer compared to the previous effort, at 25 pages — a length at which industry advocates bristled during committee hearings in April, fearing Kennedy’s redux departed too far from industry goals. It also incorporates input from the Rhode Island Department of Health and the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.
He reiterated his belief in the drug’s safety: “The FDA dose-finding study concluded kratom is safe at all dose levels, and they really put a lot of kratom into people for that to be determined.”
The dose-finding study in 2024, however, did not convince the FDA to change its stance on the drug. The agency’s website, updated in August, still reads: “There are no drug products containing kratom or its two main chemical components that are legally on the market in the U.S. FDA has not approved any prescription or over-the-counter drug products containing kratom or its two main chemical components, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.”
Independent Rep. Jon Brien of Woonsocket pointed out a contradiction between the chamber’s decisions when it comes to drug use. He offered the example of the flavored vape ban that passed as part of last year’s budget.
“We shut down actual existing businesses in the state of Rhode Island because they were selling grape-flavored, banana-flavored, frutti-tutti-flavored vapes. But we did that because we said, ‘The children, we got to save the children.’”
Brien said he felt “terrible” about opposing Kennedy’s measure on his first day back, but he pushed forward.
“What message are we sending?” Brien asked. “We just constantly send these inconsistent messages from this room. You can’t vape tutti-frutti, but you could buy some kratom at the gas station and get out in your car and take it right away.”

,DC,2025-05-30 01:05:02+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal court wrestles with status of Venezuelans with work permits but denied TPS,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-court-wrestles-status-venezuelans-work-permits-denied-tps,,"A federal judge in California said Thursday he is considering issuing an order to preserve work permits for a small group of Venezuelans with temporary protected status, which allows migrants to live in the United States for a set period without fear of deportation.They were granted these extended protections by immigration officials before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that allowed the Trump administration to revoke those protections.A hearing before U.S. District Judge Edward Chen was the first in the case since the Supreme Court on May 19 allowed the Trump administration to end temporary protections for a group of 350,000 Venezuelans and vacated Chen’s order blocking the administration’s move.Chen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama to a seat in the Northern District of California, acknowledged that the Supreme Court’s decision has left an “island” of about 5,000 Venezuelans who have gotten work permits approved until October of 2026 — before the high court’s order moved up the date their TPS status expired.“It's a small exception,” he said.Attorneys for those TPS holders filed an emergency motion to protect that subgroup to keep those work and deportation protections through October 2026. They are also pushing for an expedited hearing schedule to challenge the administration’s revocation of protections because the group of Venezuelans lost protections in April, meaning they are subject to deportation.“Every day that there's not a final decision in this case, our plaintiffs are now subject to deportation, are now losing their jobs, and we need to move urgently towards a final resolution in this case,” Jessica Karp Bansal, who is representing the National TPS Alliance, said at a Thursday hearing.Back and forthIn March, Chen found that Homeland Security Secretary Krisiti Noem’s decision to revoke extended protections for Venezuelans previously granted under the Biden administration until October of 2026 was arbitrary and capricious.

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-30 00:38:26+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lawmakers approve $7 billion budget in special session marred by political fighting,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/29/lawmakers-approve-7-billion-budget-in-special-session-marred-by-political-fighting/,"The Legislature failed to pass a budget during its regular session this year, prompting the governor to order them back to Jackson.","Lawmakers on Thursday finally passed a $7.1 billion state budget to fund government agencies, but it wasn’t a master class in legislative statesmanship. 
Senators complained about their House counterparts, House members fought bitterly among themselves about budget details and lawmakers knowingly passed a bill that conflicts with federal Medicaid regulations. 
The public display of bickering took place during a special legislative session because lawmakers couldn’t agree on a budget during their regular session earlier this year, which was also mired in Republican infighting. Gov. Tate Reeves called them back to Jackson this week to pass a budget before the new fiscal year begins July 1. 
“Yes — this should have been completed in regular session,” Reeves wrote on social media. “But once clear that was no longer an option, the two sides worked diligently to find an agreement that met my specific criteria and passed it while minimizing costs of a Special Session.” 
The Senate wrapped up its work Thursday evening, after debating whether it should approve the state Department of Health’s budget, after senators discovered it contained a provision that could jeopardize $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid money for Mississippi. 
The 52-member chamber approved the budget and said they had a guarantee that Reeves would veto the provision out of the agency’s budget. 
Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann thanked the senators for their work, but he accused House leaders of working in bad faith by renegging on some prior budget agreements and by filing bills that were outside Reeves’ parameters for the special session. 
“There were three more significant bills that came from the House, which were not on the governor’s call and did not reflect the agreement of the House, the governor and the Senate,” Hosemann said.  
Senate Democrats opposed almost all of the budget bills in the special session because they complained they did not receive any advance drafts of the bills ahead of the session. 
Hosemann told Mississippi Today that he shared a budget summary with all senators on Sunday and encouraged them to ask questions about the budget to Senate leaders ahead of the special session. 
Senate Minority Leader Derrick Simmons, a Democrat from Greenville, attempted to replace agency funds frozen by the federal government with state funds, but Republican senators used procedural tactics to defeat the measures. 
The House finished its work on the budget in the early hours of Thursday morning after working all Wednesday night to approve, debate, and question the spending bills. 
House leaders struck a more conciliatory tone with Democratic members late Wednesday, after the two factions, earlier in the day, butted heads over the budget process and House Speaker Jason White threatening to remove a member from the chamber. 
Like their Senate colleagues, House Democrats grew frustrated that they were largely kept in the dark about the specifics of the budget and used a constitutional provision to force the reading aloud of lengthy budget bills. 
Irate at the filibuster tactic, White, a Republican from West, and his leadership team refused to answer any questions from Democrats if they continued to request that bills be read. 
White posted on social media that he shared a digital copy of a budget summary with House members on Tuesday and placed a physical copy of the summary on their desks on Wednesday. 
“When I was elected Speaker, I stated my goal was to bring more order and timeliness to the budget chaos while allowing all House members time to read and review the spending bills before they are asked to vote on them,” White said. “While we may not have perfected that process yet, as Speaker, I will maintain the goal of transparency and working in an orderly fashion.”
It appeared the House would continue to bicker over the budget after Republicans refused to allow members from both parties to ask questions in a House Appropriations Committee meeting, prompting further outrage from Democrats. 
“So, we’re not allowed to debate any piece of legislation in this process, is that correct?” Democratic Rep. John Hines of Greenville asked. 
“That’s correct,” House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Read, R-Gautier, responded. 
Read and other appropriations leaders cited the Democrats’ earlier filibuster tactics as the reason for not allowing them to ask questions. 
But some Republicans complained that the committee moved too fast for them to understand what was being proposed.
Rep. Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, during the committee meeting, asked a committee leader to repeat his brief explanation of an amendment to the budget for the State Auditor’s Office. 
Rep. Sam Mims V, a Republican from McComb, declined to repeat his explanation of the amendment and continued to speed through the budget. 
The committee meeting showcased how, in recent years, rank-and-file lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have complained they aren’t provided budget details in time to vet and debate the bills and how individual members have virtually no input in the budget process.
But longtime lawmakers said the special session this week was one of the worst budget-making cycles they’ve seen in roughly a decade. 
“I understand that we’re in the minority, and Republicans are in a supermajority, but there’s just no dialogue taking place,” Rep. Bryant Clark, a Democrat from Pickens, said. “This is the straw that broke the camel’s back.” 
Despite the chaos from the committee meeting, Democrats on the House floor stopped asking for bills to be read Wednesday night into Thursday morning, and Republicans chose to answer their questions. 
The most substantive debate on the House floor occurred over the Mississippi Development Authority’s budget, the agency responsible for economic development.
Rep. Robert Johnosn III, the Democratic leader, offered four amendments to the agency’s budget, but the GOP majority voted against them mostly along partisan lines. 
Johnson, a Democrat from Natchez, tried to amend the legislation to reduce the amount of money counties are required to contribute to economic development projects in areas with extremely high poverty rates or failing school districts. 
Rep. Karl Oliver, a Republican from Winona who leads an appropriations committee, opposed the amendments because he said he did not want the new proposals to jeopardize earlier agreements he reached with Senate leaders. 
Most agencies in the proposed budget will see flat funding with no major increases or decreases. But many agencies will see a drop-off starting July of millions of dollars in “one-time” money, either federal pandemic funds that are drying up or state cash for projects that lawmakers are withholding this year. 
Under the budget agreement, lawmakers are planning to leave about $1 billion unencumbered. Some legislative leaders say this is prudent, given federal cuts and uncertainty in Washington. Others question whether state agencies will suffer, and contractors go unpaid on already started projects, from not having capital expense money allocated in the coming year.
Some highlights of the spending agreements House and Senate leaders have reached for the coming budget year:
Medicaid: $969.9 million, a 6.69% increase
K-12 education: $3.34 billion, a .4% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in enrollment
Universities: $838.4 million, a .4% decrease
Community colleges: $299.4 million, a .22% increase
Department of Corrections: $438.2 million, a 4.4% increase

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-30 00:35:07+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House gives full passage to sprawling public health bill,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/ct-public-health-bill-federal-changes/,The bill would codify current federal guidance for fluoride in drinking water and create accounts to be tapped if federal funding is cut.,"The House on Thursday gave final passage to a bill focused on preempting potential federal changes to public health and reproductive care policy. 
The legislation includes sections that would codify into state law current federal guidance for fluoride in drinking water and create accounts to be tapped in the case of federal cuts to public health funding.
The Senate voted last week 25-10 to pass the bill, with one legislator missing the vote. The House vote Thursday was 92-55, with four representatives absent from voting.
“Public health is a little bit like a submarine, where it’s a lot beneath the surface and things we take for granted. I think there are a lot of things in this bill that help secure some of the things we take for granted,” Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said following the bill’s passage.
However, the version that passed through the House removed a section that would have allowed for the establishment of safe injection sites because of opposition from Governor Ned Lamont. 
According to House Speaker Matt Ritter, the governor’s staff communicated to him that Lamont would veto the entire bill if the section were included. At a press conference yesterday, the governor denied that he had made such a decision. But this morning Ritter said that’s not what he’d heard from Lamont’s staff.
“It was communicated to us and to the Senate that he would veto it by his chief of staff last night,” Ritter said. “I know there was this confusion yesterday. We have never been under any confusion in the House. We were told five days ago what he was going to do.”
Safe injection sites, also known as safe consumption sites or overdose prevention centers, are facilities where people can bring illegal substances to use under the supervision of trained staff in a clean environment with access to safety supplies, like clean needles and naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses. The bill referred to “overdose prevention centers,” which is a term used by advocates to reflect the broader services offered, including medical referrals and other social services.
McCarthy Vahey called the removal of the measure “gut wrenching,” but said she’s already thinking about how to implement the policy successfully in the future.
“I start today thinking about how we can plan going forward. Because we absolutely have to address the deaths in our state. This is a policy that I believe will work. And so how do we get more people on board?” McCarthy Vahey said.
Reproductive care
The legislation also contains provisions that would bolster access to reproductive care in the state. 
It would require hospital emergency rooms to provide services related to pregnancy complications, including miscarriage management and ectopic pregnancies, if they are necessary to treat the patient. 
It also creates a trigger to guarantee in Connecticut a federal right to emergency services under a law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, commonly referred to as “EMTALA.” If the federal government makes any changes to revoke EMTALA, or enforce it to a lesser degree, the DPH commissioner can adopt EMTALA provisions into DPH regulations — an attempt to guarantee EMTALA rights and enforcement in Connecticut, even if the federal government makes changes to the law.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, during the floor debate said the measure is necessary, given the changes to federal interpretation of EMTALA. The Trump administration dropped a case brought by the Biden administration against Idaho, which argued that hospitals had to provide emergency abortion care, despite the state’s abortion ban. 
“By dismissing that federal lawsuit against the state of Idaho, this means that there is no federal enforcement of EMTALA when hospitals do not provide the abortion care necessary to stabilize a patient’s health,” Gilchrest said.
Another provision would create a “safe harbor” account to pay for expenses, like food, lodging and meals, for people coming to Connecticut from other states to receive reproductive and gender affirming care. The fund would be managed by the state Treasurer and awarded as grants to nonprofits that provide reproductive and gender affirming care services. The fund would accept only private donations and would not include public money.
The measure elicited the strongest opposition from Republicans, who argued that even if the funds were private, the measure made use of taxpayer resources because of the work required by the Treasurer and his staff. 
“How does an elected official for the state of Connecticut collect donations from private providers then use his state-paid time and his staff’s state-paid time to invest them to create a profit to then give that money to a nonprofit who will distribute it as they see fit?” Nuccio said.
Several representatives also raised concerns about using government resources to manage funds for people outside of Connecticut. Others questioned why the fund was going toward reproductive services and not another issue in need of financial support.
Rep. Jay Case, R-Winchester, along with other Republicans, raised an amendment to change the recipients of the grants from nonprofits providing reproductive health services to those providing homelessness services. The amendment failed 48-99, with four legislators absent and not voting.
McCarthy Vahey acknowledged the many other needs that could use more funding, but said supporters were making a specific policy choice with this legislation. 
“There are absolutely a lot of things that we would all like to prioritize. The choice in this bill was to recognize that there are vulnerable people in places where it’s not legal to get safe and accessible health care,” she said.
Public health and other measures
The omnibus bill seeks to preempt several changes to public health policy by the Trump administration: It contains provisions to guarantee in state law the current federal standard for the level of fluoride in drinking water; allows the commissioner of the Department of Public health to create an advisory committee related to recommendations by federal public health agencies; and it creates accounts to shore up funds for public health emergency communications and in case of federal cuts to public health funding.
Several Republicans questioned why the bill was attempting to legislate for federal changes that hadn’t yet happened.
“I think the theme of the 2025 legislative session is ‘just in case,’” Rep. Nicole Klarides-Ditria, R-Seymour, ranking member of the Public Health Committee, said during the floor debate. “Just in case something happens in Washington, just in case the President does something. And, while I’m concerned about certain things, I don’t think we should legislate just in case.”
Democrats pushed back on the “just in case” notion during the floor debate, saying there are federal changes that are already happening. McCarthy Vahey also said the measures provide some predictability amidst a chaotic federal environment.
“It’s about providing consistency and predictability for the people of our state, for our water companies, for our public health officials locally,” McCarthy Vahey said. 
While the bill creates emergency accounts to shore up funds for emergencies, it doesn’t appropriate any funding to go into those accounts. McCarthy Vahey said, despite the lack of funding, the accounts serve as an indication of priorities.
While the sections addressing potential federal changes sparked a clash between parties, several of the other measures received bipartisan support. 
Multiple Republicans spoke in favor of the creation of a program to promote and provide referrals for pancreatic cancer screening, as well as a section that requires the correction ombuds to evaluate health care services provided by the Department of Correction to people who are incarcerated in the state.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0529_SR_Session_014-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 20:59:20.230259

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — An education bill that was once a vehicle for an education package advanced Thursday a lot leaner, as many of the proposals previously included failed to be attached as amendments to the bill. 
Legislative Bill 306, which largely ended up clean-up language sought by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil to address terms and provisions in state law relating to higher education, was brought back for debate after a previous attempt at the education package failed on the floor after lawmakers removed Central City’s State Sen. Loren Lippincott’s proposal allowing K-12 students to be excused during the school day for off-site religious instruction and coursework.
Lost in the shuffle again were three proposals that were once married — a measure that would have given Nebraska teachers more paid time off around significant life events, one offering student loan help for special education teachers and the release time proposal. 
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha’s measure would have helped schools fund more long-term substitutes so teachers can take paid time off. She revised it to give teachers two weeks of paid leave instead of three. The proposal would have funded the leave by implementing a new payroll fee on teacher salaries. The fee would also would have helped pay for special education teacher recruitment and retention.
Her amendment, backed by the state teachers union, failed 17-25. 
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln offered an amendment that would have provided forgivable loans for special education teachers in the state. Dungan’s proposal was combined into Spivey’s amendment, as the Legislature’s Education Committee had combined the two previously.  It also failed 20-23.
Lippincott brought back his release time proposal after lawmakers pulled it from the education package. He withdrew the attempt after Spivey and Dungan’s amendments failed.  The latest version of Lippincott’s proposal removed the private cause of action, the ability to sue if a school doesn’t enforce the ability to leave for that purpose, which some Republicans had expressed concerns about.
“This is going to be a filibuster; we need 33 votes,” Lippincott said during Thursday’s debate.  “I do not want my amendment to put the bill down.” 
Some social conservatives in the Legislature had been trying to show a growing base of lawmakers willing to consider and advance bills with religious themes.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the variant in a sample collected May 15 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the state Department of Health. As of Thursday morning, that’s been the only case confirmed in Washington, and it’s unclear whether the May 15 case was in a state resident or a visitor.
The case was found through the CDC’s Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance that detects COVID through voluntary nasal swabs and wastewater samples at a number of American airports.
Washington is one of a handful of states where a case has been reported.
As its prevalence has grown quickly around the world, the World Health Organization has designated the new variant, NB.1.8.1, as one “under monitoring.” NB.1.8.1 is fueling a spike in infections and hospitalizations in China, for example.
But the organization believes the variant doesn’t lead to more severe illness than current versions of the virus. Local health officials agree. 
“In general, I think that there’s low concern,” said Dr. Herbert Duber, regional medical officer with the state Department of Health. “But I think with any new variants, we really do need to monitor them.”
Current vaccines are expected to remain effective against NB.1.8.1.
But the new variant comes as the Trump administration has shifted vaccination guidelines. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced this week that the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for healthy children or pregnant women. The Trump administration has also limited eligibility for the vaccine, holding it should only be given to people over 65 or those with risk factors from other medical conditions.
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would require new testing to prove the shots are effective for younger people. 
Critics see these moves as unnecessary and dangerous.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections on Thursday tentatively approved a $57 million contract with two architectural engineering firms chosen in April to design a planned 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres of land in Franklin County.
The board agreed to meet and discuss the contract again sometime before June 10 in case members had any qualms about it being on the agenda of the legislative subcommittee responsible for further approving it.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced in March 2023 her intent to have the state build the mega-prison, and the Board of Corrections has greenlit a series of steps in the past several months to get the project off the ground while the state Legislature has been less approving.
Omaha, Neb.-based HDR and Little Rock-based Cromwell Architects Engineers will be the contracted design team, pending legislative approval. The board chose the two firms in April and chose the partnership of Nabholz Construction of Conway and J.E. Dunn Construction of Kansas City, Missouri, as the general contractor for the prison earlier this month.
Arkansas prison board chooses contractor to build new 3,000-bed penitentiary

Vanir Construction Management Inc. has been the prison’s project manager since October 2024, and Vanir “led the charge” on the architectural contract, “leaning heavily on their experience in this business,” Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told the corrections board Thursday.
“We’re going to design — or at least let you understand what it would cost to do — what 3,000 beds would look like, and then allow the state to choose how much [it’s] actually going to build based on how much is actually appropriated to use to build,” Vanir project manager Luann Salado said. “But we have to start somewhere.”
A $750 million appropriation bill to support the prison’s construction died after five failed votes in the Senate in April. State officials and Franklin County residents have fought against the project, citing concerns about transparency, infrastructure and staffing.
The appropriation would have covered the remainder of the projected $825 million cost of the project. An additional $75 million appropriated in 2022 for prison expansion has already been allocated to the Arkansas Department of Corrections, which can use the funding to move the project forward.
The Legislature also set aside another $330 million for the project in 2023 that hasn’t been appropriated yet.
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, said May 5 that he does not anticipate a special legislative session this year to address the failed $750 million appropriation.
Board member Lee Watson expressed concern Thursday that only part of the required 3,000-bed design might come to fruition due to funding constraints.
“If we utilize two-thirds of it and we stop, and then two or three years later the state picks this back up and decides to add 1,000 beds, that kind of makes me scratch my head a little,” he said.
Watson asked Corrections Department Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown if it would be “kosher within our budgeting process” to pay for the full design.
Brown said the contract will be a “pay as we go” arrangement as long as the total payment remains under an “authority dollar amount.” The contract allows the state to withdraw from it with seven days’ notice. 
Arkansas Legislature concludes 2025 legislative session; conflict over planned prison continues

Watson and board chairman Benny Magness said it bothered them that the contract mentioned Franklin County by name, and Watson said he hoped the contract would “allow for the possibility that we may have to begin with another location” if the Franklin County site has “issues that preclude it” from being used.
Some of the local frustration over the 815 acres of Franklin County land for the prison comes from the Indigenous Chickamauga Nation, which has said the project could have a negative impact on its burial sites in the area.
The HDR Cromwell contract has a clause that states the Board of Corrections will “appropriately adjust” if anything in the project will “materially change,” Wallace said.
The Arkansas Legislative Council’s Review subcommittee next meets June 17 and will be responsible for approving the HDR Cromwell contract before it goes to the full council for final approval.

Supporters have said the proposed limits on outpatient pharmaceutical drugs could provide the most immediate relief to patient costs of any measure lawmakers have considered this year.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA bill that supporters say would cut health care insurance costs for people across the state could have trouble getting over the finish line after the Senate made an eleventh hour change to its effective date late Thursday afternoon. That’s because the chamber now has another difference to reconcile with the House over the legislation, with potentially just a day left before the Legislature adjourns for the year.Senators approved a change to a portion of the bill that would cap the price of outpatient pharmaceuticals, which are generally administered via injection or infusion in hospitals or clinics, rather than dispensed by a pharmacy. They are often used to treat cancer, autoimmune disorders or other conditions. The House first tacked the measure onto H.266, which would make a number of other changes related to drug pricing.“This is the one thing that everybody is agreeing will actually reduce health care costs, and will do it quickly,” said Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, during a floor debate on the proposal. “Everything else that we are doing in all of these lovely bills … will take time.”As approved by the House, the bill would cap the cost of outpatient pharmaceuticals at 130% of their average sales price starting July 1, and 120% of their average sales price starting January 2026. But on Thursday, the Senate adopted an amendment proposed by Sen. Terry Williams, R-Rutland, to remove the transitional period altogether and push back the start of the lower cap to January. Senators voted for the change 20-10.The vote came just hours after Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, who chairs the Senate Health and Welfare Committee, said Senate leadership told her there wasn’t enough time for legislators to make more changes to the bill beyond what the House already had. That’s despite the fact, she said, that she saw some benefit to delaying the start of the cap.“I don’t like this process whatsoever,” Lyons told her committee earlier on Thursday afternoon. “I think if we make a change to the bill, we may not see it stay alive.”The Senate Health and Welfare Committee heard from witnesses both for and against the House’s proposed cap Thursday morning and into the afternoon.Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has said the proposal could reduce their requested premium increases — which are double digit percentages — for next year by four percentage points for individual and small group insurance plans on the health care marketplace, and three percentage points for school health insurance plans. “I cannot think of another policy change with such an immediate and profound impact on insurance premiums,” wrote Jessica Holmes, a member of the Green Mountain Care Board, in a memo to senators Thursday. “This cap would provide the most meaningful financial relief to Vermont’s sickest patients.”The Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, however, has said the proposed legislation would cause millions of dollars in losses, and would require multiple Vermont hospitals to cut staff or services. Williams cited those projected losses when presenting his amendment.During Thursday’s hearing, Peter Wright, CEO of Northwestern Medical Center, said the House proposal would leave the St. Albans hospital with “no other option” but to close its infusion center, where outpatient drugs are administered. Stephen Leffler, the president and COO of the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, said the legislation would reduce the hospital’s revenue by about $60 million, which could lead it to cut services. Both urged the committee to reject the House’s proposal.“We have had no time for planning for this — and no time to figure out the full impacts to everything that we do,” Leffler told the senators.The Senate’s change will now head back to the House for additional consideration in what could be the final hours of the session.— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowAs courts continue to weigh the fate of the Trump administration’s tariff policy, a Burlington-based women’s cycling apparel company stands at the center of the ongoing legal squabble, along with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.Terry Precision Cycling, or Terry Cycling, was one of five small businesses that sued President Donald Trump and his administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in April. The lawsuit prompted a ruling from a panel of three federal judges that struck down most of the president’s tariffs on Wednesday. Nik Holm, president of Terry Cycling, said that the Vermont company decided to fight against the administration’s trade policy after recognizing that the tariffs were “an existential threat” to its business.“We’re a company that reacts.

Appeal process, litigation and a possible injunction still loom, but otherwise roundups culminating in the complete removal of two herds, and a portion of another, will begin within weeks.
The post BLM decides over 3,000 wild horses can be eliminated from Wyoming’s ‘checkerboard’ starting July 15 appeared first on WyoFile .","A contentious plan to fully eliminate free-roaming horses from a Delaware-sized region in southwest Wyoming has cleared its environmental review process, and roundups are scheduled to start in about seven weeks. 
The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday announced it has signed off on its earlier proposal to permanently remove more than 3,000 feral equines that dwell in the Great Divide Basin, Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town herd areas. That proposal, outlined in an environmental assessment, elicited 2,138 comments from people and parties who wanted to share their views about horses dwelling in BLM’s Rock Springs and Rawlins field offices.
“I have carefully considered all public comments received on the EA and wish to thank all commenters for their interest in wild horse management in the project area,” BLM Rock Springs Field Office Manager Kimberlee Foster wrote in her decision, which was signed on Thursday. “This decision will be effective upon issuance and the actual gather start date will be subsequently scheduled.”

Over the course of 2025 and 2026, the Bureau of Land Management plans to fully remove roaming horses from herd management areas illustrated in this map. (BLM)
In a press release announcing the decision, BLM officials disclosed that start date: July 15. 
The 2025 operation is expected to stretch for two months and target an estimated 3,624 horses in the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town herds. (The Great Divide Basin herd removal will follow in 2026.) This year’s operations are the largest horse-removal effort scheduled to take place across the West, according to the BLM’s tentative wild horse and burro gather schedule. 
“Litigation” is listed as the purpose of the Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town operations in that schedule. 
Wyoming’s checkerboard region — a 40-mile-wide region where public and private land meet at common corners — has not only spawned the high-profile public land access dispute that could be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. It’s also caused a long-running dispute over free-roaming horse management.
Some 15 years ago, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for feral horses to roam its property.

Wild horse advocacy groups and the horse-leery grazing association have been sparring with the BLM ever since. Lawsuits from both parties have targeted the BLM’s planned actions, but last summer U.S. District Court for Wyoming Judge Kelly Rankin, a Biden appointee, ruled in the federal government’s favor in both cases.
Subsequently, a coalition of pro-horse petitioners — the American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project, Carol Walker, Kimerlee Curyl and Chad Hanson — petitioned the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments took place in March. 
“I think we just have to keep our powder dry and wait and see which way the court rules so we can figure out our next steps,” Western Watersheds Project Executive Director Erik Molvar said.
BLM’s Foster expects that decision “soon,” she wrote in response to emailed questions. 
“If that decision alters the planned gather,” she wrote, “BLM will notify the public.”

Foster’s decision also marked the onset of an administrative appeal process. Within 30 days, members of the public and organizations that “have standing” and submitted comments during earlier stages of the federal environmental review process can appeal. 
“The appeal must state clearly and concisely why you think the decision is in error,” Foster wrote in her decision. 
Because Office of Hearings and Appeals regulations don’t allow electronic filing, appeals must be sent via snail mail. They must be “served simultaneously” to the following three addresses: 

Rock Springs Field Office280 Highway 191 North Rock Springs, Wyoming 82901Office of Hearings and Appeals 
Interior Board of Land Appeals801 North Quincy St., Suite 300Arlington, Virginia  22203 
Office of the Regional Solicitor Rocky Mountain Region 755 Parfet St., Suite 151 Lakewood, Colorado  80215

When the 30-day appeal period lapses on June 28, there are no additional steps in the BLM’s process. The documents released Thursday constitute the final decision to authorize the whole-herd removals, according to Foster.
Free-roaming horses gathered out of the Great Divide Basin, Salt Wells Creek and Adobe Town herd areas are offered up through BLM’s adoption and sales programs. Those not selected or of the right temperament will live out their days pastured on private land in places like the Centennial Valley west of Laramie or Oklahoma.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s announcement of the intent to revoke Chinese student visas could affect more than 50,000 at California universities and colleges — and prove particularly costly to UC and Cal State campuses already facing budget cuts. 


The Trump administration’s latest vow to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas could affect as many 50,000 students in California, a population larger than Palm Springs. 
Sending those students home would have far-ranging financial impacts. Foreign students not only pay higher tuition than in-state students, but they also feed local economies with the dollars they spend with local businesses. There are intangibles as well: Many of these international students have remained in the US after graduation, with some becoming famous scientists or business leaders. 
In announcing the new policy Wednesday, the State Department said it was “putting America first, not China.” The policy comes amid a tense trade war between the two countries. In its statement, the State Department did not specify when it would begin revoking visas or who, specifically, would be targeted, except that it would include “those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.” 
California faces a $12 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year, and the University of California and the California State University system could face 3% cuts to their budgets as a result. 
The loss of so many international students could make these fiscal problems worse. The UC is “concerned” about the State Department’s decision, said Stett Holbrook, a spokesperson for the UC president’s office. “Chinese students, as well as all our international students, scholars, faculty and staff, are vital members of our university community and contribute greatly to our research, teaching, patient care and public service mission.”
At UC Davis, more than 3,600 students, or just over 9% of the student body, came from China — the highest of any UC campus — according to the UC system’s Fall 2024 enrollment data. University of Southern California, a private university, had almost twice as many students from China this year. The Cal States and California’s community college system also enroll hundreds and possibly thousands of students from China. 

San Jose State has the largest population of international students of any Cal State campus, according to a State Department-funded survey through the Institute of International Education. “This spring alone, we are proud to have approximately 4,000 international students from 88 countries enriching our campus, hundreds of them graduating last week,” said campus spokesperson Michelle Smith McDonald. “Ongoing national events,” such as the State Department’s recent statement, “are raising questions and concerns” for those students. 
For one sophomore at UC Santa Barbara, the announcement could create a “huge interruption” in her life, she said. 
The student agreed to be interviewed on the condition that she only be identified by her nickname, Huhu, because she fears her visa could be targeted. She said she just signed a lease, which expires June 2026. Like many Chinese students in the US, Huhu didn’t take the Chinese national university entrance exam and instead took the SAT and AP exams in order to study in the US. She said she couldn’t enroll at a Chinese university now, even if she tried. 
“We’re also scared about discrimination,” she said. “If we’re in a state where our visa could be canceled at any time, it’s an action that encourages people to discriminate against the international student community.”
In the last few months, President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked visas for thousands of international students across the US, especially those who have participated in campus protests or have disciplinary issues on their records, including speeding tickets or other minor infractions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also asked US embassies to stop scheduling all new visa interviews for international students, Politico reported. 
The administration recently restored some international students’ visa status following orders from federal judges. Court orders have also blocked another effort by the Trump administration to prevent Harvard University from enrolling international students. 
But California students are worried these court orders may not last long. On Tuesday, the student government at UCLA issued a resolution calling on the school to provide “clear guidance” about its action plan in the event that Trump targets its international students. 
Keya Tanna, a junior from Dubai, was part of the committee that issued that resolution. On Tuesday, she became the international student representative for UCLA’s student government. It’s been a whirlwind, she said. “There’s a deep concern and a sense of fear amongst everyone.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/100323-UC-Davis-E-Bikes-Scooters-MG-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-29 20:04:11.588953

The company reported a pipeline spill on May 26, 2025, that released an estimated 3 million gallons of produced water in Williams County. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A pipeline failure in northwest North Dakota caused an estimated 73,000 barrels, or nearly 3.1 million gallons, of brine to spill in Williams County, the Department of Environmental Quality reported this week.
Continental Resources staff discovered the spill about 1:35 p.m., Monday about 16 miles northeast of Williston and notified state regulators, said Marty Haroldson with the Division of Water Quality.
“This would be a larger spill,” Haroldson said Wednesday.
Brine, or produced water, is a waste byproduct of oil production that can be destructive to land. The spill contaminated grassy land near the site of the pipeline failure, Haroldson said. Brine also contaminated an unnamed tributary that eventually flows into Stony Creek.
The spill did not reach Stony Creek and has had no known impacts to drinking water sources, Haroldson said.
An incident report indicates that trucks began removing fluid from the site earlier this week and crews blocked culverts and set up berms to contain the contamination. Crews were working to excavate the pipeline to repair it, according to the incident report.
A Continental Resources representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday.
Department of Mineral Resources Director Nathan Anderson said the pipeline has been shut down and drained of fluid. The pipeline, installed in 2015, is made of high density polyethylene and had a monitoring system, Anderson said.
The cause of the spill is under investigation. Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Mineral Resources staff are inspecting the site and will be overseeing the investigation and cleanup.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A countdown clock ticked down in front of the State House on Thursday afternoon — 20 days. That’s how many days union workers and activists estimate are left before the Rhode Island General Assembly passes its fiscal 2026 budget.
“TIME IS NOW. TIME IS NOW,” the crowd of around 150 people chanted as they called on lawmakers to pass a bill to increase income taxes on top earners in Rhode Island to raise revenue to prop up hospitals, plug a $32.6 million deficit at the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority and fund programs like Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Head Start that help the state’s poorest residents.
At least one RIPTA driver was among the crowd, which included over 30 striking Butler Hospital workers plus members of RI AFL-CIO, Climate Action Rhode Island, National Education Association of Rhode Island, Economic Progress Institute, Revenue for Rhode Islanders Coalition, RI Working Families Party, SEIU-1199, Indivisible RI and Reclaim RI.
Companion bills introduced in February by Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, and Sen. Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat, call for a 3% surtax on the top 1% of earners — those who make more than $625,000 a year, based on 2025, inflation-adjusted numbers. 
Alzate’s bill received its initial hearing before the House Committee on Finance on May 6 where it was held for further study by the panel. Murray’s bill was scheduled for a hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance Thursday evening.
“The wealthy have been benefiting from state and federal tax cuts for decades,” Murray told the crowd. “But at whose expense? Ours.”
The proposal would affect about 5,700 state income tax filers and generate an extra $190 million in annual revenue for the state, according to the Economic Progress Institute, which backs the legislation.
“This is not crazy — it’s reasonable, it’s fair, and it’s long overdue,” Nina Harrison, policy director for the Economic Progress Institute, told the crowd.
“It’s the end of the session — this is rally time,” AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said. “This is when we make our final argument that this is about building a Rhode Island economy from the worker up and giving the state the resources they need to make sure we have functioning systems that everyday people rely on.”
Crowley, who sits on RIPTA’s board of directors, said if Rhode Island’s wealthiest residents paid more in taxes, then the statewide bus agency could solve its financial woes. Funding could also go toward the state’s health care system, he said.
“Which would allow workers like the striking Butler workers to have a living wage,” he said.

Negotiations resume, but no progress made
Butler Hospital unionized workers represented by SEIU 1199E returned to the State House for at least the third time in their now two-week long strike, rallying for better working conditions and wages at the Providence psychiatric hospital. 
A negotiator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) — a federal agency that helps smooth out labor disputes — sat down Wednesday and Thursday to revive talks between the striking Butler workers and their employer, Care New England. There were no immediate updates on the status of the talks from union officials as of Thursday evening.
Dawn Williams, a Butler registered nurse, union delegate, member of the bargaining committee explained in a statement Wednesday evening while the day’s talks failed to find consensus.
“Unfortunately, management gave us a set of proposals with lower wages, higher healthcare costs, less on retirement and no movement on our workplace violence committee,” Williams said. “We are more than ready to return to work and resume caring for our patients — but we should never have to choose between our safety, our livelihoods, and the profession we love.”
Mary E. Marran, Butler’s president and COO, issued a statement Thursday.
“While the Hospital remains committed to productive dialogue, we are concerned by the union’s apparent lack of advanced preparation for Wednesday’s session, and its continued focus on internal union matters such as changes to new hire orientation, rather than on issues central to our employees’ core priorities—such as wages, retirement benefits, and healthcare,” Marran wrote.
Marran wrote that the hospital presented a “scaled-back economic proposal” on Wednesday because of conditions established during the last negotiating session on May 7, when it gave its “Last, Best, and Final Offer,” with any subsequent offers shaped by “the effects of the strike, which has affected patients, staff, the community, and the Hospital itself.” 
Marran added that the wages are still higher than those in previous contracts, and pointed to the hospital’s negotiation website, butlerinfoforyou.org.
Care New England spokesperson Raina C. Smith did not supply an exact dollar amount when asked Thursday how much the hospital has spent on temporary labor thus far. She simply replied, “Millions.”

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)BEULAH, North Dakota – A former coal mine in western North Dakota that will be converted into a processing site for nickel mined in Minnesota was touted Wednesday as a way for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other countries for critical minerals needed for electronics and electric vehicles.
The processing plant operated by Talon Metals will bring 150 jobs to Beulah, with processing expected to begin in 2028.
Electric vehicle maker Tesla has contracted to buy about half the nickel processed in Beulah. Mike Kicis, president of Talon Metals, said the Department of Defense is another likely user of the nickel and other minerals.
The raw ore will come from a mine near Tamarack in north-central Minnesota. It will be shipped by rail about 475 miles west to the Westmore Mining site just outside Beulah.
The reborn mine site was introduced as the Beulah Minerals Processing Facility in an agreement signing ceremony in Beulah.
North Dakota officials were at the signing ceremony to highlight what they said was the importance of domestic production of critical minerals such as nickel. 
“It is a real national security issue,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said of the U.S. reliance on China and countries for critical minerals such as nickel.
Armstrong said the agreement is “proof that North Dakota could be a leader in cutting edge, innovative projects combining economic development with environmental responsibility and community engagement.”
The plan is contingent on permitting in North Dakota and Minnesota and at the federal level. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality is among the agencies that will review the project.
The mine has been opposed by some Native American and environmental groups in Minnesota that say the mining could pollute sensitive waters.
Kicis said Talon has tried to address environmental concerns at the mine site by making plans for a building over the mine opening so railcars can be loaded indoors.
Some of the environmental concerns have been about the processing that is slated for Beulah and the waste, also known as tailings, that results from separating the nickel and other minerals.
Talon officials said Wednesday that there are potential uses for the waste, such as concrete, with the ash from burned coal as an ingredient.
U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said the $365 million investment is an economic win and by recycling the waste products to make road-building materials, is an environmental win.
The project is being supported by a nearly $115 million Department of Energy grant that was announced by the Biden administration in 2022.
Kicis said that without the federal grant, the project would have been “a real challenge.”
While welcomed by local officials, the project also will create some challenges, such as attracting labor and having enough housing for the workers at the new project.
“All good things are a challenge,” Granville “Beaver” Brinkman, the economic development director for Beulah, said.
He said when the mine was at its peak, it had about 100 employees. Since it has been in its reclamation phase, he said there have been about 40 workers at the site. Coal production stopped at the site in 2022.
Beulah Mayor Sean Cheatley said he hopes that there won’t be the need for crew camps when construction starts next year as planned. He said there also will be increased traffic for the town to deal with, but said it is good for the community and its neighbors.
“It’s good for Beulah. It’s good for Hazen. It’s good for Mercer County. It’s good for the whole nation,” Cheatley said.

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
‘Wasteful grants’
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
Impact on communities nationwide
In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.



We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-29 22:59:49+00:00,CT Mirror,Felicia Rubinstein on founding HAYVN Coworking: ‘Exactly what I wish I had’,Gabby DeBenedictis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/felicia-rubinstein-hayvn-coworking/,Rubinstein explored her origin story and desire to start a women-centered coworking space in the fourth installment of ‘This Could Work.’,"Felicia Rubinstein’s career has taken her down many paths — from mechanical engineering to training and marketing at companies like Apple and GE to cofounding a branding and web development agency — but she says her current role as founder of HAYVN Coworking is a reflection of her core values.
HAYVN, a women-centered coworking space that began in Darien and has since expanded to Greenwich, is designed for freelancers, solo entrepreneurs and remote workers to have a place to work, make new connections and access resources. 
For Rubinstein, it combines her entrepreneurial spirit, a love of work, and years of experience in corporate settings that weren’t always friendly to women — all topics she discussed with CT Mirror State Policy Editor Erica E. Phillips at the Ferguson Library in Stamford Wednesday night for the fourth installment of “This Could Work,” a series exploring the stories of Connecticut entrepreneurs.
[WATCH: This Could Work! with HAYVN Coworking]
As a child, Rubinstein looked up to her grandfather, a Polish immigrant who arrived in Cuba at age 16 and “there, on his own, he was selling ties in the streets. Just wandering around, selling ties.” He made his way to the United States and ultimately turned that gig into a 20-person business that sold clothes and, later, furs.
“He is my inspiration. When I was a kid, he would always ask me what business I was doing,” Rubinstein said, saying he was proud of the various jobs she held.
After graduating college with a degree in mechanical engineering, Rubinstein started her career designing battle tanks — “so not what I wanted, but when you’re desperate, you do that” — before a stint at GE teaching computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing to engineers. 
Eventually, a move from California to the New York City area for her husband to attend New York University’s business school led her to a job at Apple, which had its East Coast corporate office in Norwalk at the time. There, she remembers feeling the need to hide her pregnancy from colleagues out of fear of losing her job, and she ended up leaving the company because of a lack of child care.
That experience, along with a stint at a software company she described as “a man’s club” where she was the only woman on a 15-person leadership board, shaped her desire to support women in the professional world.
HAYVN Coworking
But what specifically led her to start HAYVN?
After leaving Apple and before joining the software company, Rubinstein founded a marketing agency specializing in branding and web development for clients like the Palace Theater in Waterbury, The Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk, financial companies and nonprofits. 
Rubinstein wanted her clients to meet each other, so she started hosting gatherings for them to connect.
“We didn’t have a real place to do this, so I found an office suite rental place, and we just rented out their space, you know, once a month and did seminars,” she said. “So that was the beginning of the coworking piece.”
An idea was forming, one that continued to take shape during a summer Rubinstein spent away from work. 
In between attending Broadway shows, taking classes, and biking around New York City, she began listening to NPR’s “How I Built This” podcast, and one of the guests was Miguel McKelvey, a co-founder of WeWork. Rubinstein found herself fascinated while listening to him talk about coworking, a concept previously unfamiliar to her.
“I wanted to just learn more about it,” she said. “And I was like, ‘This is exactly what I wish I had had through all this time,’ was like, community, a space, a place to work.”
But after visiting a couple WeWorks, she determined it was what she called “a bro-working space” (rather than coworking) that catered to younger people. So she put her own spin on the concept, creating a coworking space designed for women, complete with events, networking opportunities, and a sense of community and business activity.
“There’s so many avenues to get support in the state, and I was learning all that (in securing support for HAYVN),” she said. “And I really wanted to become the hub, a place that would be able to point people in the direction to get that support.”
And as for the company’s name? Rubinstein had previously created a marketing agency called Maven Marketing, so she was thinking through rhymes for “maven” when her brain went to “haven.” She liked that it conjured up images of a “safe haven,” a comfortable place.
But she knew spelling it “H-A-V-E-N” would be poor search engine optimization, given the plethora of other organizations with “haven” in their name — and that a “haven.org” URL wouldn’t be available — so she landed on the “H-A-Y-V-N” spelling instead.
Rubinstein’s ultimate goal is to open three HAYVN spaces along the I-95 corridor. With last week’s ribbon-cutting of the Greenwich location, that leaves room for one more. The goal is tacked up on her bulletin board, as is a quote that she said sums up the entrepreneurial spirit: 
“Proceed as if success is inevitable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Felicia-Rubinstein-This-Could-Work-1024x654.jpg,,,2025-05-29 19:05:33.281004

The raid began around 7:15 a.m. Tuesday, when several vehicles arrived at the site and a helicopter hovered overhead. A worker who spoke with Fox 8 anonymously said crews with the M.R. Pittman Group were just starting their day.
“They had the whole site surrounded on all sides,” the worker said. “They were grabbing everyone at the work site.”
According to the worker, nearly every person on-site was questioned and asked to provide proof of residency or a work permit, including him. He said he is living and working in Louisiana on a U visa, a non-immigrant visa that allows certain victims of crime and their families to live and work in the U.S. for a limited time while they apply for permanent residency.

“They came to me and put me under arrest and demanded my documents,” he said. “I just had to show them my work permit and my driver’s license, and they didn’t arrest me.”
Despite multiple media requests to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), officials have not disclosed the number of people detained, the number of arrests, the reasons for the arrests, or the identities of those taken into custody.
“I would say it was around 12 to 15 people who were actually arrested,” the worker said.
Mayra Pineda, with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana, expressed concern that the arrests could cause fear among Hispanic laborers.
“This is an impact that will affect everyone,” Pineda said. “At this point there is general panic, not only for Hispanic businesses but for businesses in general that employ Hispanics.”
M.R. Pittman has not commented on how the arrests might affect the $30 million federally funded drainage project. The company has also not stated how many of its workers were detained or arrested by ICE.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Washington’s leading Catholic bishops filed a lawsuit Thursday contending the new state law requiring religious leaders to report child abuse or neglect, even when it is disclosed in confession, is unconstitutional and should be invalidated.
They argue the law violates their First Amendment right to practice religion free of government interference, and is religious discrimination because it will force priests to violate their sacred vows or face punishment by the state.
It also violates a provision of the state constitution guaranteeing “freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, belief and worship,” they assert.
They want the law set aside and an injunction barring criminal investigations or prosecution of Roman Catholic clergy for not divulging information learned in confession.
The new law “puts Roman Catholic priests to an impossible choice: violate 2,000 years of Church teaching and incur automatic excommunication or refuse to comply with Washington law and be subject to imprisonment, fine, and civil liability,” the suit reads.
Archbishop Paul Etienne of Seattle, along with Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima and Bishop Thomas Daly of Spokane, are the lead plaintiffs in the suit filed in the U.S. District Court in Tacoma. Gov. Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown and the prosecuting attorney in each of Washington’s 39 counties are named as defendants.
Hiram Sasser, executive general counsel for First Liberty Institute, one of the groups representing the bishops, called the law “a brazen act of religious discrimination.”
“For centuries, Catholic priests have been willing to die as martyrs rather than violate this sacred duty. A few politicians in Washington state won’t break them. And the Constitution protects them,” he said in a statement.
First Liberty Institute represented the Bremerton High School football coach who successfully challenged his firing for gathering with players to pray on the field following games. That case went to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Mike Faulk, a spokesman for the Washington attorney general, said in an email that they are reviewing the suit.
A Ferguson spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment from the governor.
This legal fight centers on Senate Bill 5375, which Ferguson signed into law on May 2 and will take effect July 27. 
It adds clergy members to the state’s list of individuals legally required to report suspected child abuse to law enforcement or the Department of Children, Youth and Families.
Disclosures in confession or other rites where the religious leader is bound to confidentiality are not exempt. But under the law, they will retain their privilege to not be compelled to testify in related court cases or criminal proceedings.
Catholic leaders assert in the suit that existing policies adopted by the dioceses in Seattle, Yakima and Spokane “go further in the protection of children than the current requirements of Washington law.”
They also iterate that confession of sins is one of the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church and is protected by the sacramental seal, which forbids sharing anything disclosed by a penitent.
“The use of a religious practice to further the State’s policy goals violates basic constitutional principles prohibiting the excessive entanglement of church and state,” the suit reads. With the law in place, priests would be forced to choose between “temporal criminal punishment and eternal damnation,” it adds. 
The Washington State Catholic Conference opposed the bill largely because it did not exempt disclosures heard in the confessional.
“This trust is sacred, and any law that jeopardizes it risks discouraging those who recognize the harm they have caused from seeking moral guidance,” said Jean Hill, the organization’s executive director, in a statement.
When he signed the bill, Ferguson said keeping the confessional in the bill did not give him pause.
As a Catholic, he said, “I’m very familiar with it. Been to confession, myself. I felt this was important legislation for protecting kids.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ferguson-clergy-bill-signing-may-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-29 19:05:33.281004

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Another last-minute attempt by State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln to force a vote this session on a legislative proposal to slow Nebraska’s voter-approved minimum wage increases failed Thursday to join an unrelated bill.  
This time, she tried attaching the amendment to State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area’s Legislative Bill 265, a budget bill with business overtones that dealt with unemployment insurance tax rates and the Workforce Development Program Cash Fund. 
Opponents trying to stop the effort by Raybould, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, filed motions to filibuster the amendment and keep it from being considered — a tactic her fellow Democrats used to successfully block it from becoming part of a bill Wednesday weakening Nebraska’s paid sick leave protections, LB 415, which is heading to the governor’s desk. 
Raybould said before withdrawing her amendment that she “was going to do everything” to work within the rules and follow the regulations of the body. She emphasized that if the rules had been followed, her bill would not have failed after Sorrentino missed the vote on final reading, because lawmakers would have been able to reconsider it on the same day and pass her standalone bill.

“I made a commitment to all the business leaders out there that are in the lobby [and] to the small businesses, daycare centers, dog groomers and yoga studios,” Raybould said. 
Raybould also emphasized that she wants to act now, saying the political dynamics facing her bill change if lawmakers wait. She said it would be harder to reduce pay for young people after the voter-approved law has taken effect. 
Her revived proposal, in its current form, would shrink the wage increases by setting the annual increase for adults at 1.75%. It also would create a youth minimum wage and amend a separate state training wage for people ages 16 to 19 in the first 90 days on the job.
Raybould and supporters of her changes said they would protect small businesses that could not afford to pay more. Lawmakers against slowing wage growth said they were defending the people’s will.
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha said Sorrentino’s bill was “hijacked by the Senator Raybould show” during the debate as she was taking a “third bite of the apple.”
“What troubles me about small business owners like Senator Raybould … is that they have more solidarity with large corporations than they do with the workers themselves,” said Hunt, who runs a small store in Omaha.
Raybould withdrew her amendment after it looked like lawmakers wouldn’t have the time to consider the amendment, which many believe had the votes needed to pass. But before she pulled her amendment, she pushed back on what she called “misrepresented dialogue” from Democratic-aligned lawmakers against her proposal.
“It’s not something that we’re doing to save money, as some have alleged; it’s really to be an incentive to hire young people,” Raybould said.  “I think there are several things that the Legislature can do to strike a balance on the [wage] increase approved in November and not forcing our small and medium businesses to shutter or sell out.” 
Opposed lawmakers eventually pulled amendments related to the filibuster of Raybould’s minimum wage amendment, but only after responding to her speech, letting the base bill, LB 265, eventually advance.
One state senator, speaking privately, said the drama from Thursday showed the statehouse is “not a serious place,” and that lawmakers are not “serious people.”

Gretchen Whitmer gives keynote address at Mackinac Policy Conference on May 29, 2025 | Photo from Whitmer's officeMACKINAC ISLAND – Delivering her seventh address to attendees of the annual Mackinac Policy Conference, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer recounted hard fought victories and future challenges, assuring Michiganders that they can do hard things. 
First on her list of hard things she’d accomplished in office, Whitmer pointed to her efforts to secure a new fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, which culminated in President Donald Trump announcing 21 new F-15EX fighter aircraft to base there alongside previously promised KC-46A refueling tankers that had been previously announced.
“Oh we didn’t put a picture of me and my new bestie up there did we?” Whitmer joked, as she switched to a slide of photos of her at Selfridge, absent Trump.
She also pointed to her work to expand Michigan’s Medicaid program during her time as minority leader of the then GOP-led State Senate, with Republicans also controlling the House and the governor’s seat. 
“I knew we had to seize the chance to expand health care to hundreds of thousands more Michiganders. And you know what? Governor [Rick] Snyder supported it, too, and our only chance of getting it done was working together,” Whitmer said. 
The governor also touted her administration’s goal of 60% of Michigan adults to hold a degree or certificate by 2030, supported by programs to provide Michiganders access to college and trade certificate programs for free, or at a reduced rate. 
Michigan lawmakers were also able to reach a deal to preserve Michigan’s tipped minimum wage and trim back new sick time requirements, Whitmer noted, as business groups raised concerns that court-ordered changes would cause mass restaurant closures and widespread layoffs. 
“We can do hard things. To succeed you gotta be willing to work with people you disagree with about most things,” Whitmer said. 
“It’s the harder path in the moment, but it’s always the right path. Success requires thinking about ways to help the whole team instead of just having your own staff,” Whitmer said.
However there are still hard things to do, Whitmer said, pointing to the state’s literacy crisis with just a quarter of Fourth graders able to read proficiently. 
While this crisis is affecting all Michigan children, Whitmer noted that boys were falling behind, with girls reading at a higher level. 
“The next hard thing we must do is make sure that every kid in Michigan can read. We must focus every education policy to meet this high-level goal until we hit it. As the State Board of Education hires their new superintendent, I urge them to pick a candidate with a proven record on literacy,” Whitmer said.
The state has already built momentum on this goal, Whitmer noted, as she’d signed legislation last year to move schools back to the science of reading strategies, and require schools to screen for dyslexia. 
The state also needs a long-term sustainable plan for road funding, Whitmer said. In 2019, she failed to secure a long-term funding solution for road repairs as her proposal to raise the gas tax didn’t play with the GOP-Controlled Legislature. In its place, Whitmer received approval for a $3.5 billion road bonding plan. 
However as bond funding dries up, the state will need to compromise on a plan with both cuts and new streams of revenue to support repairs and infrastructure, Whitmer said.
The governor also set a goal to secure a semiconductor chip manufacturing plant and begin construction by the end of next year, telling conference attendees that she’s been directly advocating to the Trump Administration on this front
“This is an intergenerational investment that makes an entire region an economic magnet, inspiring families to move here and put down roots. For a long time, the United States made 0% of the world’s advanced chips. We heeded too much ground to foreign competition, and now, thanks to plants being built nationwide, we’re growing fast. Michigan should get in on the game,” Whitmer said. 
“It won’t be easy, but it’s okay, because we can do hard things,” Whitmer said. 
Looking to the future, the only thing that’s certain is uncertainty Whitmer noted, assuring conference attendees that she’s been tracking every twist on tariff policies and efforts to strip billions from Medicaid and SNAP benefits. 
“These are serious issues with huge stakes for Michigan, from workers in the auto supply chain to parents figuring out next month’s budget. We can do hard things in Michigan, but we’re also living through hard times. We have to acknowledge what’s within our control and what’s not,” Whitmer said. 
However, Whitmer looked to Detroit’s population growth for the second year in a row as a source of inspiration.
“I remember sitting in that audience and watching [former Gov.] Bill Milliken give a speech from this podium, talking about as Detroit grows, so goes the state of Michigan. This was during some of those hardest times, and here we are now. We should all feel pride of our flagship city, a place that has risen from a past defined by hardship to a future driven by endless possibilities,” Whitmer said.
“Detroit does hard things as a state. We’ve done a lot over the last couple of years, but we’re not done yet. Let’s continue leading by example as a state that does hard things in the right way. And let’s remember that we’re all on the same team, team Michigan.” Whitmer said. 
Whitmer speaks out on pardons for kidnap plotters
Following her speech, Whitmer sat down with Blue Cross Blue Shield President and CEO Tricia Keith, who asked Whitmer about Trump’s recent comments that he would “take a look at” pardons for two men convicted in a plot to kidnap and kill her in 2020. 
Whitmer pointed to a sketch from Key and Peele depicting former President Barack Obama’s anger translator. 
“I did all the interviews, they said ‘How do you feel about this,’ I said well I’m disappointed but my anger translator would use more colorful language,” Whitmer said.
“No one should hesitate to condemn political violence, whether it is aimed at my good friend Josh Shapiro, the horror that played out at their residence in Pennsylvania, or it is the man who shot Donald Trump, or it is people that threatened me, it’s unacceptable. And so it is my hope that he doesn’t go forward with that,” Whitmer said. 
However, Whitmer said she has an ongoing dialogue with the President in contrast to his first administration, and that she would take every opportunity to make the case for Michigan.

Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton, center, spoke about the GOP's budget bill in a press conference at the Colorado State Capitol on May 29, 2025. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Speaking over heckling chants from a nearby crowd of protesters, two of Colorado’s top Republicans stood outside the state Capitol on Thursday, defending their party’s sweeping federal budget bill in a press conference that leaned heavily on a series of misleading claims about Medicaid and immigration.
U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton were among the 215 House Republicans who voted last week to approve the bill, which includes many of President Donald Trump’s key domestic policy priorities. Despite deep cuts to social programs, headlined by the largest-ever reduction in Medicaid spending, the bill’s tax cuts and new funding for the military and border security mean it would add an estimated $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years.
“This is a victory for our values, for our communities and for our American way of life,” Boebert told reporters. “It’s about cutting wasteful spending — the waste, the fraud, the abuse, the illegal aliens who are receiving taxpayer benefits.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We are protecting Medicaid for the people that need it most,” Evans said. “We are removing 1.4 million illegal immigrants from the taxpayer-funded rolls of Medicaid.”
Immigrants in the U.S. unlawfully are not eligible for federal Medicaid benefits. Republicans’ budget bill would enact multibillion-dollar penalties for 14 states, including Colorado, that choose to cover some undocumented immigrants using state funds. But regardless of how states respond to those new rules, the vast majority of the funding cuts and insurance coverage losses projected to result from the bill will fall on citizens and lawful residents.
Under a program that went into effect this year, income-eligible pregnant people and children can receive some benefits from Colorado’s state-administered Medicaid program regardless of their immigration status. The state Department of Health Care Policy and Financing estimates the program will cover about 15,000 undocumented individuals in 2025, at a cost of $50.8 million.
Those figures represent a small fraction of the annual loss of roughly $1 billion the state faces under the GOP bill’s Medicaid changes, and of the 124,000 to 207,000 current enrollees who are projected to lose coverage, according to the nonprofit KFF. Most of the coverage losses would result from the bill’s rollback of Biden-era rules aimed at streamlining enrollment and renewal, and enactment of new obstacles in the form of more frequent eligibility checks and work requirements for able-bodied adults without children.
Many health care advocates say those new hurdles will tie up Medicaid programs in red tape and deny coverage to millions of eligible Americans. Nearly two-thirds of Medicaid recipients are already employed, and nearly all the rest are caregivers, students and people with disabilities. Studies have shown that state-level Medicaid work requirements, like one enacted in Arkansas, result in substantial losses of coverage and higher administrative costs, but no change in the rate of employment.
“Without Medicaid, people die,” Sara Loflin, executive director of the advocacy group ProgressNow Colorado, said in a statement Thursday. “Evans wants voters to believe that the people who will lose coverage don’t deserve health care, but thousands of Coloradans will fall through the cracks, and some of them will die as a result of Evans’ vote.”

Evans in the spotlight
Evans and Boebert were joined at Thursday’s press conference by GOP state Sen. Byron Pelton of Sterling, Rep. Carlos Barron of Fort Lupton and Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams. The group spoke for about 45 minutes as a few dozen activists from ProgressNow and other left-leaning groups, separated from the press conference by a few yards and a loose cordon of Colorado State Patrol officers, shouted in protest — especially of Evans, the first-term representative from Colorado’s battleground 8th Congressional District.
Despite representing one of the nation’s most evenly divided districts, Evans, a former state lawmaker who won his seat by fewer than 2,500 votes last year, has done little to distance himself from Trump or House Republican leadership during his first five months in Congress. Demonstrators chanted and held signs urging Evans to hold in-person town hall events to hear from his constituents, something he has so far refused to do.
“It’s really unfortunate, as a mother of four boys and a grandmother, that I see more order in my home with children than I do with radical leftists,” Boebert said of the demonstrators. “We want to have a conversation. We want to be able to answer questions, but the tolerant left doesn’t seem very tolerant.”
Evans, noting that projected Medicaid spending would still see year-over-year increases under the GOP plan, at one point claimed flatly that “Medicaid is not being cut,” eliciting howls of derision from the protesters.
At nearly 10% of total projected spending, the bill’s $625 billion in total cuts to Medicaid spending over the next decade would be the largest reduction in the program’s 50-year history. Nationwide, a total of 10.3 million people would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Asked repeatedly how many of his constituents, nearly 1 in 3 of whom are enrolled in Medicaid, would become uninsured under the GOP plan, Evans did not answer, and instead twice recited the “categories of people who lose coverage.” Statewide, Colorado Medicaid enrollment would shrink by between 11% and 18%, according to KFF.
“Do you not know the number?” asked a reporter.
“I’m telling you the number right now,” said Evans, who did not say a number. “You may not like the answer, but that’s the answer. Next question.”
Republicans in the U.S. Senate are expected to pass their own budget reconciliation bill that differs significantly from the House’s version, a process that could extend well into the summer. Alongside the Medicaid cuts, other key components of the bill include extensions of broad-based income and business tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, and hundreds of billions of dollars in new funding for border security, law enforcement and the military.
Evans said claims that the bill amounted to “taking from the poor and giving to the rich” were “patently false.” But the benefits of the GOP plan’s tax cuts are heavily skewed towards people with higher incomes: The top 1% of earners would see their after-tax incomes rise by over 4%, while incomes for the bottom 20% of earners would rise by just 0.6%, or an average of $90 a year, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The nonpartisan CBO found those meager tax savings for low-income people would be more than offset by the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and other social programs, causing household resources for the lowest income decile to drop 4% by 2033 while rising for higher-income households.
“When you see your bill getting more and more unpopular as people learn the truth about it, you lie more,” said Wynn Howell, state director of the Colorado Working Families Party, after Thursday’s press conference. “When all you have is lies and scapegoats, you have a problem with your bill.”

The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust
voted 5-0 Thursday to file a lawsuit challenging House Bill 2783.
The measure, which became law Thursday without Gov. Kevin Stitt’s signature, requires the board appointees to serve at the will of the appointing entity and limits that service to seven years. The board members currently serve seven-year staggered terms. The seven members are appointed by the governor, treasurer, state superintendent, attorney general, state auditor and the leaders of the House and Senate and must have experience in health care or programs benefitting children or seniors.
Some Democrats believe the measure is legislative retaliation and an attempt to strip the board of its independence after TSET declined to immediately provide $50 million for a University of Oklahoma children’s pediatric heart hospital in Oklahoma City.
“What we are doing here is we are using legislative power to extract retaliation,” said Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, debating against the measure earlier this month.
Lawmakers put $200 million toward the project.
“These changes in statute appear to conflict with the Oklahoma Constitution, and the board needs clarity on this issue in order to protect the integrity of the TSET trust and ensure that any changes are consistent with the will of the voters who created TSET,” said Thomas Larson, the agency’s spokesperson.
Oklahoma voters created TSET, an endowment trust, in 2000 after 46 states sued tobacco companies. The tobacco companies paid states damages for illnesses caused by smoking.
TSET’s Board of Investors invests the funds. The earnings, which have grown to about $2 billion, are used to support efforts to improve health.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats and health care providers are warning of dire consequences for patients who rely on Medicaid for insurance coverage if the federal spending bill becomes law.
The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives by one vote last week and now sits in the U.S. Senate, where it could be largely rewritten. It could take most of the summer to shepherd a final version of the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk.
Colorado’s four Republican House members voted for the bill and the four Democrats in the delegation voted against it. The bill enacts much of Trump’s domestic policy agenda, including an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and Republicans argue it targets waste and fraud in government spending.

Some of the House-approved bill’s most sweeping provisions are changes to Medicaid, the nation’s health care program for low-income people that covers roughly 1 in 5 Americans. The changes include new work requirements for most people, more frequent eligibility checks and elimination of federal matching funds for some types of care, including gender-affirming care.
Those modifications would amount to about $700 billion in cuts over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
It would also mean fewer people enrolled and more cost-sharing for states, which are in charge of administering Medicaid programs. Democrats wrote in a letter to the state’s congressional delegation this week that Colorado’s hospitals, clinics and other providers could lose up to $990 million in annual federal Medicaid funding.
“The intent is to have people dis-enroll to save money in the short run. Make no mistake about it,” Dr. Steve Federico, the chief of government and community affairs at Denver Health, said during a virtual press conference on Thursday with legislative leaders and health care providers. “Ultimately, all health systems will see more patients who cannot afford to pay, thus seeing uncompensated care, which hurts all of us. These costs will stress health systems’ ability to care for patients, to provide needed appointments or to buy necessary medications or supplies. Hospitals and communities across Colorado will be at risk of decreasing services, decreasing access, or closing their doors all together.”
When hospitals provide uncompensated care, some of the costs ultimately get shifted to people with private insurance through higher premiums.










Ultimately, all health systems will see more patients who cannot afford to pay, thus seeing uncompensated care, which hurts all of us.


– Dr. Steve Federico, chief of government and community affairs at Denver Health


Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat who chairs the Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee, said an increase in administrative work could cost the state about $57 million and require thousands of new case managers. Lawmakers passed an ultra-tight budget this year that already required about $1 billion in cost-saving measures to absorb the cost of the state’s Medicaid program.
“(Republicans in Congress) talk about waste in government. This is $57 million that will be spent on admin and not health care. And this isn’t a huge problem — we’re not seeing $57 million worth of health care provided to people who don’t qualify,” he said.
Democratic lawmakers said the proposed Medicaid cuts could result in 11% to 18% of participants losing coverage.
That could include Veronica Montoya, a Denver resident who began relying on Medicaid after her chronic illnesses made it difficult to work. Her coverage has made it possible to get appropriate and effective care, she said.
“I’ll be on this medicine for the rest of my life, God willing, because it has helped. But if I lose this medicine, I don’t see a very good future,” she said. “I think about what these proposed cuts would do to me and I wonder how a silencer is more important than something that keeps me able to still function and have a life.”
The bill includes the elimination of a customer tax on firearm silencers.
The Colorado Legislature, which completed its regular 2025 session earlier this month, might need to reconvene for a special session if deep Medicaid cuts go through in order to find a solution that keeps the program functioning. House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said Thursday no decisions on a special session had been made yet.
“Obviously there’s a great deal of uncertainty at the moment. Whether or not a special session is in our future will depend on the impacts that ultimately are felt by the passage of the budget this year at the federal level,” she said. “So no decisions or determinations have been made on what our response will be — whether that is something that comes in a special session or next legislative session.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capitol Dispatch) As Gov. Kim Reynolds weighs which bills to sign into law from the 2025 legislative session, some organizations and local officials are asking the governor to reject certain measures approved by lawmakers.
The governor has until June 14 to sign into law bills passed during the 2025 session. If she does not sign or veto a measure, it is considered a “pocket veto” and is not enacted. Although there’s still a little over two weeks until the deadline, advocates are asking Reynolds to consider “pocket” or full vetos for several bills on her desk.
The highest profile bill receiving this post-session attention is House File 639, the bill relating to the use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects. Though the measure passed the Senate following a contentious debate, Reynolds has not said whether she plans to sign the bill into law. When asked about the measure on Iowa Press last week, Reynolds said her team and legal counsel are currently in the process of evaluating the bill.
She said she is hearing from people on both sides of the issue about how the legislation will impact Iowa. The bill will make multiple changes to regulations and requirements for the Iowa Utilities Commission, as well as allow more people to intervene in IUC proceedings. It also changes the definition of a “common carrier” in Iowa law and increases insurance requirements for property damage coverage and reimbursements for landowners who face higher premiums because of a pipeline on their property.
“I want to make sure that I have given individual stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in, so that I can, again, make the best-informed decision that I can, based on information I’ve heard,” Reynolds said.
While lawmakers in support of the measure and landowners who have called for more restrictions on the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines — particularly related to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project — opponents to the bill said the language in the bill is too broad and could create legal problems for people who have already signed easement contracts if a project like Summit cannot be completed.
This is not the only bill for which organizations are seeking further consideration:
Reimbursements for 911 services
The governor has the ability to line-item veto certain elements within budget bills — a step some public safety advocates are asking for with regard to Senate File 659, this year’s standings appropriations bill.
The legislation is largely a budget bill dealing with various state spending obligations, but it also includes several policy components that were not passed as standalone measures during the legislative session. One of the policies including in this year’s standings bill relates to costs from local 911 service boards.
The measure would allow the Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEMD) to request reimbursement for “reasonable costs” from local 911 service boards related to the delivery of 911 call traffic to public safety answering points, or PSAPs.
Two organizations, the Iowa Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials and the state’s National Emergency Number Association, have asked for Reynolds to veto this element of the bill, arguing it could add significant costs to local first responders that would impact their ability to perform public safety duties for Iowa communities.
Chris Jasper, president of the Iowa National Emergency Number Association, said the bill’s language is “so broad” that it is difficult to tell the actual fiscal impact the measure would have on local 911 service boards. There is not a definition included in the legislation on what constitutes “reasonable costs,” and there are not specifications on dollar amounts or how often local boards can be billed by the state under the provision. Jasper said his organization has requested clarification from the state on these questions but has not received answers.
Though there are no financial estimates yet, funding coming from local first responders to the Iowa HSEMD would have to be compensated for through “cut services, potentially cut staffing, or we would have to make up for that in raising taxes,” Jasper said.
“HSEMD sends a bill for $50,000 to a county to cover their expenses, that’s $50,000 less that they have to use to purchase radio equipment for their public safety entities or to work on a project,” Jasper said. “So they would either have to scrap that project, scrap purchasing new equipment, scrap updating their equipment, or they would have to take that $50,000 and get it from a tax increase.”
Reynolds said on Iowa Press her staff is currently working on evaluating the legislation. Her office has received multiple letters and requests to veto the measure, she said, but she noted that many 911 service boards have money that is currently unspent.
“It’s a critical system,” Reynolds said. “We want to make sure that we sustain it. It’s really important to keep Iowans safe. A component of this also is that they are sitting on a $66 million surplus. So, we have to take all of that into account and make sure we understand what their concerns are, what Homeland is looking at, and find a compromise that works for everyone, but most importantly that keeps that system sustainable and make sure that we are taking into account the safety of Iowans.”
Jasper disputed Reynolds’ characterization that the money was a “surplus.” The figure of more than $60 million is divided between Iowa’s 99 counties, and many of the projects these county boards are taking on cost millions of dollars, he said, that require savings to pursue.
“When we’re talking about equipment, you know, a (computer-aided dispatch) system is a million dollars plus,” Jasper said. “We just did a radio project here in Muscatine County that was $3.9 million — I know Scott County just did one that was $8 million. And so when you think of these counties having $600,000 in the bank, they’re doing exactly what they should be doing in their planning and accounting for projects, and saving that money to cover those costs. And so it may give this perception that we’re sitting on a surplus of money, but when you break it down, we’re really not.”
Pharmacy benefit managers
Pharmacists and health care advocates have called for Reynolds to sign Senate File 383, a bill setting new regulations and requirements on pharmacy benefit managers, the entities negotiating prescription drug prices between pharmacies, drug manufacturers and insurance providers.
The legislation would make multiple changes aimed at restricting certain PBM business practices that supporters of the bill say hurt rural pharmacists, like providing financial incentives or penalties for the use of mail-order or certain pharmacies to fill prescriptions. The measure also requires PBMs reimburse prescription drug costs at the national or Iowa average acquisition cost — a higher rate than some pharmacists say they currently receive — and sets a dispensing fee of $10.68 from PBMs to pharmacists for each prescription filled at rural and small pharmacies.
In a letter to Reynolds Wednesday, a group of health care organizations and advocates including the Iowa Pharmacy Association, Iowa Association of Rural Health Clinics and Bleeding Disorders of the Heartland, urged the governor to sign the bill, saying it will help pharmacies in rural Iowa stay in business.
Kate Gainer, executive vice president and CEO of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, said in a statement the measure is needed to support Iowa health care providers across the state by addressing PBM practices “that drive up costs and limit patient choice.”
“It is this imperative that has brought many of Iowa’s top healthcare organizations and rural community advocates together to support the signing of SF 383 into law,” Gainer said in a statement. “Iowa patients can’t afford to wait any longer.”
Pharmacists and advocates in support of the bill have said PBM practices have contributed to the closure more than 200 pharmacies across Iowa, including 31 pharmacies that closed in 2024.
But some business and insurance entities have said the bill will increase health care costs for Iowans. In a statement on the bill as it went through the legislature, organizations including the Iowa Association of Business and Industry (ABI) and Iowa Business Council said the legislation would increase health care costs for both businesses and individuals. A release from ABI said the bill would add an estimated $340 million in costs to private-sector health plans statewide in addition to raising costs by roughly $169 per insured Iowan each year.
Joe Murphy, president of the Iowa Business Council, said in a statement the measure “will substantially increase costs for Iowa businesses and their employees” during a period of economic uncertainty.
“At a time when inflationary pressures from tariffs and other economic headwinds are bearing down on our state, we cannot afford to add further cost burdens through legislative action,” Murphy said. “We remain committed to a thoughtful, targeted approach to PBM reform—one that supports small, independent pharmacies serving Iowa.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8587-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 19:05:33.281004

Courtesy photoAs courts continue to weigh the fate of the Trump Administration’s tariff policy, a Burlington-based women’s cycling apparel company stands at the center of the ongoing legal squabble, along with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.Terry Precision Cycling, or Terry Cycling, was one of five small businesses that sued President Donald Trump and his administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in April. The lawsuit prompted a ruling from a panel of three federal judges that struck down most of the president’s tariffs on Wednesday. Nik Holm, president of Terry Cycling, said that the Vermont company decided to fight against the administration’s trade policy after recognizing that the tariffs were “an existential threat,” to its business.“We’re a company that reacts. We’re a direct to consumer company, so we kind of see changes pretty quickly and respond to them,” Holm said. “We raised our hand.” The small business lawsuit dovetailed with a separate complaint filed in the same court also last month by Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark and the attorneys general of 11 other states. READ MORE
Both suits argue that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when, in a series of executive orders this year, he invoked emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods from almost all countries.Wednesday’s ruling, which applies to both cases jointly, favored that argument, blocking most of the administration’s tariffs, including those that the president declared on goods from Canada and Mexico earlier this year. The Trump Administration has already appealed the decision, asking an appellate court to block the injunction against the tariffs. Late Thursday afternoon, the court complied, temporarily pausing enforcement of Wednesday’s ruling. According to Holm, Terry Cycling was one of two companies in the case that convincingly demonstrated it had been harmed by the Trump Administration’s tariffs, making it instrumental in Wednesday’s decision and the ongoing legal dispute.The company was founded in upstate New York almost half a century ago and sells women’s cycling gear and apparel, from helmets and saddles to shorts and tops. In 2009, the company relocated to Vermont when former Vermont Teddy Bear CEO Liz Robert purchased a majority stake. Since then, the business has been acquired by the Flagg Cycling Group, a family of cycling-oriented companies — though Terry Cycling has remained in the Queen City.According to the complaint, the company imports finished goods from China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Italy and the Philippines and sources fabrics and other materials from several other countries, the complaint said.As a result of the tariffs, the company had already paid an additional $25,000 by mid April and was projecting the cost to climb to $250,000 by the end of the year. For 2026, the suit says, the company would be paying about $1.2 million in levies. “We saw this as a big existential threat,” Holm said.Terry Cycling is far from alone. Companies in Vermont and across the country have sounded alarms about the impacts of the tariffs — and their spastic rollout — have had on business. “This is a huge victory,” said Attorney General Clark in an interview. “The tariffs have had a significant impact on the economy in this country, on the sense of predictability for businesses, and our stock market, so I’m proud to have been a part of the coalition to have brought this lawsuit in the first place.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  A federal court ruled against Trump’s tariffs in two lawsuits.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)MIAMI — A federal judge locked horns repeatedly with the prominent lawyer defending Attorney General James Uthmeier during a hearing Thursday on potential sanctions against the state’s top legal officer amid a suit over a new state immigration law.
U.S. Judge Kathleen Williams stated multiple times that Uthmeier was not above the law and that he had to abide by the court’s orders. But Uthmeier may emerge from the legal quarrel relatively unscathed despite drawing Williams’ ire for calling illegitimate and unlawful her order temporarily blocking the immigration law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
Although it would be extraordinary for a judge to hold a Florida attorney general in contempt, the sanctions discussed during the hearing included having Uthmeier issue another directive, which she offered to write, to law enforcement clarifying that they can’t enforce a law making it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
“There needs to be an appreciation and abiding by court order, or else this all becomes anarchy,” Williams said.
Uthmeier didn’t attend the hearing.
Redress for wrongful arrests
Plaintiffs’ attorneys — from the ACLU Foundation of Florida, ACLU Foundation Immigrants’ Rights Project, Americans For Immigrant Justice, and Community Justice Project — also want the judge to make the state pay their fees and establish a way to provide legal help for anyone who may have been arrested under the state law after April 18.
The groups filed the suit on behalf of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status.
Feds blame U.S. citizen for his arrest under suspended immigration law

An investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that law enforcement arrested 25 people after Williams first blocked the law on April 4, but didn’t find any arrests after April 18, when Williams ordered Uthmeier to notify law enforcement about her order. Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen from Georgia, was one of those arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper. The 20-year-old’s arrest, first reported by Florida Phoenix, garnered international attention.
Uthmeier’s letter could lead to sanctions
At the heart of the hearing was a letter Uthmeier sent to law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs on April 23, stating that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under SB 4C, and that, in his view, “no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Florida’s new illegal entry and reentry laws.”
The April 23 letter came after another that Uthmeier had sent five days earlier, following Williams’ order, stating that no arrests should take place.
Uthmeier brought in Jesse Panuccio, who’d been acting U.S. associate attorney general for parts of President Donald Trump’s first term, to represent him on Thursday. Panuccio got into heated back-and-forths with Williams over what he called an unfair interpretation of the letter that took it out of context.
Panuccio, whom Uthmeier had named co-chairman of his transition team following his appointment as AG three months ago, scolded the judge for bringing up comments Uthmeier made in interviews and for talking about his social media posts.
“You invited me to consider context, and I am considering context,” Williams said to Panuccio.
Elected or appointed officials, such as Uthmeier, shouldn’t be policed over the comments they make in public as part of their job, Panuccio said. Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Uthmeier, his then-chief of staff, to the top legal spot in the state in February.
“They do engage in puffery that has been part of our politics since the dawn of the republic,” Panuccio said.
Continued oversight on arrests
The judge is also contemplating requiring the defendants to submit weekly or monthly reports on arrests under the suspended law. The lack of reported arrests pointed to a consensus that Uthmeier’s letter didn’t violate the court order, Panuccio said.
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, told the judge that the lack of arrests didn’t exempt Uthmeier from the consequences of disobeying her order.
“It’s not because of the attorney general’s conduct, it’s in spite of it,” Wofsy said.
Leading up to the hearing, Uthmeier said during an interview that aired on Newsmax on May 6 that he wouldn’t rubber stamp her order.
Williams brought up that interview when she said she could write another letter and make Uthmeier send it to law enforcement groups.
“He need have no qualm about it being authorized by him,” she said.
Uthemeier and the other defendants — the statewide prosecutor and state’s attorneys — have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Williams’ injunction barring enforcement of the law.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill that would require gun owners to keep any firearms in a locked box whenever a minor is present will soon head to Gov. JB Pritzker.

Senate Bill 8, also referred to as the Safe Gun Storage Act, is the latest gun safety measure pushed by Democrats in the General Assembly. It passed the House 69-40, with Republican lawmakers warning that it could be found unconstitutional if challenged in court.

The bill mandates that gun owners store their firearms in a secure, locked box in any place where they know or “reasonably should know” that a minor without permission to access a firearm, an at-risk person or someone who is prohibited from obtaining a firearm can access the weapon. Gun owners who violate the act would be subject to civil penalties.

The law would apply to both handguns and long guns, such as rifles and shotguns.

Under the state’s current criminal code, firearm owners are required to store their guns in a place that’s inaccessible to a child under the age of 14 – SB8 raises the age requirement to a child under 18 and mandates that the gun must be locked away or equipped with a device making it temporarily inoperable.

It also defines an at-risk person as someone who has shown behavior or made statements that a “reasonable person” would consider indicative that the individual may physically harm themselves or others.

“An estimated 30 million children in our country live in a home with at least one firearm, with 4.6 million children living in homes with unlocked and loaded guns,” bill sponsor in the House, Rep. Maura Hirschauer, D-Batavia, said during floor debate. “We are all familiar with the chilling statistics that guns are the No. 1 cause of death for our children in the United States.”

The bill exempts firearms carried on a person who has a concealed carry license. The gun owner also would not be liable if a minor, at-risk or prohibited person uses the firearm in self-defense or uses it after accessing it illegally – for instance, in circumstances like breaking and entering.

The Safe Gun Storage Act also makes changes to a variety of existing Illinois gun laws, including a mandate that firearm owners report a lost or stolen firearm within 48 hours of the owner finding the firearm missing, instead of the current 72-hour timeframe. Illinois State Police would also be given the ability to revoke a firearm owner’s identification, or FOID, card if a gun owner fails to report a stolen or lost firearm twice or more under the bill.

If a minor, at-risk or prohibited person gains access to an unlocked firearm, the bill provides the gun owner could face civil penalties ranging from $500 to $10,000 if the gun to hurt or kill another person in a crime.

A separate section of the bill allows for a $1,000 fine and a Class C misdemeanor charge against a gun owner if a minor under the age of 18 causes death or bodily harm while accessing a firearm without permission. That language previously only applied to minors under the age of 14.

“Safe firearms storage and responsible gun ownership are practices on which all of us in this room, gun owners and non-gun owners alike, can agree,” Hirschauer said. “Safe gun storage can reduce unintentional injuries, suicides and intentional harm, like school shootings, by stopping unauthorized access.”

Under SB8, if a firearm owner fails to store their firearm in a secure, locked box and a minor, at-risk or prohibited person illegally obtains the firearm and uses it to hurt themselves or others – the owner could be charged with negligence.

The Safe Gun Storage Act also requires Illinois State Police to expand an online database that was required under a previous law to house all information on the make, model and serial number of reported lost or stolen firearms. By Jan. 1, 2027, ISP would have to make the portal accessible to licensed firearm dealers, who would be required to cross-reference the database to ensure any firearms they are selling or transferring are not a firearm listed in the database.

Another aspect of the bill classifies anyone traveling through the state with a firearm that’s prohibited under state law as gun trafficking – a felony charge that can result in up to a 15-year prison sentence.

Arguments of unconstitutionality

During debate about the bill on the Senate floor in April, Sen. Neil Anderson, R-Andalusia, took issue with the bill giving Illinois State Police the ability to revoke a person’s FOID card.

He said that aspect of the bill would not pass the Rahimi test – referencing the 2023 United States v. Rahimi Supreme Court case, which ruled a court can temporarily revoke a perron's firearm rights if the court determines the firearm owner is a threat to public safety when in possession of a firearm.

SB8 would allow Illinois State Police to revoke a person’s FOID card, which Anderson said is in direct conflict with the Rahimi decision – which said only courts had the power to revoke a person's firearm rights.

Bill sponsor Sen. Laura Ellman, D-Naperville, disagreed with Anderson, saying the Rahimi case did not exclude law enforcement from being able to revoke a person’s FOID card. The bill passed the Senate on a vote of 33-19.

A similar debate happened on the House floor Wednesday before the bill’s eventual passage.

Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, took issue with the bill’s creation of a potential negligence charge for gun owners who do not safely secure a gun that’s used by a minor, at-risk or prohibited person to harm someone. He said he believed such a burden shift to be unconstitutional.

Hirschauer responded that the burden shift only applies when the reasonable standard is met – when it’s reasonably found that the gun owner should have known to safely store their firearm – or, if “some terrible negligence” occurs.

Windhorst also raised concerns about the fact that cable locks, which are locked cables inserted through a firearm’s chamber and out of the magazine well, are not considered “safe storage” under the bill. Under existing law about storing guns away from minors, a cable lock is considered safe storage of a firearm. Windhorst said that conflicts with the new language pertaining to gun storage, which does not mention devices that render a gun temporarily inoperable.

“Under the criminal code of this bill where we are changing our current child access protection law, a cable lock would suffice,” Hirschauer said. “Under the new Safe Storage Act, it would not.”

He also argued that the bill impeded the rights of concealed carry license holders who carry a gun in a vehicle, as some firearms owners currently store their gun in the center console or glove box. Under the Safe Gun Storage Act, the center console or glove box would have to be lockable in order to render the firearm safely stored.

Windhorst also voiced concerns that the gun trafficking charges in the bill could be brought against a person passing through Illinois with firearms in their vehicle that are legal in their home state – a point which Hirschauer responded to by reading language in the bill that expressly excluded non-residents from the charges.

“If someone is a non-resident of Illinois and is passing through and they are a legal gun owner in the state in which they reside, if that state doesn't have a FOID card system and if they are authorized under federal law to own a gun, then they would not be subject to this,” she said.

Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, raised concerns about the bill’s definition of “lawful permission” and its limitations on minors who hunt.  The bill requires firearm owners to safely secure their firearm in a locked box when around a minor who does not have “lawful permission” from a parent or guardian to access a firearm. On the House floor, Davidsmeyer asked what constitutes “lawful permission,” to which Hirschauer answered it, “could be several things.”

When asked whether permission must be written down or notarized for parental permission of a minor using a firearm to hunt to be considered lawful, Hirschauer answered that “hypothetical points are fact dependent.” Davidsmeyer said the question was not a hypothetical, and that it is an issue that will crop up in “daily life” for minors who hunt.

“This bill, I believe, violates recent Supreme Court decisions under the Second Amendment and will likely be found unconstitutional,” Windhorst said at the end of debate.

Hirschauer disagreed.

“Firearm theft compromises the effectiveness of our commonsense gun laws and often results in these weapons being acquired by people who are legally prohibited from possessing them,” she said. “The reporting measures strengthened in this bill will give law enforcement the tools they need to crack down on lost and stolen guns.”

Opponents to SB8 include the ACLU of Illinois, Illinois State Rifle Association and the Illinois State Crime Commissions; the Illinois State Police did not officially oppose or support the bill. SB8 passed the Senate 33-19 last month and awaits approval from the governor before it can become law.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Activist Jimbo Gillcrist helped volunteers hand out flyers on basic legal rights to people headed into immigration court until security guards ordered the group to exit an office-building lobby for allegedly solicitating visitors.
“I’m not asking for anything. I’m not selling anything,” said Gillcrist, a former theology teacher inspired to work on immigrant rights issues. “They responded by saying, ‘Well, it’s private property.’ They told me if I didn’t leave right then, that they’d call the police. We were outside the building, and they came out there and told us to get completely off the property.”
Gillcrist asked immigration attorney Angela Ferguson to advocate for the ousted volunteers Wednesday as security staff moved to lock entrance doors and limit access to elevators used to reach immigration courtrooms in the building on Grand Boulevard. Initially, Ferguson wasn’t permitted to enter the public courtroom.
“If they can do this to me, and lock me out of my livelihood, what are they doing to people that they say have no rights?” Ferguson said.
Judge Jayme Salinardi, one of several immigration judges hearing cases in Kansas City, descended from the fifth floor to intervene in the standoff so observers could regain courtroom access.
Supporters of an immigrant rights organization had protested Tuesday in Washington Square Park across the street from the court. Three immigrants were detained last week by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after appearing for immigration court appointments in Kansas City, Ferguson said.
The intimidating tactic of ICE agents served to encourage immigrants to skip court hearings, she said.
“They cannot pursue their right to protection, their right to asylum or they can’t have a chance to get legal if they don’t show up for court,” she said. “We want people to come to court and pursue what rights they do have. This is just the wrong way to go about it.”
 
Expedited removal
On Thursday, Ferguson and Gillcrist returned to the immigration court building to resume sharing information on defendant rights. They did so outside the fifth-floor courtroom but with greater discretion by shrinking a green one-page document to a narrow strip of paper easily passed from person to person.
Ian Tomasic, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security attorney, asked the judge to dismiss a handful of cases pending against people who were present to fight their removal and set the stage for expedited deportation of those individuals.
Salinardi declined to accept oral motions from Tomasic and ruled each had to be submitted in writing by government lawyers.
The judge cautioned targeted immigrants, who resided in Dodge City, Kansas, St. Joseph, Missouri, and Wichita, Kansas, they each had a maximum of 10 days to respond to a motion after it was filed. Failure of a defendant to answer in a timely way could be viewed as abandonment of the case and open the door to swift departure from the United States, he said.
“If you fail to appear at any immigration court hearing, you’ll be ordered deported in your absence,” the judge said.
Salinardi repeated general advice to immigrants appearing in his court: “I recommend you find an attorney immediately.” He urged immigrants to confirm authenticity of people portraying themselves as lawyers because con artists were a plague on the immigration system. “Every week, I have people who are taken advantage of and I don’t want that to happen,” the judge said.
 
‘Getting blindsided’
Immigration attorney Megan Galicia, who works for a private law firm and spent the morning observing the Kansas City immigration court proceedings, said Salinardi’s preference for written motions was useful to immigrants who continued to press asylum claims. If he had considered accepting the oral motions from Tomasic, she said, defendants representing themselves wouldn’t have been prepared to respond.
“He wants everything in writing, which is very consistent with the way he manages his dockets,” Galicia said. “I’m very pleased to see this because this puts people in the best possible position to be able to fight this. What we’ve heard across the country is that people are really just getting blindsided when they walk into court.”
Galicia said most individuals counseled by the judge to hire an attorney wouldn’t be able to secure legal representation. The Kansas City area, she said, had an insufficient supply of nonprofit legal organizations or attorneys willing to represent immigrant clients. In immigration cases, the federal government doesn’t provide public defenders.
On this day, the judge did offer a briefing on immigration court. His attentive audience sat on church-like pews in the small courtroom and had benefit of an interpreter’s Spanish translation of the judge’s remarks.
“You are before the court because you have violated immigration laws of the United States,” Salinardi said. “In your case, the court will set deadlines. If you miss those deadlines, you’ll lose the chance to file applications or evidence.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Angela-Ferguson-and-Jimbo-Gillcrist-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-29 19:05:33.281004

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A last-minute bill filed on behalf of the state’s sole casino operator cleared a Rhode Island Senate committee hearing after roughly 10 minutes Wednesday, despite strong objections from the Rhode Island Lottery. Now it’s set to sprint toward a floor vote in the full chamber on Tuesday.
The bill introduced on May 23 by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, would increase the cap for reimbursements Bally’s Corp. receives from the Rhode Island Lottery for its marketing costs. But the legislation really serves as a contingency plan should lawmakers push forward legislation to ban smoking at the company’s Lincoln and Tiverton properties.
Ciccone confirmed that he introduced the legislation at the request of Bally’s as a way to make up for anticipated lost revenue if a smoking ban is enacted this year. For years, unionized workers, public health advocates and progressive lawmakers have pushed to end the loophole that exempts Bally’s casinos from an indoor smoking ban. 
Bally’s Twin River in Lincoln and Bally’s Tiverton Casino & Hotel allow patrons to smoke while casinos in Massachusetts and Connecticut are smoke-free. Bally’s projects it could lose $20 million annually if smoking were fully banned at the Lincoln and Tiverton casinos, said the company’s spokesperson Patti Doyle.
“As we look to the possibility of the smoking ban being enacted, we need as many tools in our arsenal as possible to bring back any lost revenue to the state,” Doyle said.
Ciccone has long opposed banning smoking at the two casinos, saying he believed it would mean lost revenue.
“I just feel that the people who are here are because they can smoke and gamble — it’s as simple as that,” Ciccone said in an interview. “If that closes, you’re going to lose a small percentage of them.”
The Rhode Island Lottery is responsible for reimbursing Bally’s under different rate structures — one for the Lincoln facility and one for the Tiverton casino. Both casinos have been regulated under two-tiered rates since 2010, when Tiverton’s license was still held by Newport Grand under different ownership.
In Lincoln, the state reimburses 60.7% of all casino marketing expenditures between $4 million and $10 million. The state pays nothing for Bally’s marketing expenditures over $10 million up to $14 million, then reimburses 60.7% of expenditures between $14 million and $17 million. 
In Tiverton, the state reimburses 60.1% of marketing expenditures between $560,000 and $1.4 million. Doyle said the Tiverton casino was capped at the lower end because its contract was tied to the now-defunct, smaller Newport Grand tier structure.
During the fiscal year ending on June 30, Rhode Island Lottery projects Bally’s Lincoln will be reimbursed a total of $3,640,800 for marketing expenditures, while Bally’s Tiverton will be reimbursed a total of $506,890, said lottery spokesperson Paul Grimaldi. 
But if Ciccone’s bill becomes law, Grimaldi said, Bally’s Lincoln would have been reimbursed $6,068,000 and the Tiverton casino would have been reimbursed $844,816  — representing a nearly $2.8 million increase.
Lottery Director Mark Furcolo’s interpretation of the legislation is that the state would have to reimburse Bally’s at a rate of approximately 60.5% up to a cap of $27.25 million. 
“Should Bally’s spend more than it has during the last three fiscal years, there would be a greater impact to the state,” Furcolo wrote to the committee.










As we look to the possibility of the smoking ban being enacted, we need as many tools in our arsenal as possible to bring back any lost revenue to the state.


Furcolo said he was not opposed to the idea of consolidating Bally’s marketing program from an administrative standpoint, but he doesn’t believe the state should be on the hook for additional reimbursement.
He added that amending any new contract would require a “time-consuming legal undertaking” and could conflict with the Lottery’s plans to issue a request for information on potentially expanding the number of online sports betting apps available in the state.
Despite Furculo’s opposition, the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming voted 6-0 to advance Ciccone’s bill at its initial hearing Wednesday. Not present were Democrats Ryan Pearson of Cumberland, Ana Quezada of Providence, and Brian Thompson of Woonsocket. Ciccone joined the panel in his ex-officio role as majority leader.
Ciccone’s bill is scheduled to be voted by the full Senate on Tuesday, chamber spokesperson Greg Paré said in an email Thursday. Companion legislation has not been introduced in the House.
Momentum to make casinos smoke-free has grown in the House, where Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is one of 10 cosponsors listed on the latest edition of a bill sponsored by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat. The House Committee on Finance held an initial hearing on Tanzi’s bill on April 10, when it was held for further study — as is standard practice for a first look by a legislative panel.Companion legislation introduced by Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski in February has yet to be heard by the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming. No hearing date has been set.
Newly-elected Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has stated she personally supports a smoking ban, but indicated she would like to see the standard committee review process play out.
The growing support in the House mirrors overall sentiment in Rhode Island. The AFL-CIO in February released a poll that found nearly seven in 10 survey respondents “strongly” or “somewhat” supported a smoking ban at the state’s two casinos.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Two federal lawsuits filed Thursday argue that a new state law will harm hundreds of thousands of Arkansans by affecting access to needed medications.
Two of the country’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) filed the complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, both arguing that Act 624 of 2025 violates the U.S. Constitution by interfering with interstate commerce. The suits also allege that federal law preempts state laws that affect employee health plans and Medicare coverage.
The suits filed by Express Scripts Inc. and CVS Pharmacy Inc. name the eight members of the Arkansas State Board of Pharmacy and its executive director as defendants. The new law empowers the pharmacy board to enforce its provisions.
Both complaints ask the court to bar enforcement of the law as well as declare it unconstitutional.
Act 624 “imperils the health” of 50,000 Arkansans who rely on Express Scripts for pharmacy benefits through their health insurance, the PBM’s complaint says.
The General Assembly created the law “for the exclusive benefit of Arkansas-based pharmacies who spearheaded the legislation in order to increase their market share by eliminating out-of-state competition,” the complaint states.
Health insurer Cigna owns Express Scripts; CVS Pharmacy owns the PBM Caremark Rx. Together with OptumRx, owned by United Healthcare, the PBMs manage 79% of prescription drug claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.
Arkansas became the first state in the nation to ban large, vertically integrated healthcare companies from also operating drugstores in the state when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 into law in mid-April. The law doesn’t take effect until January 2026.
“If left to stand, the law will have devastating consequences across Arkansas — including forcing numerous pharmacies operating in the state out of business, costing the more than 600 Arkansans employed at those pharmacies their jobs, and creating pharmacy ‘deserts’ for the nearly 40% of Arkansans who live in rural areas that often lack brick-and-mortar pharmacies,” Express Scripts asserts in its complaint.
“The law will also dangerously limit patient choice and deny access to lifesaving drugs at affordable prices by high-quality pharmacy providers. And it will create mass confusion among Arkansans about where and how they can receive needed prescription medications,” the suit adds.

In its complaint, CVS says that if the law takes effect on Jan. 1, the company “will have to cease not only its operations at 23 CVS retail pharmacies across the State, but also its mail-order and specialty-pharmacy services. Indeed, the law will likely shut down a substantial portion of all mail-order and specialty-pharmacy prescriptions flowing into the State because the majority of such providers are out-of-state pharmacies with PBM affiliations.”
The complaint notes that CVS’s 23 pharmacies served more than 340,000 patients and filled over 2.4 million prescriptions in 2024.
Complying with the law will impose undue burdens on CVS because of the intricacies of its corporate structure, the complaint says. CVS further claims the law already has begun affecting its business, as it has lost patients to in-state competitors and it’s become harder to attract and retain employees in Arkansas.
The CVS complaint calls Act 624 “a blatantly protectionist measure,” a characterization echoed in Express Script’s argument for a court-ordered injunction:  “Because Act 624 is unconstitutionally protectionist, unconstitutionally punitive, and preempted by federal law, enforcement of the statute must be enjoined.”
Both lawsuits argue that the Arkansas law violates various commerce provisions of the Constitution, and CVS argues that it violates the equal protection clause by banning CVS and most other PBM-affiliated pharmacies from Arkansas while exempting “the only Arkansas-based pharmacy affiliated with a PBM [Walmart], without a rational justification for this distinction.”
Express Script’s complaint also notes that Act 624 will adversely affect members of the military, their families and veterans because the PBM is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program. 
The law allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Republican Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton, the law’s co-sponsor, told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.
Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement that “Arkansas is standing up to PBMs on behalf of consumers” via Act 624 and vowed to defend the law.
“Pharmacy benefit managers wield outsized power to reap massive profits at the expense of consumers. The rise of PBMs as middlemen in the prescription drug market has resulted in patients facing fewer choices, lower quality care, and higher prices. PBMs leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition,” Griffin said, echoing many of the talking points of the law’s proponents as it made its way through the Legislature. 
Shortly before Act 624 became law, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in Act 624 to be enacted federally.

To resolve the case, Houck Pharmacy has agreed to pay a $500 civil penalty and have its pharmacy license placed on probation for 12 months.
In a related matter, Hillary Lee Lunning of Mason City was charged by the board with incorrectly compounding a medication resulting in an overdose to a minor patient.
The available board documents give no indication as to where or when the alleged violation occurred, but corporate records indicate Lunning is the president of Houck Drug Co., which operates Houck Pharmacy.
Lunning has agreed to pay a $500 civil penalty and have her license placed on probation for one year.



Pharmacist agrees to halt practice
A central Iowa pharmacist has agreed to refrain from practicing in Iowa.
According to the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, Jeffrey Bates of Indianola has agreed to refrain from practicing any aspect of pharmacy in Iowa in order to “meet the board’s interest in protecting the public.”
The publicly available board documents provide no information as to what led to the agreement but stipulates that Bates is “unable to practice” due to an administrative regulation that relates to pharmacists “diverting prescription drugs from a pharmacy for personal use or for distribution.”
Although the board has not disclosed where Bates worked at the time of the alleged regulatory violation, his National Provider Identifier records indicate he has worked at the Hy-Vee pharmacy at 910 N. Jefferson Way in Indianola.

The assessment of Michigan’s voter protections came during a virtual press call hosted by the national branch of Common Cause, which featured updates on legislative voting rights attacks in Florida, North Carolina, Michigan and Texas.
Quentin Turner, executive director of Common Cause Michigan, said the fundamental right to vote in Michigan is mostly secure thanks to constitutional protections passed by voters in recent years. Those protections, however, could be at risk with House Republicans pushing for a constitutional amendment requiring proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.
If the effort prevails and a potential voter cannot produce those documents, they would be denied registration in the state. Turner said House Joint Resolution B, put forward by Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford), was one legislative avenue Republicans used to try and institute the change.
  On May 1, 2025, State Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) testified in support of his House Joint Resolution B, which aims to amend the state constitution to require proof of citizenship for voters. | Kyle Davidson
Turner said Posthumus’ resolution was “an attempt at Scooby-Doo level villainy.”
“It wears the mask of election security, but when you pull it off, you see it’s been voter suppression the whole time,” Turner said.
The measure needed a two-thirds majority vote of the House to pass, but it failed to meet that threshold when it came to the House floor earlier this month, with Republicans only able to muster a simple majority.
The measure is pretty much dead in the water legislatively, Turner said, but the threat has not passed. Two approved ballot measures mirror the resolution and its requirement for proof of citizenship to register to vote, and the groups behind them could start collecting signatures soon.
“[The resolution and the ballot measures] would cause several problems for current and future eligible voters, including additional red tape, additional financial burden, delays, confusion within clerks’ offices and [voters] potentially being removed from voter rolls with minimal warning,” Turner said. “It would block access to the ballot for millions of Michiganders who lack the right documents to comply, but are American citizens eligible to vote, nonetheless.”
The effort would cut across wide swaths of the voting public here in Michigan, but would be especially harmful to rural voters, voters who’ve changed their name from their birth name for any reason, student voters, Black and brown voters and elderly voters, Turner said.
Common Cause Michigan mobilized hundreds of its members to urge representatives against Posthumus’ resolution when it was moving through the House. That included an email writing campaign directed at legislators on both sides of the political aisle.
The same effort would be put toward educating citizens on the ballot measures, Turner said.
“Just like we did with [the resolution], Common Cause Michigan is going to educate, organize and mobilize Michiganders so we can take the mask off these two-faced ballot measures and hinder efforts from those who attack our fundamental right to vote,” Turner said.
Turner was asked about the Michigan Department of State’s recent report on the number of non-citizens who were found to have voted illegally in 2024, which totaled 16 individuals. The department has since referred 13 of those cases to the Michigan Department of Attorney General for possible criminal charges.

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said then that the issue was serious but one that needed to be addressed “with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” referring to Posthumus’ resolution and the efforts to put proof of citizenship on the ballot.
A reporter asked Turner what a scalpel approach would look like as opposed to the alleged sledgehammer proposed by Republicans.
Although Turner did not give a clear example, he said he agreed with Benson’s assessment.
“If you’re trying to put a nail into your wall, you don’t take a sledgehammer to it and destroy the wall. And this is exactly what this type of policy is doing,” Turner said. “This is an overreaction that would put millions of legal Michigan votes in jeopardy. And I think we’ve shown time and time again, over many, many years, that elections in Michigan are free, fair and safe, and there is no exceptional voter fraud that’s happening in the state. And this legislation is attempting to continue this narrative that just doesn’t exist in Michigan.”
In response, Posthumus told Michigan Advance that the characterization of his resolution and the ballot measures was “ridiculous,” and that he believed 85% of the state’s population agreed that only U.S. citizens should vote in Michigan elections. That includes support for a requirement for presenting photo identification when appearing at a polling place to cast a ballot.
“This is absolutely a no-brainer,” Posthumus said.
Although his resolution failed when it came up for a vote on the House floor, Posthumus said the caucus left open the option to bring it back. Whether that occurs is still an open question, but Pothumus said a legislatively-approved constitutional amendment would have to go before the voters, either way, and that there was more than one way to get there.
As to the idea that non-citizens voting in Michigan elections was not a major issue for the state, Posthumus said the story keeps changing when convenient for the Michigan Department of State.
“A year ago, our secretary of state said that there’s no evidence that any non-citizens voted in our elections. Then, in October, it was, ‘OK, but it’s only one [non-citizen] voting in our election,’” Posthumus said. “Now it’s 16. The fact of the matter is, we still don’t know that [total number], and there is no mechanism by which we can know with any certainty how many non-citizens are voting in our elections.”
Posthumus said that was besides the point because the 2000 presidential election was decided by just over 500 votes and, more recently, a Michigan House election was decided by less than 20 votes.
“Every single legal vote matters, and every single illegal vote shouldn’t be counted,” he said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Businessman and Utah Senate President Stuart Adams recently reminded America’s other 49 states that “Utah is the greatest state in the nation” due to its high ratings in “management, the economy, and happiness.”
Not only that, but the “Rising Utah” project plans to grow Utah economically from being the current “Crossroads of the West” (the title of which was already claimed by Indiana) to being the “Crossroads of the World” just in time for the 2034 Winter Olympics games here.
In his annual State of the State speech in 2024, Gov. Spencer Cox adopted a modernist Tower of Babel orientation. He said, “Now is a time for building,” and “We’re not done doing big things. And we’re not done building.” The key to Utah success is not education, apparently, but building: “For 180 years and counting, Utahns have been building our way out of problems, even when things looked impossible.” In another nod to Utah’s greatness, he said, “Our home has become the envy of the earth.”
However, Utah’s young people, like elsewhere in the country, don’t know much about how to work, having never seen or experienced a family farm in their lives. Nor do many high school graduates even want to work. Many are depressed and anxious and addicted to screen time. Wages are low; banks charge incredibly high interest rates on the working poor; corporations act like robotic authoritarian managers of worker lives; and many young people are afflicted with mental health issues keeping them from being productive workers. Too many lack college degrees and technology skills. The Salt Lake Chamber adds a lack of sophisticated workforce training, out of control housing prices, transportation shortfalls, and expensive energy to that list of challenges. How great is it to be a little bit better than one’s neighbors at rowing a lifeboat if one is on the sinking American Titanic?
Utah’s state motto, “Industry,” seems well tailored to its current boasting about being the best economy now and forevermore. On the other hand, we would be wise to learn from the state mottos of other jurisdictions across the country. Missouri has one particularly well suited for Utah to learn from: “The welfare of the people is the highest law.” Utah has an aggravated problem of homelessness, poor historical commitment to civics education, and progress-blocking monopolies in its communications industries and political parties all harming the general welfare.
North Carolina’s motto could be put to good use in Utah: “To be, rather than to seem.” In other words, let your actions do the talking, rather than constantly boasting of greatness. How about a little humility, Utah, rather than constantly publishing political administration mottos like “Life Elevated,” and “Keep Utah Great.”
How about Oregon’s motto, “She flies with her own wings.” Wouldn’t it be nice if Utah made it easier for women to get involved in leadership in corporate, government, and church affairs? Women have wings to fly if we just give them a runway to take off from. Instead, Utahns subscribe to the idea that “childless cat ladies” are the bane of American life. They must be barefoot and chained to the refrigerator to be effective women. It might be a source of pride to point out as our local media does that Utah leads the nation in Halloween decorations, but is that the best way for women to be spending their time?
Maryland’s motto would be a good look for Utah if we could ever climb off our high horses: “Strong deeds, gentle words.” A lot less bragging, more humility, and a lot more results would go a long way toward getting things done. Wouldn’t it be nice to see not nearly so many Republican party advertisements of election candidates pointing rifles, firing them off into the blue, and reloading. “Gentle words” people, not fireworks displays and visions of Second Amendment grandiosity.
My grandmother has some advice for Utah’s political leaders today. As a young woman at the turn of the 20th century over a hundred years ago, she sang in the Tabernacle Choir in Salt Lake City. She married an Idaho college graduate and moved back east where the couple got involved in worldly national corporate economic affairs on Wall Street in New York City. She often would say, “If I could buy him for what he’s worth, and sell him for what he thinks he’s worth . . .”
There are plenty of social issues to bring Utah down to earth, if it ever realizes its current value is not as great as it thinks: teen suicide; high divorce rates; a focus on luxury housing rather than affordable housing; what to do about gun control; a civically underinformed higher education system; plunging Medicaid availability; a dearth of union collective bargaining; how to humanely handle people in the country without documentation who commit crimes; whether to be banning books or tolerating them; how to deal with the current philosophy of making vaccines voluntary rather than mandatory; and how to build back trust in all three branches of government.
Folks, “The welfare of the people is the highest law.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020625_Utah-State-Capitol_51-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 18:10:52.705003

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) URBANDALE— The Des Moines region is now home to the first above-ground B99 fueling pump, an action that was celebrated Thursday morning by leaders in the biofuels, trucking and soybean industries.  
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the new pump, which allows certain semi trucks to fill up with a 99% biodiesel blended fuel, shows a completion of the ag supply chain, from the field to the biofuel refineries and now into a truck.
“Every time I see this, or think of an infrastructure investment, I just know that that’s more demand pulling through, and what that ultimately means is more demand for the things that we grow,” Naig said. “It adds value every single step throughout the chain.”

The pump is located at a Pilot fuel station in Urbandale, near the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Interstate 35, and for now will be used primarily by PepsiCo trucks which are equipped to utilize the fuel. 
Eric Fobes, head of renewables for Pilot, said the new biodiesel pump is an adherence to the company’s commitment to “shaping the future of energy.” 
“To me and our customers, it’s important that we are offering decarbonized solutions,” Fobes said. “This is one of those offers.” 
The trucking company launched the first B99 pump at a travel center in Decatur, Illinois in March. The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump. The company has plans to open another pump in Texas this summer. 
PepsiCo has committed local trucks to using the biodiesel from the station, which is several minutes away from the beverage and snack company’s Urbandale plant. 
Sarah Towles, senior director of government affairs for PepsiCo, said the partnership with Pilot represents “real scalable solutions” for long haul transportation. Towles said PepsiCo has about 20 trucks prepared to use the station currently, but plans to equip other trucks in the future. 
Karl Thomas with Optimus Technologies, the company that helped to outfit the PepsiCo trucks to use the fuel, said decarbonizing the industry requires collaboration. 
“Together, we’re building an ecosystem for sustainable trucking by introducing a new fuel to the commercial trucking market in the U.S.” Thomsas said. 
Thomas said Optimus developed a vector system in the trucks which keeps the biodiesel from gelling during colder months. Thomas said this technology, and equipping long haul trucks to run on higher blends of biodiesel is “one of the lowest cost technologies to decarbonize heavy duty trucking.”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 23% of transportation related carbon dioxide emissions came from medium and heavy-duty trucking. The agency encourages the industry to transition to lower emission fuels, like biofuels, hydrogen or compressed natural gas to lower emissions.
Biodiesel supports the soybean industry 
Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand. 
Dave Walton, a director for both Iowa Soybean Association and Iowa Biodiesel Board, said the pump represents, “real on the ground, progress in Americans’ transition to cleaner fuels.”

“By fueling their Des Moines based fleet at this B99 pump, PepsiCo is showing that high blends of biodiesel aren’t just a future concept, they’re here and now, and working,” Walton said. 
Walton said biodiesel is critical to the farm economy and that the industry adds a 13% value to each bushel of soybeans produced by Iowa farmers. 
According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy. 
“Projects like today’s expands consumer access to affordable domestic homegrown fuels that increase good paying jobs for our hardworking Americans,” Walton said. 
Walton also commended Iowa lawmakers, specifically Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale and Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale who were in attendance, for supporting state incentives on biodiesel blends. 
Calls for federal support 
While the industry a high performing year, with a total of 350 million gallons of biodiesel produced in 2024, Walton said several plants in the state are idle due to the uncertainty of federal tax credits. 
Walton said he also hopes EPA will approve 5.25 billion gallons of biodiesel for the upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. This standard sets the minimum amount of renewable fuels required to be blended, annually, into diesel and gasoline. According to EPA, the 2025 requirement for biodiesel was 3.35 billion gallons. 
Naig echoed the call for “strong” Renewable Volume Obligations under RFS and said producers also need clear guidance on tax policy.
Renewable fuel producers in Iowa have been advocating for, and waiting on, definitive guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury on the 45z tax credit, which would incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel and other plant-based fuels. 
A bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines, could also impact the biofuels industry’s ability to use these credits, which is a major reason why the industry has opposed the legislation, which is currently sitting on Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk. 
Naig said he has heard from folks on both sides of the issue, but the decision on the bill rests with Reynolds and her council.

At a roundtable discussion hosted by U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, Vermont business owners said hefty tariffs have caused chaos, hurting small companies, consumers and innovation. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Lots of frustration’: Sen. Welch, southern Vermont business leaders sound off on tariffs.","Vermont business leaders gathered Wednesday, May 28, with U.S. Sen. Peter Welch in Manchester at the Orvis rod shop and factory. Photo by Greta Solsa/VTDigger.The Vermont-based fly-fishing company Orvis is now facing pressures “at a pace that we haven’t faced in our 170-year career,” company president Simon Perkins said at a roundtable on tariffs hosted by U.S. Sen. Peter Welch.At Orvis’ flagship rod shop and factory on Wednesday, Perkins said the Trump administration’s shifting policies have not given businesses enough time to adapt their sourcing and manufacturing models to absorb the shock of tariffs. “It’s really hard for a business to respond quick enough to make it work,” Perkins said. “That’s when prices for consumers, that’s when American jobs, that’s when American manufacturing, that’s when that gets put at risk.”Welch said he aims to highlight business leaders impacted by new tariff policies through roundtable discussions around the state. American business owners and consumers will bear the costs of tariffs, which Welch claimed are analogous to the “biggest tax increase in decades.”The Trump administration has changed course on tariff policies 21 times since February, according to reporting by Forbes. Kevin Meyers of Mary Meyers Stuffed Toys, a wholesale toy manufacturer based out of Townshend, said he feels “lots of frustration” with the fast-paced changes to tariffs. He said one of the challenges as a business owner is staying informed and charting a way forward amid the uncertain impact of tariff policies. This sentiment was echoed by many business leaders at the roundtable. “How can you have a business that way?” Meyers said. “How can you plan for your new product lines that are coming out, how to price them, where to get them made?”Vermont business leaders gathered Wednesday, May 28, with U.S. Sen. Peter Welch in Manchester at the Orvis rod shop and factory. Photo by Greta Solsa/VTDigger.Vermont is one of 34 states that hold Canada as its top foreign trade partner, and many businesses nationwide are feeling the effects of erratic tariff policy, Welch said. Last week, Welch and four other congressional colleagues met with the Canadian prime minister and other officials to help restore the relationship, but he said “that requires us to get back on track to a mutually beneficial trade regime.”Tim Miles, the fourth-generation owner of building supplier rk Miles, said his business relies on price stability for wood products sourced from Canada or hardware supplies sourced abroad. He said his customers are often spending large sums to build or renovate their homes and need to plan ahead for costs, but that sudden tariffs are causing “a lot of confusion in the marketplace for our customers.”David Black and Anya Wrede, who contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and create specialty bikes and mobility equipment for those with disabilities through their company RAD Innovations Inc., said they source specialized components from around the world for their bike designs.Black said sourcing specialized components locally for bikes designed to fit the needs of each outdoor recreator is “logistically impossible to imagine.” He said the erratic nature of the Trump administration’s tariff policies undermines the company’s dependability and survival. Coral Vogel Cutting, owner of Brattleboro-based Back Roads Granola, said the 20 ingredients essential for her organic, non-GMO, vegan granola cannot be grown locally, so the company is forced to bear the cost of tariffs. She said the company does not have much leeway to increase their prices to recuperate costs, as customers already pay “top dollar” for the high-quality product. “We cannot source the quantities of ingredients that we need for most of our products within the United States. It just does not exist,” Vogel Cutting said. “We’ve built our brand around making a very clean product, and now we’re being penalized for that.”Perkins, of the Orvis fly-fishing equipment company, said the continued uncertainty with the Trump administration’s tariff policies will “stall out innovation” because businesses have to plan ahead for pricing and demand before taking a risk on a new product. “Innovation starts with strategy and the strategy starts with the customer and understanding the marketplace,” Perkins said. “If that’s unknown, it’s really hard to understand how you’re going to build that pathway to innovation.”Welch said he is concerned with the Trump administration’s tariff policies using a “very blunt instrument in an arbitrary way.” Although the Constitution gives Congress the power to set tariffs, it allowed the executive branch to take on that role through the Trade Act of 1974.“It’s been distressing to me that many of my colleagues are accepting the utilization of that limited authority that was given at a time when it was more restrained, and are not insisting that we take back the capacity in Congress to do what the Constitution provides us with the authority to do,” Welch said. The same day Vermont business leaders met in Manchester, the U.S. Court of International Trade found the tariffs unconstitutional. The panel of judges ruled that the broad 10% tariff on most of foreign U.S. trading partners and the specific tariff policies against Canada, China and Mexico for national security reasons exceeded the authority of the executive branch. But the decision was temporarily halted on Thursday by the U.S. Court of Appeals, so tariffs will continue to be imposed for now.Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Lots of frustration’: Sen.

Late on a Sunday evening in April, Silas Smith, an AmeriCorps service member working with a food security nonprofit in the Flathead Valley, was scrolling the internet when he found a Reddit post detailing a proposed list of AmeriCorps programs that might be axed nationwide. 
His program in Montana was on the list.
The next afternoon, at 4:09 p.m. Smith received an email letting him know his AmeriCorps service programs had been terminated by the federal government, part of the sweeping cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 
“Effective April 28, 2025, you have been removed from the STATE OF MT DEPT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AmeriCorps VISTA project,” the email read. It told Smith he was in an “administrative hold,” meaning he would continue to receive his living stipend for 30 more days, but was not allowed to participate in any AmeriCorps-related activities or projects. 
Even with Smith’s brief forewarning, receiving the official termination letter “was surreal. It was strange.”
“I was watching a movie when I got the email and it was very cold and kind of heartless,” Smith said. “I think they literally sent the same termination email to thousands of people — no differentiation between any of us.”
Smith said his AmeriCorps supervisor at the state health department hadn’t known the program was going to be cut, was “just as confused as I was,” and was navigating it in real time with 27 service members across Montana. 
AmeriCorps is a national program established under President Bill Clinton to provide Americans with domestic service opportunities to foster civic engagement and address community needs, similar to the international Peace Corps. The program places recent college graduates and early-career professionals in roles with nonprofits, community organizations and public agencies. Service members receive a living stipend of around $18,000, in addition to an education award of up to $7,395 that can be used to pay for educational expenses or repay student loans. 
On April 25, the Trump administration announced cuts of more than $400 million in grants  — 41% of its total grant funding — to AmeriCorps, and subsequently terminated more than 32,000 members and volunteers. Around 85% of the program’s federal staff were placed on leave.    
Each year AmeriCorps places more than 200,000 service members and volunteers nationally. Last year in Montana, 2,800 AmeriCorps members and senior volunteers worked at more than 300 locations, according to the agency’s National Service Report. AmeriCorps invested more than $12.7 million in federal funding to community organizations and agencies in the state, and generated “more than $10 million in outside resources from businesses, foundations, public agencies and other sources in Montana,” according to the report.










“These service members bring so much back to their communities. There’s something really big that will be lost if we aren’t bringing them in.”


– Shannon Stober


Some AmeriCorps leaders in Montana have said that while they understand a need for belt tightening at the federal level, they don’t see deep cuts at AmeriCorps as strategic. 
JoJo McKinney, CEO of Montana Conservation Corps, which has around 320 AmeriCorps service members each year, said studies have shown that there is an average $34 return for each federal dollar spent on the program, with some programs generating twice that impact. 
“AmeriCorps is a real force multiplier. The return on investment is so dramatic,” McKinney said. “It’s one of the most efficient uses of taxpayer money.”
In Montana, AmeriCorps members — considered volunteers, not employees — work at schools, food banks, homeless shelters, health clinics, veterans facilities, and myriad nonprofits — of which Montana has a higher than average number per capita. They also work for some government agencies, including Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which has used AmeriCorps members to work in state parks. 
The federal cuts eliminated AmeriCorps programs entirely from 13 states, including Wyoming, and removed roughly $1.2 million in programmatic funding in Montana. 
“I don’t want to say we were lucky — that’s just plain wrong — but some states lost it all,” said Shannon Stober, a member of the Montana Last Best Alums Council, the official alumni group of AmeriCorps members in the state. Stober has spent more than two decades working in leadership roles for various AmeriCorps programs.
Stober said analysis of the proposed federal budget under the Trump administration indicates further cuts to AmeriCorps are planned, potentially jeopardizing the programs that escaped the first round.  
“The issue now is our remaining programs and just wanting to protect them,” Stober said. “There’s such a lack of trust and uncertainty at this point – we want our service members to feel protected.”
According to a list compiled by America’s Service Commissions, in Montana, seven AmeriCorps grants were cut, which included five coordinating programs funding 80 service members and two planning initiative grants working to build out new programs. 
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Rural Dynamics Inc, Montana State University, the University of Montana, the Department of Labor and Industry, and Montana AgCorps, run through the Department of Agriculture, all saw grants pulled away with little warning.
Representatives from DLI, UM, Department of Ag, and the Department of Public Health and Human Services did not respond to repeated requests for comment, representatives from FWP and MSU were not authorized to speak about the cuts, and representatives from the governor’s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
“These cuts are removing entry level positions for young people, taking away workforce development … AmeriCorps provides a space for those people,” Stober said. “These service members bring so much back to their communities. There’s something really big that will be lost if we aren’t bringing them in.”

Smith was part of the AmeriCorps VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) program coordinated through DPHHS, which placed members with nonprofits working with underserved populations in the state.
Smith was embedded with Land to Hand MT, which works to build a “strong community food system that fosters socially just ways of accessing food,” in the Flathead Valley. One program Land to Hand operates is a weekend backpack program in Columbia Falls, where school kids who rely on free or reduced school meals receive food bags for their families. The program gives out nearly 400 bags each week. 
When he joined Land to Hand, Smith was assigned a project building on the weekend backpack program — setting up a food pantry to allow students and their families to have more choices in meals. 
“The goal of the pantry would be to match, or surpass the number of clients we serve with the backpack program,” Smith said. “With a pantry, people can drop in whenever they want. we can make it a relaxing environment that’s intuitive in the way it’s laid out and work to reduce the stigma around using food-accessible services.” 
Smith said he felt called to his position, telling the Daily Montanan he understands how integral food is to a community. 
“Better food is connected to so many things,” he said. “When kids have reliable access to food and they feel safe and comfortable getting food from a nonprofit like ours, they can self-actualize and get more quality in their education. They won’t be restless in class. Parents and families with better access to food can parent better and have less stress at home.”
Since starting in his position in January, Smith has been researching policies and procedures necessary to set up the pantry and working to see what the community needs most. He has a goal to get the pantry up and running by the start of the next school year. 
“To do any new big projects, it takes a lot of effort and work,” said Land to Hand Executive Director Gretchen Boyer. “It’s a huge deal not to have that help. We were anticipating that help through the end of the year. Whenever nonprofits are doing something new, it takes time to raise funds and make plans. We thought we had this year to do that, but with no notice, all that help we had anticipated was just ripped out from underneath us.” 
Boyer said the organization decided they were going to “fight to keep Silas with us,” and called in their biggest fundraising partners. The organization has raised more than $30,000 from the community to keep him in his current role and are confident they’ll be able to fund and house Smith for the duration of his term. 
“Don’t get me wrong, the government can work more efficiently, and we can be smart in how we spend our money. But when we just arbitrarily cut programs without seeing the impact on services and people, it’s ridiculous,” Boyer said. “These are young people coming to work in rural communities, working to eliminate poverty. And they’re living in poverty to do it.”
To partner with AmeriCorps, organizations have to fund part of the project — Land to Hand paid $5,000 for its latest contract — and provide some of a rent stipend. Boyer said it’s one of the biggest returns on investment a nonprofit like hers can get.
Boyer added there’s often a high retention rate among AmeriCorps members. Land to Hand has had an AmeriCorps member on staff for the last seven years, and all but one of the organization’s staff members are previous AmeriCorps members — including two that served with Land to Hand. 










“These are young people coming to work in rural communities, working to eliminate poverty. And they're living in poverty to do it.”

Many AmeriCorps partner organizations, however, don’t have the ability to raise money and retain their members. 
Astrid Weinstein, a member of Smith’s AmeriCorps VISTA cohort based in Missoula, was also terminated.
Weinstein was working with Mountain Home Montana, a Missoula nonprofit that serves young mothers who are pregnant or already parenting, providing housing and services including child care and maternal health services.
She said her project with Mountain Home included working as a volunteer coordinator and helping create a “baby boutique” for mothers and families to come and shop for free or heavily discounted clothes and other early childhood accessories. She said she’s “50-50” on whether the organization will be able to continue the program without a full-time staff member.
The termination of Weinstein’s cohort in Missoula impacted her beyond her day-to-day job. 
She had been in her role for eight months and lived with other service members, including her best friend, who had to move home to Alaska following the termination. 
“It was such a huge change for us. We thought we had a couple of months to figure stuff out, find next steps,” said Weinstein, who was planning to apply to be the AmeriCorps cohort supervisor for her program for the next year. But now, “I don’t think I would try to do another AmeriCorps program. Everyone is on their toes right now and worried.”

AmeriCorps has three main service branches — the VISTA program, state and national programs, and the National Civilian Community Corps. NCCC members often work on disaster response, infrastructure and development-related projects. 
In addition to the $400 million in grant funds that the federal government terminated, AmerCorps sent home all of its NCCC members.
The Helena Area Habitat for Humanity in a Facebook post said that more than 60 NCCC members have served with the organization, contributing more than 9,000 hours of service and labor to build affordable homes. In addition, six full-time AmeriCorps members with Habitat, a program that retained its funding, have helped “build programs that simply wouldn’t exist without their dedication and service. 
“These folks didn’t just swing hammers. They laid the foundation for a stronger, more connected community. Their absence will be deeply felt.”
One $100,000 planning initiative grant cut was housed at MSU where staff were working to create a Community Health Corps in the state. The program would have placed AmeriCorps members in community partnerships to address “the state’s most pressing health challenges,” including mental health and substance use disorder services, chronic disease prevention and management, and addressing social determinants of health. 
All activities related to that planning initiative are paused with future funding in question. 
Some programs, such as the North Valley Food Bank in Whitefish, had an AmeriCorps member finish a service term right before the federal cuts, but are now unlikely to get another member in the future. 
For programs that escaped the April funding cuts, such as Montana Conservation Corps, concerns about future funding loom large. 
“We’re not sure about if our grant for 2026 will be approved — normally we hear that announcement in April,” McKinney told the Daily Montanan. “The funds have been appropriated by Congress for that grant, but I don’t know if there’s the staff at AmeriCorps to be able to review and award those grants for next year. I’m very worried in the long term.”
Montana Conservation Corps onboarded 200 AmeriCorps members in their various conservation, leadership development and agricultural programs, bringing the total number of service members to around 320 for this year. 
Some of MCC’s projects last year included conducting more than 1,500 miles of trail maintenance, helping ranching communities build drought resistance and doing wildfire fuel reduction projects on federal lands. 
McKinney said future cuts to the program could affect MCC in multiple ways — the $4 million annual AmeriCorps grants make up 28% of the organization’s budget, and AmeriCorps members have their own special classification under the Department of Labor, which makes it easier to partner with, and receive additional matching funds, from federal agencies, such as the Forest Service and National Park Service. 
“We will not replace $4 million with philanthropic resources, nor will we replace the value of the service members,” McKinney said
“I think the loss of AmeriCorps for Montana communities and small local organizations is pretty devastating,” McKinney continued. “The beauty of AmeriCorps is that while it’s a federal program, it’s a locally driven service initiative. Local communities identify their needs and then leverage AmeriCorps members and resources to address them and bring about solutions.”

At Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the funding cut affected nine AmeriCorps members stationed at state parks, but officials with the department would not discuss where those members were stationed or what the impact to park services would be. 
According to a 2018 article FWP published in Montana Outdoors magazine, AmeriCorps members “eased park managers’ burdens by creating interpretive trails, controlling invasive weeds, teaching in outdoor classrooms, organizing volunteer events such as spring cleanups, and more.”
That year, AmeriCorps members conducted more than 577 educational and interpretive programs, coordinated 369 volunteers, and improved 264 acres of state park land. 
Sarah Sadowski, director of the governor’s Office of Community Service, which coordinates the state-run AmeriCorps programs, was not authorized to speak to reporters, but provided a statement. 
“Upon receiving notice from AmeriCorps, the Governor’s Office of Community Service responded immediately to support service members through a transition period. Where possible, our office and network of partners has ensured the placement of AmeriCorps service members in new roles to meet needs of community programs administered by state agencies, including at the Montana Departments of Agriculture and Fish, Wildlife and Parks.”
McKinney, though, said youth need the program, and the country needs the program too.
“This is something our country should be supporting right now,” McKinney said. “Sure, it can be reformed and improved, but let’s do that, not throw away this opportunity for young and old Americans to invest back into our country. 



 Cuts lead to federal lawsuit, finger pointing

In response to the funding cuts, a coalition of 24 states, plus D.C., have sued the Trump administration over the AmeriCorps cuts, alleging the White House did not have the authority to eliminate the program, which is funded and authorized by Congress. 
Montana is not part of the suit. 
Representatives from Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office did not respond to requests for comment. 
The Daily Montanan reached out to all four members of Montana’s congressional delegation, and did not receive responses. 
But a letter from U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy addressing the cuts and obtained by the Daily Montanan said the reductions were part of the plan to tackle the growing national debt, and attributed them to a lack of fiscal accountability by AmeriCorps. 
“In November 2024, the nonpartisan Inspector General of AmeriCorps found that AmeriCorps has been unable to produce an auditable financial statement in the past eight years. With $36 trillion in debt and growing, fiscal accountability must be asked of every part of our government,” the letter states. “The Trump Administration is working to balance the budget, lower taxes, lower costs, unleash prosperity, and help every American keep more of their hard-earned money. As the administration works to rein in spending, eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, and deliver government services more efficiently, I will work to ensure critical frontline services are protected.”
Shannon Stober, though, a member of the Montana Last Best Alums Council, the official alumni group of AmeriCorps members in the state, said the argument is a double standard.
“AmeriCorps shouldn’t be politicized — for 30 years it’s been a bipartisan-supported initiative,” Stober said. “Audits aren’t meant to be verdicts. Auditors do findings, and those findings are not always corruption and waste. Agencies not passing audits is common in the federal government.”
For example, Stober and JoJo McKinney, with Montana Conservation Corps, both pointed to the Department of Defense, which has received a “disclaimer of opinion” — the same finding AmeriCorps earned — on seven annual audits since 2018, meaning “auditors could not express opinions on the financial statements, because the financial information was not sufficiently reliable,” according to the 2024 audit results.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529_153446-1-scaled-e1748554727313-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-05-29 18:10:52.705003

Higher ed leaders to conduct review after revelations in Holmberg sex case

The University System announced last month that it would conduct the internal review after people connected to North Dakota higher education were named in investigation documents released by the state attorney general. 
After going into a closed-door executive session to discuss the review by the system’s chief compliance officer, board chair Tim Mihalick read a statement saying that no policy violations, including failure to report criminal activity, were found among current employees. 
Mihalick said the compliance officer reviewed thousands of pages of internal documents and law enforcement materials. 
Mihalick’s statement said the University System would hire a neutral third party to complete the investigation.

Holmberg represented Grand Forks, home to the University of North Dakota, in the Legislature for 45 years. He was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison. 
Holmberg pleaded guilty last year to federal charges related to his trips to the Czech Republic to engage in illicit sexual conduct. 
Holmberg’s time in the Legislature included chairing a Higher Education Committee and the House Appropriations Committee that influenced university budgets.  
One person named in the investigation documents released in April is Bruce Gjovig, who led the Center for Innovation at UND. Gjovig retired in 2017. 
Records showed emails between Holmberg and Gjovig about his trips to Prague. 
A statement from Gjovig issued through his lawyer said Gjovig was not aware of Holmberg’s crimes. 
Holmberg also emailed Nick Hacker, who at the time was a member of the State Board of Higher Education, about a sexual encounter in Taiwan. Hacker has said the email was unsolicited and he didn’t respond to it. 
Testimony at Holmberg’s sentencing in March included a former UND graduate student who described being manipulated by Holmberg to perform sex acts.

Court documents described Holmberg using access to the president’s suite at UND hockey games as a way to influence young men, an accusation his attorney refuted during a March sentencing hearing. 
UND President Andrew Armacost said after Thursday’s meeting that the university is willing to help anyone who was negatively impacted by Holmberg’s actions. 
“My main priority is to make sure that the members of the campus feel supported,” he said. 
Armacost became UND’s president in June 2020, about two years before Holmberg resigned his Senate seat amid the sexual misconduct investigation.

SPRINGFIELD — With two days left in the legislative session, lawmakers in Springfield announced a pair of plans for how to reform Chicagoland transit agencies after two years of debate, one of which would come with a spate of new taxes.

The proposals give new power to the agency that oversees the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace Suburban Bus. The newly renamed Northern Illinois Transit Authority would have sweeping authority to set policies for the Chicagoland transit agencies, which together serve about two-thirds of the state’s residents.

Under House Bill 3438 originating in the Senate, NITA and the state would impose new taxes in northern Illinois, higher tolls on highways, fees on rideshare services and a new tax on electric vehicle charging. Senate Bill 2111 originating in the House does not address funding.

But the bills are not done. Lawmakers in both chambers say the proposals require additional work, which must happen quickly as lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn for the summer on Saturday, May 31.

“The goal is that we’re going to align both bills,” House bill sponsor Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, said.

Despite a long process of negotiation, several important groups still oppose the bills, including representatives of organized labor, the suburbs and lawmakers concerned the plan disproportionately benefits Chicago and its residents.

“This is a billion-dollar bailout for Mayor Brandon Johnson being paid for by suburban taxpayers without giving them a real voice,” Sen. Don DeWitte, R-St. Charles, said in a committee hearing on the Senate proposal. “It's a simple math problem. Chicago and Cook County get the majority of the board votes. Suburbs are outvoted on just about everything — fares, service, cuts, tax increases; that's not reform. That's a takeover.”

Funding remains an open question 

The legislature began working on transit reform more than two years ago facing post-pandemic ridership slumps. Transit officials from the Regional Transportation Authority and other agencies have calculated that they face a $771 million annual budget shortfall beginning in 2026.

Since then, the Regional Transportation Authority has said that without state help, transit agencies would have to make a 40% reduction in service when pandemic relief funds run dry.

The plan by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, in the Senate would raise at least enough money to plug the hole, although exactly how much remains unclear.

Suburban residents would see several new taxes to fund transit that Chicago residents already pay, among other proposals to raise revenue:

A tax on real estate transfers in the city would be extended to the rest of Cook County and the collar counties, costing buyers and sellers of real estate $3 in taxes for every $1,000 of the transaction. Funds generated from the tax in the collar counties would go toward transit supportive developments while half the funds from suburban Cook County would go toward the CTA pensions.
The suburbs also would be subjected to a 10% tax on rideshares.
Counties would no longer get to keep a portion of the transit sales tax for their own infrastructure projects. Instead, it would be redirected to NITA.
Anyone traveling on Illinois tollways, which are mostly located in the suburbs, would also have to pay an additional 50 cents per toll, with the money going toward funding public transportation.
Electric vehicle drivers would also have to pay a tax to charge their vehicles. Drivers would be charged 6 cents per kilowatt hour at public charging stations in 2026, with the tax increasing based on inflation each year after that.


While supporting the bill, Illinois Environmental Council Legislative Director Dany Robles said he’s concerned the tax will discourage using EVs in low-income communities.

The taxes represent “shared sacrifices,” Villivalam said.

The bill introduced in the House has no new mechanism for funding but does lay out limited reforms to the agencies’ fiscal systems.

Both bills lower the “farebox recovery ratio,” the proportion of money that must come from fares. Until the pandemic, agencies in Chicagoland had to make 50% of their revenue from fares. This provision in the law has been suspended since the onset of the pandemic.

The House plan would lower that portion 25% until 2029, then further lowered to 20%. The Senate version would keep it set at 25%, Villivalam said.

The legislation would also formalize free and reduced fare programs, many of which are already in place. These include free fare programs for military personnel, seniors, people with disabilities, and some low-income people.

Organized labor, municipal opposition  

The bills drew immediate opposition from several important groups in Springfield, including leaders of organized labor. In a House committee Thursday morning, AFL-CIO President Tim Drea said the House version’s lack of a funding mechanism was a concern.

""We want reforms and funding to go hand in hand,” Drea said, noting that his organization is also opposed to the Senate’s specific funding proposals.

Many representatives of organized labor were also unhappy with the revenue-raising mechanisms proposed in the Senate.

Marc Poulos, executive director of Local 150, said many of the tax increases were unacceptable. He argued tollway revenue is supposed to be dedicated to road improvements and deviating from that could violate the tollway’s bond agreements.

“This proposal is inequitable, as urban drivers would effectively subsidize urban transit systems such as the CTA,” Poulos told a Senate committee.

Cities and towns in northern Illinois also opposed the legislation.

The city of Chicago opposes a provision limiting the ability for the Chicago Transit Authority to take on debt at a time they’re working on several major infrastructure projects, according to Illinois Municipal Leage President Brad Cole, who represents Chicago and other Illinois municipalities at the Statehouse. Cole said suburban cities and towns also had “significant concerns” about the board of the new authority. Will County Executive Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant said redirecting a portion of the existing transit sales tax away from counties would create a $38 million budget hole in Will County.

“This bill, the form before us today, doesn't fix transit,” Bertino-Tarrant said. “Instead, it takes away the ability for county and local government to provide services. We agree that we need public safety reform. We agree that we need more accountability, but stripping counties – and I'm here speaking for all the counties today – (of) the dedicated sales tax as part of the last RTA agreement will cripple government.”

 Sweeping oversight power 

Under both plans, the empowered oversight agency, NITA, also has broad new powers to control transit planning and policy in Chicagoland.

NITA would have “sole authority” to set fares and to “establish the nature and standards of public transit” in the region. This is a break from the current system, which grants more power to individual transit agencies.

The bill also requires NITA to implement an “integrated fare” system so transit riders can use one payment system for all Chicagoland transit systems and transfer more easily between systems.

NITA would also be empowered to set “service standards,” meaning NITA would be responsible for frequency, wait times, vehicle types, stop spacing along transit routes, amenities at stops and on vehicles, some route planning and the coverage area for transit services.

On top of that, the bill opens the door for NITA to add new transit services, such as streetcars, light rail and bus rapid transit.

Governance, a recurring issue over the years this bill has been negotiated, would also be upended. While the RTA board had 16 members, the new NITA board would have 20 members. The new board would have five members appointed by the governor, the mayor of Chicago and the president of Cook County Board of Commissioners. The five remaining members will come from the five “collar counties” surrounding Cook County.

The expanded board also has firing power for the heads of Pace, Metra and the CTA. This follows years of criticism of former CTA President Dorval Carter, who stepped down in January.

NITA would also have new authority to take on real estate development projects near train stations and bus stops.

Expanding police on transit

One of the top priorities for Chicagoland transit in Springfield has been to increase “safety” on trains and buses. During the pandemic, the crime rate on CTA trains and buses spiked. While it remains slightly above pre-pandemic averages, that has fallen as more people return to taking public transit.

Under the new bill, several councils, task forces and other bodies would be created to try and identify ways to make transit safer.

NITA would have one year to approve a “sworn law enforcement officer crime prevention program,” which would outline how the agency will use police officers to prevent and address crime on transit.

It would follow months of work with Chicago police, county sheriffs, the state police and other law enforcement agencies looking into the subject and making recommendations.

(Antonio Diaz/Getty Images)In a step intended to improve maternal and childhood outcomes in New Mexico, doulas will soon be able to enroll as Medicaid providers in the state. 
The Doula Credentialing Act, passed during the recent legislative session and signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on March 21, goes into effect on July 1. The act requires the Department of Health create a voluntary credentialing process for doulas, which will make the birthworkers eligible to receive Medicaid reimbursement. 
As defined under the law, doula means “a trained, nonmedical professional who provides services, including health education, advocacy or physical, emotional or social support, to a person during the pre-conception period, pregnancy, childbirth or the postpartum period to promote positive health outcomes.”
HB214 also establishes a Doula Credentialing Advisory Council; requires hospitals and freestanding birth centers to create policies to allow doulas to accompany patients during particular services; and creates a Doula Fund to support the provisions of the bill.
New Mexico Doula Association Executive Director Melissa Lopez-Sullivan told Source NM that the health department, the Health and Human Services Department, Medicaid, Managed Care Organizations and community-based organizations are currently all working together to finalize a “provider toolkit” to help doulas navigate Medicaid processes. 
Several doulas have certified with NMDOH and some have already contracted with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations,” Lopez-Sullivan told Source in a written statement. “These are major milestones — because of them, Medicaid beneficiaries in some areas now have access to doula services as a covered benefit, many for the first time.”
She added that the doula association and its partners will soon offer “technical assistance and enrollment support,” as well as “culturally grounded training,” to further assist doulas in their work in New Mexico communities.
Rep. Doreen Gallegos (D-Las Cruces), lead sponsor of HB214, told Source NM that the overall goal with the bill has always been to “serve a larger number” of patients in the state and that care will start right away in July.
“A doula can help in so many ways,” Gallegos told Source. “It’s hard to sometimes make decisions when you’re under that kind of stress and having somebody that’s there with you, that can help walk through the process, that maybe is familiar with the doctors at the facility that you’re at, or if you’re doing a home birth, if things start to go sideways, that you have somebody to consult with.”
She added that healthcare access is limited in New Mexico, particularly in the more rural communities, and expanding the reach of doulas will help meet the needs of more pregnant people.
“Sometimes you just have questions and sometimes medical professionals are so busy because they’re in such demand right now, that they don’t get to answer all those questions,” Gallegos said. “Or if you have something in the middle of the night that you’re not sure about and you have this relationship with this doula, it can really [help].”
Lopez Sullivan told Source that the bill formally acknowledges the work doulas, particularly community-based doulas, do in the state and provides a path “toward economic sustainability.” 
“Many doulas have been doing this work—quietly and powerfully—for decades, without compensation or institutional support. This legislation acknowledges their expertise and makes space for them to lead within maternal health systems,” she wrote. “For patients, especially Black, Indigenous, rural, and LGBTQIA+ families, this law opens new access to care that centers their identities, values, and choices…In a state where Black and Indigenous birthing people face the greatest maternal mortality, HB214 represents a necessary shift toward equity and dignity.”
N.M. ‘far above the national rate’ even as maternal deaths increase across the country

According to a 2023 report released by the March of Dimes, a national nonprofit organization that advocates for maternal and baby health, a third of New Mexico counties are described as maternity care deserts, where access to medical care is limited or nonexistent. The report also notes that about 18% of New Mexico women do not live within 30 minutes of a birthing hospital, compared to the national average of 9.7%, and 23.3% of birthing people received little or no prenatal care compared to 14.8% nationally. 
Gallegos described doula care as a “wraparound of services” as well, because these providers not only assist patients before a child is born, but after as well, as parents settle into life with a new baby.
“I think that’s problematic for New Mexico that we are losing doctors, and so we’ve got to have an environment that helps keep doctors in New Mexico so they can practice. And we also open it up to different types of holistic type of help that people can choose,” Gallegos said. “We’d better give people options to what fits their lifestyle and what makes them the most comfortable and making sure that they can make decisions that are best for themselves and for their families.”
Maternal death reviews get political as state officials intrude

Lopez-Sullivan said she believes HB214 sets a good foundation for care in New Mexico, but the state needs to continue to invest in “community-rooted care” and providers; ensure the systems HB214 create actually work in favor of doulas; establish long-term support for the doula workforce, including training and fair compensation; and expand midwifery and other community birth options.
“Improving maternal outcomes also means supporting midwives and community birth centers—especially in rural and Indigenous communities. These models offer holistic, accessible, and culturally resonant care that families trust,” Lopez-Sullivan wrote. “By investing in midwifery and Indigenous-led care, we can further reduce preventable harm and build the systems our communities deserve.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana politicians would be able to use money they raise to run for elected office on a much broader group of expenses, including their home mortgages, country club fees and gym memberships under legislation Gov. Jeff Landry is pushing. 
Louisiana House Republican Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, is sponsoring a sprawling rewrite of Louisiana’s campaign finance laws in House Bill 693. The 101-page legislation loosens dozens of restrictions placed on the people and political groups who raise and spend money on state and local elections. 
The Louisiana Board of Ethics has for years prohibited elected officials and candidates from spending campaign and political action committee (PAC) money on property they own. Wright’s bill would make that type of spending legal under certain circumstances. 

For example, a candidate or elected official could use their campaign and PAC money to help pay off a portion of their home mortgage, as long as part of the property was used for campaign purposes and the candidate charged his campaign “fair market value,” under one provision of the legislation. 
The bill was largely written by two private attorneys who work for Gov. Jeff Landry and represented him in multiple legal disputes he has with the ethics board. 

Most recently, lawyers Stephen Gelé and Charles Spies are working for Landry as the governor faces ethics charges for failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor’s plane in 2021. But Wright’s legislation would not affect the outcome of that case against Landry. 
Gelé has described the massive rewrite of the state’s campaign finance laws as an effort to “modernize” Louisiana’s practices and bring them more in line with federal campaign finance law. 
“This campaign finance legislation respects fundamental constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and due process, and updates the statute providing clear rules governing current campaign practices, while still providing transparency and preventing the appearance of corruption,” Gelé said in a written statement to the Illuminator. 
Wright said his legislation is also meant to address frustrations elected officials have with ethics board fines and investigations into their spending. 

“There’s a lot of people who don’t like what they do or don’t do,” Wright said. “For whatever reason, people don’t feel like they are getting a fair review.”
Legislators’ ambivalence to the ethics board has been reflected in support for the bill. Wright’s proposal easily cleared the Louisiana House of Representatives on a 77-16 vote, with a small group of Democrats in opposition. The Senate is now considering the bill, which needs approval from both chambers before June 12.  
One of the state’s preeminent government watchdog groups, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, warned the bill would open the door to at least the appearance of political corruption. 
“Louisiana, historically, had serious corruption problems and the Board of Ethics was sort of created to look at that,” Steven Procopio, the organization’s president, said in an interview. “[G]iven our history, it’s very important that we not backslide.” 
“It doesn’t solve any problem for citizens. What it really solves is making things more convenient for public officials,” he added. 
Wright’s proposal is part of a wider effort to weaken the ethics board authority overall that concerns Procopio. There are two other bills in the Senate that would also make it harder for the board to enforce ethics law violations. 
“I can’t find a single reason why citizens would support this,” he said. 

What would be allowed

Should it pass, Wright’s legislation would explicitly let political candidates, elected officials and their PACs spend money on a long list of new services and expenses that aren’t laid out in the current law. 

These proposed allowable expenses would include: 

*Paying lobbyists at the State Capitol and in Washington D.C.
* Paying for an elected official or candidate’s spouse and children to accompany them to Washington Mardi Gras, a national political convention or any professional conference attended as an elected official.
*Covering any fines or penalties the ethics board has levied against a person for violating campaign finance or ethics laws. 

* Paying for security measures such as cameras and fences to be installed in order to protect a candidate or elected official, including at their personal residence or office. 
*Payments on a personal or business loan, including a home mortgage, on property owned by the candidate as long as the candidate is using a portion of that property for campaign purposes and is charging his campaign “fair market” value. For example, this could include storing campaign signs in the garage of an elected official’s house and then charging the campaign the market rate of a local storage locker.
*Paying dues, fees and gratuities to a social organization such as a country club, fitness center, Mardi Gras krewe or any other “nonpolitical organization” as long as the membership “facilitates” interaction with a constituent, another elected official or a former elected official.
The ethics board has explicitly not allowed some of these proposed campaign expenses under the current law for several years. 

For example, those who miss deadlines for submitting campaign finance reports cannot use their PAC or campaign account to pay the financial penalties the board imposes on them. It must come from their personal funds under current law. Wright’s legislation would eliminate that restriction. 
The ethics board has also generally interpreted a legal ban on using campaign and PAC money for “personal use” to mean a candidate or elected official cannot use their political cash to help pay off loans on buildings, homes and other property they own. 

In 2007, the ethics board told former state Treasurer John Schroder his political campaign could not lease office space from a company he owned. Schroder, who was treasurer from 2017-24, was running for his first state elected office in the Louisiana of Representatives at the time. 

“A candidate cannot do business with himself,” Gray Sexton, who served as general counsel to the state ethics board for 40 years, said about current ethics laws in an interview earlier this month. 
Yet Wright’s legislation would reverse that board opinion, allowing others like Schroder to lease out not only their commercial property to campaigns, but also their personal residences. 
“This would allow market value transactions between the candidate and the campaign to go forward,” said Sexton, who now represents politicians who appear before the ethics board in his private law practice. 
Eighteen years after seeking that opinion, Schroder said he agrees with the ruling the ethics board initially gave him. 
“I think it just erodes public trust,” he said of politicians paying their personal businesses with campaign or PAC funds. “The public just doesn’t trust the politician or the political space today.”
Carnival costs
Wright’s legislation would also definitively declare that elected officials can use their political money to cover membership dues for Mardi Gras krewes and the balls and parades they host. 

The ethics board has spent decades wrestling over whether expenses related to participating in Mardi Gras can be covered with campaign funds, and its response has often been muddled. Most of the board’s public guidance about Mardi Gras is also nearly 30 years old. 
In early 1998, the state ethics board told St. Tammany Parish officials they couldn’t use campaign funds to “join a local civic organization which holds meetings and functions culminating in a Mardi Gras parade.” Later that year, the board reiterated that same stance when asked for a similar opinion. 
“Campaign funds may not be used to pay for membership dues and expenses related to an organization which holds a Mardi Gras parade,” the board wrote at the time. 

But in the months that followed, the board issued advisories allowing campaign funds to cover some Mardi Gras expenses. 
In 1998 and 1999, the board said elected officials could use campaign money to purchase Mardi Gras parade throws bearing their name or likeness. Their election funds could also cover the costs of a candidate participating in a parade, as long as it wasn’t krewe membership dues and the elected official wasn’t covering their face on the parade route, which is common for many parades.
Should Wright’s legislation pass, none of these restrictions would remain relevant because the new law would allow politicians to use their campaign and PAC money for krewe dues, as long as being a member of the krewe helped them interact with a constituent, another elected official or a former elected official. 

The bill also contains a provision to allow elected officials and candidates to spend even more freely on “events related to the Mardi Gras celebration in Washington D.C.” 

Every year, thousands of politically connected Louisiana residents kick off carnival season at a four-day, rolling party and festival called Washington Mardi Gras. It features tblack-tie balls, business luncheons, panel discussions, political fundraisers and parties sponsored by business groups and lobbyists. 
For years, elected officials have dipped into their campaign accounts to cover their expenses for this event. Elected officials spent a combined $594,000 from their campaign accounts in 2023 alone on Washington Mardi Gras, according to an Illuminator analysis. That came from 64 elected Louisiana officials, including 34 state lawmakers. 

It’s not clear to what extent political funds have been used to cover spending on politician’s spouses and children at Washington Mardi Gras, as Wright’s legislation specifically allows. 

Elected officials’ families often attend the event, but campaign finance reporting isn’t precise enough to give the public those types of details about the expenses. The ethics board’s investigations are also confidential, meaning if they are scrutinizing a particular person’s Washington Mardi Gras spending, it wouldn’t be known to the public. 

But lawmakers have been complaining for months that the ethics board has started looking into Washington Mardi Gras spending more generally. 
“Washington Mardi Gras seems to be getting a lot of attention, and I don’t know why,” said Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, who is cosponsoring the legislation with Wright during a public hearing last year. 

PACs pay for posh events, destinations  
One way Wright’s legislation would accommodate all these proposed new political expenses is by setting up leadership PACs in Louisiana’s campaign finance law. 
At the federal level, a leadership PAC is typically one set up by a member of Congress to give money to other candidates running for office. Wright’s bill would allow for a similar type of organization at the state level. Supporters said it will make it easier for state elected officials to support their colleagues and push their political agendas. 

Government watchdog groups have been highly critical of federal leadership PACs, describing the accounts as “slush funds” that allow members of Congress to spend lavishly at vacation resorts and restaurants. 
Two nonpartisan organizations that promote government accountability, Issue One and the Campaign Legal Center, found less than half of the money Congressional leadership PACs spent during 2019-20 went to their stated purpose of helping other candidates. 

Instead, members of Congress spent significant amounts on lavish resorts, country clubs and restaurants. The leadership PAC spending of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, was held out as an example by the group. 

Paul spent $990,000 from his leadership PAC over 2019-20, but only 12% of those dollars went to other political candidates’ campaigns. Meanwhile, he used the funds for $14,000 in hotel stays and $13,000 at restaurants. He also spent $2,300 on various golf courses and $820 for baseball tickets at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.

“[S]uch spending patterns give the impression that some politicians are simply raising money at one posh location to pay for the next fundraiser at the next fancy destination,” Issue One and the Campaign Legal Center wrote in a report issued in 2021. 

A former congressman, Landry is the person pushing most for the campaign finance law changes contained in Wright’s bill. The governor also stands to benefit the most from more flexibility in political spending because he has far more money in his political accounts than any other state government official.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5C5A7038-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-29 18:10:52.705003

Senate leaders on Thursday realized improper spending of $1.9 million in the Health Department’s budget bill sent over by the House could jeopardize $1.2 billion in federal Medicaid money for Mississippi.
But after it passed the measure Wednesday night — despite having been warned about the problem —  the House went home. It declared its work for a special session to set a state budget done, and the Senate could either concur, or … lump it.
It left the Senate holding the bag.
This left the Senate with some onerous choices: Pass a bill with a known damaging flaw and hope the governor can fix it with a line-item veto, stay in Jackson with senators twiddling their thumbs at taxpayer expense until the House is by law forced to return in three days, or kill the bill. This would leave the Health Department without a state budget as the new budget year looms on July 1, and the governor would have to force lawmakers back into yet another special session to fix it, at taxpayer cost.
As of late Thursday afternoon, the Senate had not taken up the bill. Leaders were reportedly still debating what to do and talking with the governor’s office.
Senators on Thursday plodded through the passage of numerous bills the House had sent over after it pulled an all-nighter and left town. They complained the House had sent numerous jacked-up bills over and then skedaddled, leaving little recourse to fix problems. 
In this case, the problem is the House’s Health Department budget proposal, which allocated $1.9 million to Methodist Rehabilitation Center. This would make the center whole after paying more in provider taxes than it is receiving in directed payments from Medicaid.
But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services deems this improper and says certain entities cannot be exempted in such a way. Provider taxes must be imposed uniformly to meet federal law and CMS regulatory standards. This means the tax must be applied across the board as it relates to similar providers of that type. 
To meet these requirements, states attest they will not refund certain providers and, in essence, hold them harmless from the tax. Providing a special appropriation to reimburse one hospital for the tax they pay appears to violate these requirements, which could jeopardize the provider tax for all hospitals in Mississippi.
Provider taxes, which are helping prop up hospitals in Mississippi without Medicaid expansion, are under extreme scrutiny in Congress right now because of issues like this.
The bill originated in Republican Rep. Clay Deweese’s budget subcommittee. Deweese could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
House Public Health Chairman Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, said he found out about the issue after the bill passed out of committee in the House on Wednesday, before it came before the full House for a vote.
“We were so late in the game when we discovered it, it had already passed through appropriations,” Creekmore said. “It was in Clay’s committee, of course I had some influence over that, but it was Clay’s call to let it ride.”
Neither House Speaker Jason White nor Gov. Tate Reeves on Thursday immediately responded to requests for comment.
Senate leaders on Thursday said they were in communication with the governor’s office and he had assured them he would line-item veto the House’s SNAFU.
In a social media post on Thursday afternoon, Reeves did not mention the health budget error, but he acknowledged had had meeting Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann throughout the day about “concerning” items in some bills. He urged senators to knowingly pass the bills with errors so he could issue a veto and end the special session on Thursday.
“We have identified a few minor items that are concerning in a few – of the over 100 – bills that must be passed,” Reeves said. “I believe it is important that the Senate pass these bills as is to get the Session completed…and I will use my constitutional authority to deal with the concerning items to protect Mississippi citizens, businesses, and taxpayers. The best thing for taxpayers is no doubt for the Special Session to be wrapped up today, and I appreciate everyone working with us to get that accomplished.”
Some senators lamented that setting a budget, controlling the state’s purse strings, is the domain of the Legislature, not the executive branch, and they bristled at the idea of Reeves having to fix problems through vetoes because the House left and refused further parlay.
As Senate debate dragged into the late afternoon on Thursday, senators had different ideas about how the situation would unfold. 
“One senator told me there’d be a line-item veto from the governor, and another senator told me (the House) would be coming back to fix it,” Creekmore said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28160114/3X0A2079.jpg,,,2025-05-29 18:10:52.705003

A recent example is a story by Clark Kauffman, reporter at the Iowa Capital Dispatch. He detailed the allegations in a lawsuit filed by a former certified nurse aide at a nursing home in Fonda, Iowa. The suit was filed against the Fonda Specialty Care nursing home, its parent company, Care Initiatives, and a licensed practical nurse working at the facility. You can read the April 30 story here.
The suit alleges that a certified nurse aide observed an 87-year-old resident with a tracheostomy struggling to breathe. The aide sought help from the on-duty nurse to suction the resident’s airway. The nurse refused to intervene despite multiple requests from staff members. The aide attempted to contact off-site management but could reach no one. She asked for permission to call 911 and was rebuffed. The resident ultimately died in a manner the lawsuit describes as “agonizing and painful.”
The suit also claims that after the certified nurse aide finished her shift, she received multiple text messages from the facility’s administrator to “keep your mouth shut and keep your opinions to yourself.” She was also instructed not to communicate with the family of the resident who died. The next day, the aide was fired. The facility cited “resident complaints” as the reason. The nurse aide said she was fired for reporting the incident to the state.
KTIV television in Sioux City posted Kauffman’s article on their Facebook page, drawing nearly 600 reactions and 200 comments. Responses were candid and often angry. A small sample includes:
“I would never put my parents or anybody I know in a nursing home.”
“The fact that the nursing home tried to cover it up is just as horrible” (as the death).
“My heart breaks for the family and the aides that witnessed it.”
“This makes me sick.”
This makes us sick, too. How about you?
Imagine being in the shoes of the staff member who allegedly tried to do the right thing, witnessed a horrible death, was fired by her employer, and then had to decide “what’s next?”
This nurse’s aide chose not “to keep her mouth shut” but instead to challenge a powerful corporation in court. Some would say that’s a fool’s errand. We view it as an admirable act of courage.
Put this in a larger context. We live in a time where many people, including elected officials, organizations and businesses, find themselves in situations similar to the nurse aide where they are expected to do what they are told and avoid speaking out or acting on what they believe is right.
Here are recent examples: Legislators who don’t vote the way a governor or president demands. The student on campus who speaks up for Palestinians. The university president or corporate head who doesn’t comply with diversity, equity and inclusion directives. National news organizations that write an editorial or airs programs the powers that be don’t like. Foreign leaders who disagree publicly with a U.S. government representative. Law firms that challenge governmental actions. Entertainers who bring attention to social injustices. The list could go on and on.
It’s not a good time to be an independent thinker, to swim against the tide, or to tell the emperor that they have no clothes.
The message to all the rulebreakers out there is this: Toe the line. Do what you’re told. There will be hell to pay if you disobey.
The fact that it’s not a good time to speak out is why we need people to speak out. We applaud the certified nurse aide and all those like her who are courageously standing up for what they believe. They are making what John Lewis called “good trouble.”
Davids can and do defeat the Goliaths. Not all the time, not without great difficulty. But is the fight worth fighting? Indeed, it is.

Faculty members expressed appreciation for Bergh’s leadership, which came at a tumultuous time. Meghan Meacham, a professor and the state university’s program coordinator, said in the release that she credited Bergh with alleviating some of “the growing pains of unification.”Under Bergh’s leadership, the university enrolled more than 1,700 new students in the 2024-25 academic year –– a 14% increase from the year prior. Out-of-state enrollment also rose by 13%, with steady growth projected for the upcoming academic year, according to the release. The Vermont State Colleges System plans to conduct a national search for Bergh’s successor in the coming months, according to a university spokesperson. “Looking ahead, VTSU remains focused on expanding access to public higher education in Vermont and preparing students to lead in a rapidly changing world,” Greta Hasler, the university’s communications director, wrote in an email. “We are committed to building on the strong foundation Dr. Bergh has helped establish.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont State University’s president to retire in 2026.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vermont-state-university-4-20230626.jpg,,,2025-05-29 19:05:33.281004

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Workers building an apartment complex near the Florida State University campus were detained Thursday morning by agents from U.S. Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service, and Florida Highway Patrol. 
After entering a construction site in Tallahassee, federal and state officials asked workers for identification and separated them into two categories, witnesses told the Phoenix.
Some were free to go; others were handcuffed and led onto white buses with metal-covered windows to be transported away from the worksite, escorted by the Highway Patrol. Officials on the scene declined to provide information about the operation.
Construction workers who’d been allowed to leave told the Phoenix that law enforcement officers had surrounded the site on West Gaines Street in FSU’s College Town before the raid began at about 9 a.m.
Agents surrounded dozens of workers in line for the bus.
An ICE public information officer in Tampa told the Phoenix Thursday afternoon: “U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigation served multiple search warrants as part of an ongoing investigation in the Tallahassee region.”
A social media post from Homeland Security Investigations called it a “targeted enforcement operation.”

Homeland Security Investigations Tampa posted on social media that it arrested “more than 100 illegal aliens (some of which were previously deported and others with criminal backgrounds).” Those arrested are from Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia, and Honduras and other countries, the agency said.
Calls to the U.S. attorney and U.S. district court yielded no warrant information. The Leon County Sheriff’s office did not return a call asking whether the detainees were delivered to their detention facility.

Bystanders protesting the raid told agents they should be ashamed of themselves, criticized them for wearing masks, and told them they are all descendants of immigrants. 
Standing with them were workers’ family members, trying to communicate with their loved one who had been detained, asking where they were being transported to.
A man who identified himself as the manager of the construction site told the Phoenix “there’s no information” about the raid. 
Layne Griffith, 22, is a graduate student at FSU who just finished her master’s degree in oceanography. She was packing to leave her apartment in College Town at around 9 a.m. to travel home to Pinellas County when she became aware of a large presence of people in the area.
“So, the state trooper was kind of doing a perimeter check around the apartment buildings itself and I was curious to know what was going on, and I started to notice more of a police presence — people in camo outfits and people in masks and state troopers. I didn’t know what departments they were working for, I couldn’t tell from my apartment,” she said. 
“But I started to see dozens of people at that point in handcuffs getting walked to the opposite side of the construction site and I saw them all lined up behind the prison bus and I stood out there for a while and there were more people showing up and being detained.”
Griffith said she saw law enforcement officers from a variety of agencies: the U.S. Marshals Service; the FBI; and “lots of state troopers.”

Dan McKee has proposed a $10 million budget amendment to open a 21-bed long-term behavioral health unit at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The addition of 21 beds to Our Lady of Fatima Hospital for adults with long-term behavioral health needs would help ease the state’s critical shortage of mental health services, state officials and health care providers agree. 
But it’s unclear if Gov. Dan McKee’s proposal to repurpose $10 million in unspent state and federal funds to do so will rise above other budget demands this year. Also in question: Will a new state investment make the struggling hospital more attractive to investors, and in turn, secure its sale to new owners?
McKee’s office insists his May 27 budget amendment has nothing to do with the not-yet-finalized sale of Fatima and Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence from its now-bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, to new owner The Centurion Foundation. 
The budget proposal was unveiled two days before CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, the local subsidiary formed by Centurion, expected to close on the sale of $140.7 million in tax and tax-exempt bonds, according to Morningstar. The financing is necessary to cover the $80 million capital injection — on top of an $80 million purchase price — for both parties to meet requirements set by the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General and Rhode Island Department of Health.
And the bonds may be a hard sell to potential investors, given the less-than-favorable rating from S&P Global Ratings Agency. The credit ratings on March 25 gave the bonds a BB- rating, which denotes a relatively high risk for a non-investment grade bond. S&P analysts noting “significant uncertainty” surrounding future financial, strategic and operating performance, anticipating a 33% chance of a rating downgrade within a year.
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health, did not return multiple inquiries for comment regarding the bond sale. Bond underwriter Barclay’s also did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday.
‘Catastrophic results’
Lynn Blais, a nurse at Fatima and president of the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents 1,000 CharterCARE employees, is worried.
“If these bonds aren’t sold, there are going to be catastrophic results for health care in Rhode Island,” Blais said in an interview Thursday. 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha also warned of the precarious state of the safety net hospitals, which have been struggling for years due to financial and operational mismanagement under its former private equity ownership.
“When we look at Roger Williams and Fatima, we’re on the edge of a knife there,” Neronha said at a press conference Wednesday. “We’re on the edge of a knife as to whether they survive or not, and if they don’t, there will be one reason why not, because we haven’t acted quickly enough.”
A $10 million boost to Fatima’s existing psychiatric services — which already span 60 beds across three units dedicated to acute, long-term and geriatric care — could help seal the sale deal, assuring investors of a new source of income and the state’s willingness to keep its facilities running, Blais said.

But lawmakers might not be willing to part with $10 million easily given the state’s projected $185 million deficit and the threat of federal funding cuts.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi expressed concern, noting the “challenging budget year,” in a statement Thursday. However, Shekarchi pledged to “reserve judgment” until after an initial hearing before the House Committee on Finance Thursday night.
Senate President Valarie Lawson remained noncommittal on McKee’s proposal, awaiting further legislative review.
“Our Lady of Fatima and Roger Williams Hospitals are critical components of Rhode Island’s health care system, and we will explore all options to support their long-term stability,” Lawson said in a statement.

Filling a shortage 
McKee’s office describes the impetus for his proposal very differently.
“This proposal is neither in response to a request from CharterCare nor is it necessary to sell the CharterCare Bonds,” Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee, said in an emailed response Thursday. “EOHHS have been contemplating ways to support Our Lady of Fatima, including with the behavioral health unit, for years. The State is taking this step because we have unmet needs for patients with significant behavioral health conditions in Rhode Island. The intent of this proposal is to address those needs.”
The new hospital unit, which would fill an empty fourth-floor space, relies on $4.3 million in unspent state funds from the third-quarter of fiscal 2025. The extra money is the result of staffing turnover which reduced budgeted costs in the Rhode Island Department of Human Services, along with a smaller than anticipated state contribution to community and at-home services for older adults. Another $5.7 million in matching federal Medicaid funds, contingent upon not-yet-granted approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, would cover the rest of the $10 million price tag.
The governor’s office referred additional questions to the Rhode Island Office of Executive Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond Thursday.
Blais acknowledged that the state’s psychiatric care services are insufficient.
“We are at capacity every day,” she said of Fatima’s 22-bed long-term psychiatric care unit. 
The state has 112 long-term psychiatric hospital beds, including those at Fatima, according to information provided by the Rhode Island Department of Health. The bulk of them, 78 beds, are through the state-run Eleanor Slater Hospital. There are also 12 beds at Roger Williams Medical Center. 
The number of people waiting for a bed was not immediately available. 
Long-term beds generally are meant for patients who require care for weeks, months or even years in some cases, Randal Edgar, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) said in an email Thursday. Acute psychiatric hospital beds are for patients with “severe, life-threatening conditions” but who “can be stabilized” and may stay up to a week. Edgar said.
Rhode Island ranked 19th among states for the number of beds for adults with severe mental illness per 100,000 residents in 2023, according to a report by the Treatment Advocacy Center. 
Lack of beds forces potential patients to wait weeks for appropriate treatment, often biding their time in hospital emergency rooms, which are ill-equipped to help them with complex psychiatric and co-occurring diagnoses, Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and nurse practitioner, said.
“It’s a horrifying situation,” said Lauria.
The Hospital Association of Rhode Island also expressed preliminary support. 
“Access to long-term behavioral health services is desperately needed for so many Rhode Islanders and we are hopeful that this unit will help alleviate some pressure on the state’s overwhelmed emergency departments,” Howard Dulude, interim president of the hospital association, said in an emailed statement Thursday.
Even McKee’s adversary, Neronha, offered a rare note of praise for the governor.
“The designation of $10 million towards health care in Rhode Island is significant, and for that I tip my hat to the Governor,” Neronha said in a statement Thursday. “Rhode Island leadership needs to come together and do everything we can to support these safety-net hospitals.”
Competing costs 
Neronha stressed the need to address low Medicaid reimbursement rates, which he said are at the root of Roger Williams and Fatima’s financial struggles. 
“We must invest in health care as infrastructure, and that means immediately funding Medicaid to reflect the true cost of care,” Neronha said. “Funding health care is not optional, and we need to design the state budget in a way that reflects health care as our top priority.”
Neronha on Wednesday unveiled a three-pronged strategy including litigation, legislation and a partnership with Brown University to combat the health care crisis. Among his legislative fixes is $50 million worth of Medicaid reimbursement hikes meant to push provider payments level with Medicare. 
A separate pair of bills backed by the Hospital Association requires $90 million to increase Medicaid payments to physicians and advanced practice providers. 
Lauria is leading the charge to reverse the drain of primary care providers as sponsor of a bill proposing a $1 million state scholarship program for doctors, nurse practitioners and physician assistants who stay and work in Rhode Island after graduation. She also co-heads a legislative panel tasked with considering the feasibility of a state medical school.
“There’s a lot of needs out there,” Lauria said. “Finding that balance is going to be key.”
A Senate committee hearing on the governor’s proposed amendment is tentatively scheduled for next week, Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson, said in a text message.

The Minnesota Legislature in even years typically passes an infrastructure package — known as a “bonding bill” around the Capitol because it’s funded with borrowed money — that costs hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars. But partisan tensions appear to have won out this year and killed the bill’s prospects.
Bonding bills require a 60% supermajority in both the House and Senate to pass, meaning it needs robust bipartisan support.
Legislative leaders and Gov. Tim Walz are working to button up budget bills in hopes of convening a special session next week to pass the biennium budget, after failing to complete their work before the constitutionally mandated May 19 adjournment. If lawmakers fail to pass a budget by June 30, the government will shut down.
The DFL-controlled Legislature passed a $2.6 billion infrastructure package in the 2023 session, including $1.5 billion in bonds, following three legislative sessions without an infrastructure deal.
The 2023 package included more than $317 million for upgrades to college buildings in the University of Minnesota and Minnesota State systems, $9 million for security upgrades at the State Capitol and $443 million for economic development initiatives, much of which went to Twin Cities metro nonprofits that assist people of color.
Last year, the Legislature failed to pass a bonding bill. Democrats at the time blamed Republicans for making their necessary votes contingent on Democrats killing the Equal Rights Amendment.
House DFL caucus leader Melissa Hortman on Thursday told reporters that Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, is trying the same tactics this year.
“Johnson has a price tag that includes lots and lots of other things far outside the bonding bill, and so I think he’s going to overplay his hand, exactly as he did in 2024 and there will again not be a bonding bill,” Hortman said, laying the blame on Senate Republicans.
Asked what kinds of demands Johnson is seeking, Hortman said, “He just wants to rewrite every other bill.”
In a statement, Johnson said Democrats refused to compromise. 
“Democrats are the only ones unwilling to work together to pass (a) bonding bill and are playing political blame games to appease their activist base,” Johnson said.
A lack of bonding bill this year could also cost Minnesota more money in the long run. Republicans in Congress are considering eliminating a tax break that lowers the cost of public infrastructure projects across the country, as they try to gather savings to pay for a major tax cut that would especially benefit the wealthy.
If passed, the cost of borrowing for state and local governments would increase, meaning taxpayers would foot the bill.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/infrastructure-1024x698-1.jpg,,,2025-05-29 17:07:36.805980

(Jacob Spudich /The Indiana Daily Student)A federal judge has blocked Indiana University’s “expressive activity” policy, issuing a preliminary injunction against the educational institution’s 2024 rule on Thursday.
Protesters across the country, many of them college students, rallied in support of Palestine near the end of the 2024 school year. At protests on IU’s Bloomington campus, police arrested 57 protesters at a pro-Palestine encampment following a last-minute rule amendment concerning temporary structures in Dunn Meadow that reversed a long-standing policy.
Later that year, in November, the university implemented a new policy that required prior approval for daytime campus protests and banned activities occurring between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana responded by filing suit on behalf of students, faculty members and others who wished to protest against the school in the future.
IU releases review of April protest activity and enforcement

According to the rule, an expressive activity can include protests, speeches, petitions and “all other unapproved conduct and activities otherwise prohibited” by school policy or law. Plaintiffs argued that the new language restricted activity during nighttime hours even if it wasn’t disruptive while university officials maintained that its police department was too short-staffed to allow for overnight protests.
Determining that the case would likely succeed in court and potentially violated the First Amendment, U.S. Southern District of Indiana Judge Richard L. Young ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.
“In sum, the Policy likely burdens substantially more speech than necessary to further the University’s interest in public safety and thus lacks narrow tailoring,” ruled Young.
“IU’s policy would apply to activities such as peaceful candlelight vigils, silently holding a sign, or even wearing a t-shirt that protests world events. The First Amendment does not allow a governmental entity to prohibit all forms of expression during certain hours of the day. We’re pleased that the Court agreed,” said Ken Falk, the ACLU of Indiana’s legal director.

The pace of business on the House and Senate floors noticeably slowed, a consequence of the tradition of unlimited debate that enhances the influence of the Republican minority in the waning days of every session. Simply by talking, the GOP can limit how many — or which — bills are debated.
“Now that time has become a critical element of negotiations, it allows Republicans to leverage influence over the policies that we’re passing,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “It’s important for us to try to be able to get reasonable changes to legislation that we might not like or that we want to see proactively going in a different direction.”
Both chambers scheduled votes for every day through adjournment, except Sunday. Sixty-four House bills awaited final action in the Senate when lawmakers returned Thursday for their daily session. Seventy-eight Senate bills awaited final action in the House.
One of them was Senate Bill 3, the comprehensive consumer protection bill. Among other things, the measure includes a “right-to-repair” provision that would require manufacturers to make available the tools and information needed to repair appliances and electronics that are now tossed, not fixed. 
The requirement would ease the impact of throw-away electronics on the waste stream and save consumers money, said Rep. Gary Turco, D-Newington, who presented and defended the bill as the vice chair of the General Law Committee.
“Right-to-repair” is a national movement that has led to similar legislation, including a bill that became law in Washington state this week. The Pentagon under the Trump administration is trying to make right-to-repair an element of defense contracts.
The bill also would require disclosure of the ability of televisions, smartphones and appliances to eavesdrop on their owners with audio and video links.
Turco said the legislation “comes directly from complaints we’ve heard from consumers or constituents.”
Some Republicans complained that certain elements could place a burden on businesses and drive up costs.
The bill passed on a vote of 112 to 34, with 13 Republicans joining 99 Democrats in support. The Senate voted 25 to 10 to pass it two weeks ago.
The Senate quickly bogged down Thursday over House Bill 7042, a bill that could expose the firearms industry to civil damages for the misuse of firearms in limited  circumstances. Passage was expected Thursday night.
Republicans decried the bill as unfairly holding gun makers and sellers responsible for the actions of purchasers, while the Democratic backers described it as a reasonable effort to make an industry be more attentive to public safety.
The legislation follows a narrow path left open by a federal law that generally protects the gun industry from damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearms or ammunition.
Exceptions to the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act include cases where harms occurred after a manufacturer or seller knowingly violated a law applicable to the sale or marketing of guns.
“There were exemptions placed in it,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, responding to Republican suggestions the law would conflict with federal law.
In fact, the exception regarding the marketing of firearms was used by nine Sandy Hook Elementary School families to sue Remington over its marketing of the AR-15 style rifle used to kill 20 students and six educators in 2012. They agreed to a $73 million settlement in 2022.
The U.S. Supreme Court had refused to hear an appeal of a Connecticut’s court decision that allowed the families to pursue the case.
Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, said the legislation was intended to drive what’s left of the firearms industry out of Connecticut by lawsuits.
“That’s why I think this is a really pernicious bill,” Kissel said. “That’s why I think this is really scary. That’s why I think this is really big government. That’s why I think our legislature, with this legislation, is going way too far.”

(Photo via U.S. Bureau of Prisons)A coalition of legal advocate groups is calling on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to ensure that individuals being held in immigration detention at the Federal Detention Center in Miami (FDC-Miami) are providing access to legal documents, legal mail, and access to counsel, which they say is now not the case.
Attorneys from half of a dozen organizations, including Americans for Immigrant Justice, Florida Legal Services, and the University of Miami Immigration Clinic, claim in a letter sent on Thursday that they have witnessed and documented “troubling systemic failures to provide individuals detained in immigration custody with access to vital legal resources and counsel.”
Specifically, they claim that ICE and BOP have consistently failed to provide those detained at the facility with notices to appear, which the attorneys say are essential to enabling individuals in the immigration enforcement system to understand the charges against them, seek counsel, and prepare their cases.
“ICE and BOP’s denial of access to legal documents, legal mail, and to counsel is unlawful,” the letter reads. “Even the most restrictive version of ICE’s detention standards that govern immigration detention provides that detained individuals must be allowed to retain all their legal documents, or, in instances where they have a large amount of documents, which must be kept in storage, access within 24 hours to such materials.”
The Federal Detention Center in Miami is holding about 400 people for alleged immigration violations, according to Reason.com. Many of those detainees have been transferred from the Krome North Detention Center, another ICE facility based in Miami that’s been accused of overcrowding, with people sleeping on floors, poor sanitation, and two detainee deaths earlier this year.
The state of Florida leads the nation in the number of 287(g) partnerships. Those are agreements that authorize ICE to delegate specified immigration officer functions to state and local enforcement officials that are taking place across the state.

( Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today)Three weeks after a medical biller announced it would no longer be working with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi, moms in the state face out-of-pocket costs of over $100 per session for breastfeeding help – and are calling on lawmakers and the state’s largest private insurer to step up.
Although Blue Cross has always restricted which lactation consultants it considers in-network – generally only covering services in hospitals provided directly after birth – moms with Blue Cross insurance previously had a workaround. A third party biller called The Lactation Network (TLN), which contracts with lactation consultants, covered the costs for women with the insurance.
However, on April 30, TLN sent out a letter to consultants saying their organization was not being reimbursed by insurance companies and could not afford to continue fronting the money to cover moms with certain health insurance – including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama.
TLN did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today.
“You’re sitting there like: I’ve got to feed my baby, and something’s not right, and I can’t get help,” said Patience Pierini, a Gulfport mom of two. “… If, more than anything, people need nourishment, why is this not being covered?”
  Erin Mattingly, a lactation consultant and birth doula, examines 1-month-old Maverick Saxton while speaking with his mother, Christie Saxton, at Erin Mattingly Birth Services in Madison, Miss., Thursday, May 22, 2025.

The recent development has prompted moms and lactation consultants to ask why Blue Cross never covered these services directly in the first place – which nurse practitioner and lactation consultant Laken Miller called “even worse” than dropping the coverage.
“We didn’t know before that the Lactation Network was just bridging the gap, and understandably, it was a cost that they couldn’t continue to absorb,” said Miller, who is an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) – the highest form of accreditation in lactation care – in Laurel.
The only in-network lactation consultants currently covered by Blue Cross in Mississippi are physicians, who do not generally operate outpatient clinics focused solely on breastfeeding care. But there’s nothing stopping the insurance company from working with non-MD lactation consultants, explained Marsha Walker, president of the National Lactation Consultant Alliance.
Blue Cross operates independently in each state, and the restrictions on lactation services vary significantly. In Tennessee, they are slightly more lax than Mississippi, with the insurance company working with certified lactation consultants who also have nursing degrees, two consultants told Mississippi Today.
Blue Cross also did not respond to questions from Mississippi Today about why it does not cover non-physician lactation care in Mississippi or if it has plans to in the future.
Insurance companies are required by federal law to cover breastfeeding support, counseling and equipment. But they’ve been allowed to meet this requirement while offering limited access to few providers, or only covering virtual consultations, explained Walker, who is also a registered nurse and IBCLC.

“The (Affordable Care Act) does say that breastfeeding counseling needs to be covered, but it doesn’t say how – and that’s the problem,” Walker said. “It’s general in scope, leaving it up to the insurers to figure out how to adhere to that.”
There were 97 IBCLCs in the state in 2023, but the vast majority of those work in hospitals and provide support to mothers during their stay following birth – which is typically long before mature milk comes in and various breastfeeding problems surface, Miller, the lactation consultant and nurse practitioner, explained.
Miller said she only knows of four IBCLCs besides herself working outside of hospitals in the state.
Last week, Miller and her colleagues sent a letter to state lawmakers asking that the Legislature ensure insurance companies are adequately fulfilling their obligation under the ACA to cover lactation care.
“We recognize that BCBS supports breastfeeding … However, the reality is that thousands of mothers in Mississippi will no longer have access to no-cost lactation services from private practice IBCLCs due to no available in-network or out-of-network providers,” the letter read.
Covering lactation services yields a huge return on investment for insurance companies, explained Walker, if it prevents even one infant’s stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for a condition like necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a severe gastrointestinal condition in premature infants that is made more likely by a diet of formula.
“If you do not cover breastfeeding, it comes back to haunt you later on with the increased amount of money they’re going to spend on diseases and conditions that are preventable by breastfeeding,” Walker said.
One study estimated each baby who is breastfed for three months saves private insurance companies $750 compared to those who are never breastfed.
For new moms, whether they have access to timely care will make or break their decision to breastfeed, explained Erin Mattingly, a Jackson-based IBCLC who also signed the legislative letter.
“When parents run into trouble in that 10-day to two-week period, if they don’t have access to help, the vast majority of them will quit breastfeeding,” Mattingly said. “Because it’s very difficult to push through a situation that feels dire when you are postpartum and recovering from a birth and learning a new baby.”

Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday unveiled Rapoza as his pick to serve on the Rhode Island Board of Elections’ board of directors. If confirmed by the Rhode Island Senate, Rapoza will fill the $5,100-a-year seat soon to be vacated by board member Diane Mederos, whose term expires June 1. Mederos did not want to be reappointed, Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email Thursday.
Raposa retired as the elections board executive director on March 31, 2024, after a nearly three-decade career with the state elections agency in which he served multiple roles.
Miguel Nunez, the former deputy elections director, was picked by the board to replace Rapoza as executive director following a nationwide search.
“Bob’s experience and understanding of our state’s elections system makes him a strong candidate for this role,” McKee said in a statement. “Protecting the integrity of our elections is essential to our democracy, and I’m confident Bob’s extensive knowledge of election laws, policies and procedures will help further the Board’s work to build public trust in our electoral process.”
The Rhode Island Senate has not yet scheduled a vote on Rapoza’s nomination, Greg Pare said Thursday. 
If approved, Rapoza will serve a nine-year term. 
Rapoza began working for the Rhode Island Board of Elections in 1997 as its special projects coordinator, developing the plan to use optical scan voting equipment statewide. He served as executive director for the final six years of his tenure with the agency, running elections across the state’s 461 voting precincts alongside reviewing changes to state elections laws and working with local, state and federal agencies on election integrity.
“Knowing the inner workings of the election process will complement the existing board as together, we will continue the board’s mission for fair, accurate, and efficient elections,” Rapoza said in a statement.
He has a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of New Haven and was certified as an elections and registration administrator through Auburn University.

(Pool photo by Eli Lucero/Herald Journal)Amid a week of high-profile pardons, the Trump administration pardoned Kentrell Gaulden, widely known for his stage name NBA YoungBoy, on Wednesday, months after his conviction in Utah on gun-related charges.
The 25-year-old rapper’s case had been transferred from Louisiana to Utah, where he has lived in recent years. In an agreement resolving two sets of federal charges, he was sentenced to almost two years in prison. After being released from home confinement, he began serving 60 months of probation and paid a $200,000 fine after pleading guilty to possessing a firearm while being a convicted felon.
“I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building — as a man, as a father, and as an artist,” Gaulden said in a social media post. “This moment means a lot. It opens the door to a future I’ve worked hard for and I am fully prepared to step into this.”

White House Pardon Czar Alice Marie Johnson told Fox & Friends that while reviewing Gaulden’s case, she took into consideration his age, his circumstances growing up in an impoverished neighborhood, and the conditions of his case’s investigation.
“Most of those were gun charges without the guns being discharged,” she said, also adding that the investigation emerged from a set where Gaulden was filming a video with a prop.
“The officers who in this particular case, they came at him as though he was a terrorist, and he was on the set filming for a video. They gave him a gun charge for that,” Johnson said. “And we found that the officers who did this were all investigated and fired.”
Three Baton Rouge officers were fired and one resigned in September 2024 in the middle of a criminal investigation “for allegedly covering up evidence of one officer beating a detainee during a strip search in 2020,” in a confrontation after Gaulden was arrested, according to The Advocate.

Johnson announced that 26 individuals had been granted clemency on Wednesday.  
“Each one represents a story of redemption, rehabilitation, and resilience,” she wrote on X. “Their second chance is a second shot at life.”
Prior to that firearm sentence, Gaulden was booked into the Cache County Jail in April 2024 and charged with identity fraud, forgery, prescription fraud and possession of a firearm as a convicted felon after “being identified as a suspect in a large scale prescription fraud ring,” according to court documents.
Gaulden was also convicted of aggravated assault with a firearm, a felony, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2016 and was also arrested in Georgia for aggravated assault and kidnapping in 2018, according to court files.
In 2021, the FBI also arrested Gaulden for possessing a weapon as a convicted felon. At that time, his federal charges were still pending in a Louisiana court and he was on federal pre-trial supervision.

He has volunteered with numerous local organizations, including efforts aimed at improving healthcare accessibility, supporting youth programs, and promoting economic development in Great Falls and surrounding areas, according to the press release.
“This is an exciting opportunity to move from crafting policy to driving meaningful change in the healthcare system itself. For more than 14 years, I’ve worked hard on a variety of healthcare policy issues because I have seen firsthand the importance of healthcare to our neighbors, our communities and our local economies. While the MHA is actively involved in the healthcare policy space, it also supports our state’s hospitals by providing quality improvement, safety, workforce development, emergency preparedness and other programs that enhance care in rural and frontier communities. I am deeply committed to applying both my legislative and business experience to build a stronger future for all Montanans who rely on the care our healthcare system provides,” Buttrey said.
Buttrey will succeed Robert W. “Bob” Olsen, who has served in leadership positions for the Association since 1989 and has led the organization as president and CEO since 2022. During the course of his more than 30-year career with the association,  Olsen has made significant contributions to federal and state regulatory, policy and advocacy matters. He was awarded the MHA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2022 and the Frederick C. Morgan Individual Achievement Award from the Healthcare Financial Management Association in 2025.
“I’ve witnessed significant changes in Montana’s healthcare system during that time, yet one constant has remained: The need to adapt. Montana patients and healthcare providers will be well served by Ed’s innovative approaches, ability to bring together diverse stakeholders, and a longstanding commitment to improving healthcare for our state,” Olsen said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-29-at-2.27.48 PM-1024x582.png,,,2025-05-29 17:07:36.805980

Thursday’s announcement from Dorchester County follows a 2,700-acre purchase in Jasper County two weeks ago by the Nature Conservancy that was expected to become the first new state forest in 20 years.
The Open Space Institute closed last week on its $11.35 million purchase of land called Beech Hill in Dorchester County, located between the Edisto River Wildlife Management Area and Givhans Ferry State Park, about 12 miles west of the fast-growing town of Summerville.
The organization, in a statement, described the property as “unusually high and dry for the Lowcountry,” putting it in higher demand for potential development as growth moves northwest out of Charleston.
According to the Open Space Institute, it will be open to the public with for hunting, hiking and biking.
“This forested landscape represents a renewable resource that provides a multitude of benefits, including clean water, scenic beauty, wildlife habitat and outdoor recreation,” State Forester Scott Phillips said in a statement.
“This is another win for our state, its residents, and wildlife as we continue working with our partners to ramp up efforts to conserve working forests.”

The land was previously used by WestRock to grow trees for its now-shuttered North Charleston paper mill.
The purchase includes funding from the Forestry Commission and the South Carolina Conservation Bank, as well as Dorchester County, which will contribute $4.1 million from its Greenbelt Program. County voters approved a 1-cent local sales tax for conservation in 2022.
Management of South Carolina’s protected forests is funded through timber sales on the properties, according to the Forestry Commission’s website.
A quarter of revenue earned from the new forest will go to the Dorchester County School District, according to information provided by the Open Space Institute.
The Nature Conservancy bought the Jasper County property, known as Chelsea Plantation, for $32 million. Originally nearly 6,000 acres, other parts of the tract had already been sold to home builders.
Jasper County property could become SC’s first new state forest in 20 years

“Developing Chelsea would have ushered in a new era of expansion in an already fast-growing region,” executive director Dale Threatt-Taylor said in a statement. “We weren’t willing to leave it to chance.”
The timeline for transferring that property to the state is still being discussed.
Before these two announcements, the last time land opened to the public as a new, protected state forest was in 2004, when the Forestry Commission acquired 12,000-acre Wee Tee State Forest in Williamsburg and Georgetown counties.
Conservation groups helped purchase land to add to the forest in 2023, bringing its total to 18,000 acres.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-29 17:07:36.805980

U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich is calling on Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to say which national parks the agency wishes to transfer to states or municipalities. (Photo by the National Park Service)United States Interior Secretary Doug Burgum recently testified that his agency is eying about 400 national parks for possible transfer to states or localities, but he has not yet detailed which ones the agency wishes to get rid of.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) on Thursday re-upped his call for Burgum to release that list, sending the secretary a letter demanding explanations for how the agency is making these decisions as it simultaneously seeks to cut 30% of its operating budget. 
Heinrich’s letter also says that only Congress has the authority to transfer national parks “in most circumstances,” so he expressed his opposition, as ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to the transfer of any national park.
According to Heinrich’s letter, President Donald Trump’s plan for the Interior Department would cut $900 million from its budget. But Heinrich defended national parks as, among other things, “engines of economic growth,” as visitors to national parks contributed about $56 billion to the economy in 2023 and supported more than 400,000 jobs.

Burgum testified that the agency is not seeking to get rid of any of the nation’s 64 “crown jewel” national parks, but that some of the more than 400 other NPS sites could be managed by state or local authorities.
Heinrich noted that states often don’t have adequate resources to adequately manage the parks that are now under federal control, parks that he said accomplish important conservation and other objectives and “tell the complex story of our nation.”
“The budget proposal makes clear that the administration expects the states to shoulder the burden of managing these sites without any additional funding or resources, many of which have significant and costly deferred maintenance backlogs.”
In previous committee testimony, Heinrich pointed to the Valles Caldera National Preserve as an example of a park that isn’t a “big-P national park” but still “incredibly important parts of our National Park System, our history and our culture.”

Free.,Ethics investigation into Florida U.S. House Democrat ongoing,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ethics-investigation-florida-us-house-democrat-ongoing,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House Ethics Committee on Thursday released a report from the Office of Congressional Ethics that provides more details about why an investigation into Florida Democratic Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick remains ongoing.Cherfilus-McCormick, who has represented the state’s 20th Congressional District for about three years, didn’t deny the allegations she may have violated campaign finance laws and House rules, but said in a statement she would work with the panel as its investigation continues.“The Committee on Ethics has not yet concluded its review of the allegations, and no decision has been made at this time,” Cherfilus-McCormick said. “As outlined in the Committee’s public statement, the referral for further review does not imply that any violation has occurred. I fully respect the process and remain committed to cooperating with the Committee as it works to bring this inquiry to a close.""A press release from the Ethics Committee said releasing the Office of Congressional Ethics report was required by House rules since the investigative subcommittee looking into the matter hadn’t reached a conclusion after one year.“The Committee notes that the mere fact of a continued investigation into these allegations does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred,” the press release states. “No other public comment will be made on this matter except in accordance with Committee rules.”The three-page report from the Office of Congressional Ethics — now known as the Office of Congressional Conduct — says that Cherfilus-McCormick might have requested earmarked funding for a for-profit entity in violation of House rules.“Representative Cherfilus-McCormick may have dispensed special favors or privileges to friends in connection with her congressional office’s requests for community project funding,” the report states. “If Representative Cherfilus-McCormick dispensed special favors or privileges to friends in connection with her congressional office’s requests for community project funding, she may have violated House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.”Cherfilus-McCormick also “may have accepted campaign contributions linked to an official action” and “her campaign may have accepted and failed to report in-kind contributions that may have exceeded applicable limits,” according to the report.“Representative Cherfilus-McCormick’s campaign may have misreported the source of a campaign contribution or accepted a campaign contribution made by one person in the name of another,” the report states. “If Representative Cherfilus-McCormick’s campaign misreported the source of a campaign contribution or accepted a campaign contribution made by one person in the name of another, she may have violated House rules, standards of conduct, and federal law.”Earmark, campaign finance irregularitiesThe House Ethics Committee originally voted in December 2023 to form an investigative subcommittee to look into allegations that Cherfilus-McCormick “may have violated campaign finance laws and regulations in connection with her 2022 special election and/or 2022 re-election campaigns; failed to properly disclose required information on statements required to be filed with the House; and/or accepted voluntary services for official work from an individual not employed in her congressional office.”New York Republican Rep. Andrew R. Garbarino was named chair of that panel and Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan was named ranking member. Oregon Republican Rep. Cliff Bentz and Louisiana Democratic Rep. Troy Carter were named as members of the subcommittee.The Ethics Committee expanded its investigation into Cherfilus-McCormick in June 2024, saying it would look into whether the congresswoman “engaged in improper conduct in connection with community project funding requests; (2) misused official funds for campaign purposes; and/or (3) violated campaign finance laws and regulations in connection with her 2024 re-election campaign.”In September 2024, the Ethics Committee released an earlier Office of Congressional Ethics report into Cherfilus-McCormick.That two-page report, dated one year prior, alleged Cherfilus-McCormick “made payments to a state political action committee that may have been in connection with her campaign for federal office.”It also said Cherfilus-McCormick’s “campaign committee may have accepted and failed to report contributions exceeding FEC contribution limits” and that her “campaign committee may have failed to report transactions between the campaign committee’s bank account and Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick’s businesses’ bank accounts.”The Washington Post reported in January that Florida was suing the health care firm that Cherfilus-McCormick once ran, alleging the state’s Division of Emergency Management paid more than $5 million for Trinity Health Care Services to register people for coronavirus vaccines, instead of the correct amount of around $50,000.Cherfilus-McCormick’s financial disclosure form for that year shows her income increased by about $6 million, according to the Washington Post report.Cherfilus-McCormick then loaned her congressional campaign more than $6 million between Jan. 1, 2021, and Dec. 31, 2022, according to the Washington Post report.",,,,2025-05-29 17:07:36.805980

(Getty Images)A public school budget expert told New Mexico lawmakers on Thursday that the federal government is likely to take away money meant for students who are learning English, but said a new state law will help compensate for the loss.
Legislative Education Study Committee Senior Fiscal Analyst Daniel Estupiñan said the federal funding for K-12 public education most at risk of being cut is meant for students who are English language learners and their teachers, called Title III, because the Trump administration has “mostly hollowed out” the Office of English Language Acquisition, which ensured states and schools properly spent Title III money, and has recommended terminating its funding source. The office had just one staffer remaining as of March 21, Chalkbeat reported.
“So many nonprofits, so many other states, are basically going into a panic,” Estupiñan told the committee. “They’re panicking about their public school funding formulas not being responsive enough to potentially support English learners, to potentially support low-income students and support professional development in basic programs.”
Overall, New Mexico will receive more than $633 million from the U.S. Department of Education for K-12 public education this year, according to estimates included in Estupiñan’s presentation to the committee.
The Trump administration’s preliminary budget proposal proposed keeping the same level of funding for low-income students and students with disabilities, while also cutting $4.5 billion in the various “formula awards” that go to public schools, according to Estupiñan’s presentation.
Estupiñan said the proposal calls for redesigning the federal funding scheme for K-12 schools, and changing to a block grant system in which states would receive one large pot of money without as many rules governing how to spend it.
How much money the federal government actually provides to schools will depend on the final budget passed by Congress.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

If left untouched, New Mexico may receive $4.7 million in English language learning funds that can pay for teacher training, family engagement and instructional materials, Estupiñan said.
Estupiñan said the state could, however, navigate losing federal funding as a result of House Bill 63, which reduces the state’s reliance on federal data.
Instead, starting on July 1, New Mexico’s funding formula for English learners will use state income tax data, public benefits data and U.S. Census Bureau data.
“So we’re not completely independent from federal data, but we’re moving in the direction of basically data autonomy,” Estupiñan said.
That change will result in about $125 million flowing to districts and charter schools, and that money can be used to backfill a potential cut, he said.
HB63 also created the first guidance New Mexico has ever had for how money should be used to specifically support English learners, he said.
“So if we see the elimination of Title III funding, or we see some revocation of federal protections through rule or statute for English learners, we now have a good foundation in state statute to build on,” Estupiñan said.

In the evenings, tourists make their way across the avenue from the French Quarter, drinks in hand, ready to take in some jazz at the clubs on Frenchman Street.
These visitors — or the current residents, for that matter — have little reason to give any thought to what once happened here in centuries past. The streetscape then could have included a cortege of enslaved Black people being forced-marched in chains from far away or from ships at the nearby docks or unloaded from wagons, all to be delivered to what amounted to urban prison camps.
Before the Civil War, the blocks on and surrounding Esplanade Avenue were home to dozens of slave pens, stockyard-like enclosures of dirt lots surrounded by high brick walls to deter escape and shield public view. Inside were men, women, and children warehoused until they could be sold, either directly from the pens or on the auction blocks somewhere in the prosperous city of New Orleans.
The pens were “foul places, attractive to flies and lice and vermin, hazy with acrid smoke from cheap pork cooked over open flames, and reeking of sweat and urine and feces and garbage,” historian Joshua D. Rothman said in his book “The Ledger and the Chain: How Domestic Slave Traders Shaped America.”
It was the stench and health concerns — not the inhumanity of the slave trade itself — that had prompted Quarter residents to push for the pens to be moved away from their fine homes into the neighborhoods along Esplanade.
The prisoners, many torn from family and friends and forced to walk or endure ship passage for hundreds of miles from the Upper South to serve new masters, were crowded inside by overseers concerned only with keeping them healthy and fit enough to bring top dollar on the market.
Passersby “might hear the cries of small children” or “the muted anguish of adults who are there, who are suffering what we call today PTSD or some sort of traumatic injury, who are trying to wrap their heads around what’s happening,” Calvin Schermerhorn, history professor at Arizona State University said in an interview.
  Slave traders often dressed up enslaved people and provided other cosmetic care when bringing them to auction. This magazine illustration titled, “Slaves For Sale: A Scene In New Orleans,” shows a group of Black men, women and children standing alongside a building beneath a sign reading “T. Hart Slaves.” The engraving is from the early 1860s. (Credit: From the Historic New Orleans Collection; gift of Mr. George Denègre)
An alert visitor can find a historical marker on the neutral ground near Esplanade Avenue and Chartres Street, marking the city’s connection to the brutal slave trade. Another marker across the intersection toward the river marks the location of the infamous slave pens where Solomon Northup, known for  “Twelve Years a Slave,” was sold into slavery.
“There’s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever,” Northup said in his 1853 memoir of his life as a free man sold into slavery. “There will be reckoning yet … It may be sooner or it may be later, but it’s a coming as sure as the Lord is just.”
That accounting has yet to fully come to a city more associated with letting the good times roll than dealing with past sins.
Outside of historians, academics and the generational memories of Black New Orleanians, relatively few people understand the enormity of New Orleans’ involvement in the slave trade, which helped build generational wealth for white residents and made the city the most financially powerful and influential in the South.
Gregg Kimball, Senior Consulting Historian for the Shockoe Institute in Richmond, Va., maintains that the slave trade was part of the 19th century U.S. economic boom “that really made the United States a world power. It basically created American capitalism. That’s a big deal. Right?’”
For New Orleans, sugar and slaves were the driving forces for an economy that also thrived from the global cotton trade and its position at the mouth of the Mississippi River.
“It’s those three intertwined. It’s New Orleans’s status as not only a port city, but as a place where banking is based and where trading happens in sugar and cotton and slaves,” New Orleans historian Erin Greenwald said.

Slavery is in the very bones of New Orleans, where the essential protective levees, streets and core buildings were constructed by enslaved workers. Captive Black laborers helped grow and harvest the lucrative sugar and cotton crops, loaded the yield onto the ships for export and even served as collateral for plantation owners’ bank loans to expand their land holdings and buy more enslaved workers.
From the early 1800s until Union Troops occupied the city about a year after the beginning of the Civil War, New Orleans was known as the “slave market of the South.” An estimated 135,000 people were bought and sold in the city and its immediate environs at more than 50 documented places.
These are the same places where residents and tourists today celebrate Mardi Gras, sleep in luxury hotels, drink in dive bars, and eat at fine restaurants. In 2025, there is little public acknowledgement of the atrocities of slavery beyond a few mostly low-key historical markers and some local tours designed to go beyond the usual sightseeing fare.
The history of how slavery made New Orleans the city it is today rarely intrudes on the daily awareness of most people.
Greenwald said she values what she gets from reading academic histories.
“It’s great. But that’s not what’s going to penetrate the consciousness,” she said. “It’s just not. It’s expensive, it’s jargony. … Historians are speaking generally to each other. You have to have a lot of prior knowledge to access a lot of the narrative in academic history.”
  New Orleans history tour guide David Higgins traces his ancestry to a great-great-great-grandmother who he said was a slave in the French Quarter and mistress to a Dutch slave trader. When he gives an African American history tour, Higgins said, “most people are interested in hearing about progressive things that happened after slavery,” like New Orleans native Homer Plessy and his unsuccessful fight against Louisiana’s racial segregation laws in the late 1800s. (Ben Estes/Verite News)
There is also the city’s reluctance to confront its painful past, focusing instead on tourism-friendly narratives and laissez les bons temps rouler marketing.
“There’s a powerful impulse to keep slavery in the rearview mirror, to present a story about the United States that is one of progress and improvement,” Rothman, chair of the history department at the University of Alabama, said in an interview. “People like to think slavery was terrible, but we fixed it. In fact, we’ve forgotten about it.”
To those who know, the city’s slave history is everywhere: former slave quarters operating as apartments and short-term rentals, historic structures built with slave labor and a culture of music and art that wouldn’t exist without the influence and contributions of enslaved residents. But it isn’t easy to track down the markers, read the academic research and all the other things that provide a thorough understanding of what happened.
In an upcoming series of articles, Verite News hopes to make the city’s connection to slavery better known and understood by residents who are not familiar with stories and connections held dear by descendants of the enslaved and to the millions who come to visit “the city that care forgot.”
The historical marker for the St. Louis Hotel, the most famous slave auction site in New Orleans, is placed at the back of the luxurious Omni Royal Orleans hotel, next to a loading dock. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people walk past it each day without pausing to read about what took place there.
The marker itself seems to downplay the connection to the slave market and its inhumanity. “The luxurious St. Louis Hotel included a bank, ballroom, shopping arcade, and trading exchange,” the marker boasts. “Six days a week, under the hotel’s domed rotunda, auctioneers sold land and goods,” before what almost seems like an aside of  “as well as thousands of enslaved people.”
Slavery-related markers on The Moonwalk by the Mississippi River, The Merieult House on Royal Street, The Cabildo in Jackson Square, slave pen locations at Esplanade and Chartres, the New Orleans Slave Depot at Common and Baronne streets, and Congo Square are also easy to overlook.

And even for those who do stop and read, the official city guidance and literature provides little context for what it means and what the reader should think or do about it. While other cities around the world have benefited from building museums, permanent exhibits, and other educational structures on painful events, including the Holocaust, race massacres, and the atrocities and injustices of the Jim Crow era, New Orleans has mostly remained on the sidelines.
The removal of Confederate monuments from prominent positions in the city sparked a great outcry in 2017 from those who said they saw it as “erasing history,” but the recognition of enslaved people’s contributions to building and molding New Orleans has not received similar support.
“There had been this resistance, I think, in New Orleans generally to recognizing darker sides of history that complicate the fun-time celebration, exotic nature tourism of the city,” said Greenwald, who put together “Purchased Lives,” an extensive exhibit on slavery that was on display at The Historic New Orleans Collection in 2015. “New Orleans is not alone in that, but they might be one of the worst examples of covering up things that aren’t part of their tourism narrative, and that has changed.”
Many of the slave markers were placed by a city commission appointed to mark the New Orleans Tricentennial in 2018. Freddi Evans, a New Orleans author and educator who was on the commission, said in an interview that the markers have had a positive effect.
“Well, I don’t know if it has an impact on the people who are coming here as tourists, but it has an impact on the people who are here, the citizens,” she said, including the descendants of enslaved people who have taken it upon themselves to keep their history from being erased. The New Orleans Tricentennial Commission does offer a slave marker tour app that provides “an immersive and dramatic self-guided tour of sites that played an important role in the domestic slave trade of New Orleans.”
  Each year, over the July 4 weekend, the New Orleans MAAFA Commemoration provides a community remembrance event “to reckon with the horrors of the Transatlantic and Domestic Slave Trades, and a release from the chains of its legacy.” Sponsored by the Ashé Cultural Arts Center, the event includes participants wearing white making a journey from Congo Square with stops at the Esplanade site, the Tomb of the Unknown Slave – pictured here, next to St. Augustine Catholic Church on Governor Nicholls Street – and other locations.

“Hundreds of people come,” Evans said. It’s one way the city can memorialize those who suffered under slavery.
Harvard historian Walter Johnson has written that the whole city should be considered a memorial to slavery.
“The levee is a slave-built levee. The entire economic development of the city was premised upon slavery. All the buildings were built by enslaved people or free people of color,” Johnson told The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2017.
“You could memorialize the city of New Orleans with a million markers of which enslaved people lived there, which enslaved people worked there, which enslaved people built this.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/St.-Louis-Hotel-auction-block-1024x739.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-29 20:00:25+00:00,CT Mirror,CT mobile home protections bill stalls over rent caps sticking point,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/ct-mobile-home-rent-caps-bill/,Lawmakers declined to vote on a bill that would strengthen mobile home owner protections over opposition to a rent caps proposal within it.,"The Connecticut House of Representatives on Wednesday spent hours debating a bill that would strengthen protections for mobile and manufactured home owners, many of whom are seniors, but decided to stop the discussion in the face of Republican opposition.
The sticking point — even in a limited capacity — was a proposal to create a rent cap.
Mobile home owners typically own their homes, but not the land they sit on. Residents pay rent to the park owner on the land. House Bill 5428 would limit annual rent increases to 2% of rent plus any increases in the annual consumer price index and provide a process for park owners to appeal that limit in particular cases.
Rent caps were in the political spotlight in 2023 when a proposal to cap rents at apartments and mobile homes came before the Housing Committee. The public hearing drew hundreds of speakers and broad support from tenants.
The measure faced fierce opposition from landlords who said it would have limited their ability to compensate for increased costs, and the proposal was stripped from the bill before it got a vote in committee.
Republicans opposed it as well, saying it interfered with landlords’ rights and the free market. Some moderate Democrats weren’t sure about the measure, and it ultimately failed. Two years later, the mobile home bill, which would affect a much smaller segment of the population, likely has a tough path forward.
“I think the big concern was the whole notion of restricting how much of an increase can happen with rent, and that’s always been a concern,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, Thursday morning. “It was a concern from the beginning of session with that particular bill, but because it was specific to mobile homes, some people felt that it was a bit different than your typical residential unit that might get rented.”
After about five hours, Democrats pulled the bill from debate in a move called “pass temporarily,” which is used typically to answer a question, amend a bill or end long debate.
“It was clearly getting talked, and it was going to continue to get talked,” Rojas said, adding that he was always open to a bill coming back after being passed temporarily. But, he said, he talked with Republicans and couldn’t find a path forward.
Supporters said Wednesday that the bill would help control costs and ensure seniors could stay in their homes as well as add transparency about fees.
“Residents living in manufactured mobile home parks have unusual circumstances,” said Rep. Rebecca Martinez, D-Plainville, the bill’s proponent. “One of their circumstances is that mobile homes are not actually that mobile. It costs a lot of money for one to move their home — upwards of $20,000. Due to the fact that there haven’t been that many parks built over the last 20 years, it leaves them not many places to go.”
Republicans said the measure would interfere in park owners’ property rights and guarantee that they’d raise rents by the maximum amount every year, even in years they might not have otherwise increased rent.
“Let’s just face it. This is a rent cap, rent control,” said Rep. Steve Weir, R-Hebron. “Nowhere in history have rent caps led to more housing, better housing conditions, better living conditions for the residents. What it’s resulted in is less investments, fewer investors, fewer improvements made to the property.”
The House proposal would also limit ancillary fees such as pet fees or fees to have a washer and dryer in a home to $15, require park owners to disclose those fees ahead of time, and increase relocation payments for residents from $10,000 to $20,000 if the owner sells the park with the intent to turn it into something else, among other measures.
It would also require that park owners test the power of fire hydrants on their properties and report the results to fire marshals, a measure added in the wake of two fires at parks in Danbury that were difficult to control because the hydrants didn’t have enough water pressure.
In recent years there has been a push from homeowners to get legislation passed that would limit rent increases and address other quality of life and safety concerns at mobile home parks.
The parks are typically occupied by people 55 years and older and are a lower cost way to buy a home. But those costs have gone up nationwide in recent years as more investor-backed companies purchase parks.
In 2023, Connecticut lawmakers passed a law that aimed to make it easier for residents to buy their parks. If a property goes up for sale, resident associations must be offered the chance to match any offers and purchase their park.
But residents have said owners have found ways around that law by creating complicated purchasing structures or selling the parks as part of a package of several properties.
Republicans said Wednesday that there were things in the bill they liked, particularly the sections to do with fire prevention and public safety.
But, they said, they couldn’t get past the rent caps.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4443-1024x895.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

“The U.S. will begin revoking visas of Chinese students,” read a post on the social media platform X by Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday afternoon.
Along with the post on “X”, the U.S. Department of State released a press statement in which Rubio specified that “under President Trump’s leadership,” Chinese students’ visas will be “aggressively” revoked, including those “with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”
“We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong,” the statement concluded.
The revocation threats came shortly after the U.S. government decided to halt new student visa interviews for foreign applicants to U.S. colleges, where they plan to use the review of social media activity as a filter.
A week ago, during a U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee meeting, Rubio stated that “visas are a privilege, not a right.” As of that moment, there was no exact count of how many visas had been revoked; it could be thousands, and, according to him, they “probably have more to do.”
These actions came as part of an escalation in the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration against both the international student community and the Chinese government.
Since early spring, several hundred visas and SEVIS records of foreign students have been revoked indiscriminately and without explanation at universities across the country. Chinese students were among those.
In Michigan, dozens of international students were affected by this policy, and although some of them had their visa records restored days later, the uncertainty about their future remained latent. The nationalities of the students whose visas and SEVIS records were revoked were never officially confirmed.
Around the country, several foreign students, Chinese citizens among them, started suing the current administration to have their visas and SEVIS records restored. A Chinese doctoral student from MSU sued the Trump administration to have his status reinstated.
On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning addressed the new actions taken by the Trump administration during a press conference. Regarding the tense situation surrounding student visas, Ning responded to a question from Bloomberg, stating that this unjustified decision uses national security as a pretext.
“It seriously hurts the lawful rights and interests of international students from China, and disrupts people-to-people exchanges between the two countries. China firmly opposes it and has protested to the U.S. over the decision,” Ning said.
Even though tensions between Chinese university students in Michigan and the U.S. government can be traced back to shortly before Trump began his second term, the latest statement from the federal government specifically targets them, exposing them all to uncertainty.
Five Chinese University of Michigan alumni were charged last October with misleading U.S. authorities following an FBI investigation into their activities around the Camp Grayling National Guard base. Although it was unclear whether the students were arrested, the case sparked national security concerns.
Among undergraduates and graduates, Chinese students are the largest majority within the international student community. Michigan colleges and universities house thousands of Chinese students per year under the F1, J1, or M1 visas, which include regular students, researchers, and vocational trainees.
At Michigan State University (MSU) alone, Chinese students make up the majority of the international student population, with a total of 1,016 students, according to the Geographical Sources of Students report from the Spring semester of this year. At the University of Michigan (UM), according to the 2024 annual report from the International Center, Chinese students also represent the largest international group, totaling 4,046 individuals.
Prior to publication, the Michigan Advance reached out in person to MSU’s Office for International Students and Scholars seeking comment. However, the OISS responded that, due to the lack of clear information about the federal government’s decisions, they are not in a position to provide any comments.
MSU spokesperson, Amber McCann, in an emailed statement to the Advance, stated that MSU is “closely monitoring recent federal policy changes” and analyzing the consequences that could affect international students in order to “provide guidance and support”.
“International education and exchange are fundamental to Michigan State University’s identity as a leading public global research university.  We will continue to advocate for policies that enable us to welcome international students and scholars from around the world and promote global engagement,” McCann concluded.
Neither the University of Michigan nor the U of M International Center responded to requests for comment.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Following a protest in response to a string of violence and deaths at state prisons and amid continuing talks about potential prison construction, South Dakota officials say they’ve busted a ring of drug smuggling in prison facilities and imposed a non-contact visit policy.
No drug charges have been filed, according to a Thursday news release from the state Department of Corrections, which said an investigation is ongoing involving its Inspector General’s Office, the state Division of Criminal Investigation and the U.S. postmaster general.
“If the results of the investigation warrant prosecution, criminal charges will be sought,” the news release said. “We will continue to counter every attempt to introduce dangerous contraband into our facilities.”
10 injured in prison violence days after protests over security and inmate treatment

The news release said three methods of drug delivery into prisons were identified and stopped:

Through the use of counterfeit packages imitating well-known manufacturers with drugs sent in through the packages.
Through false use of the privileged mail system, such as counterfeit legal mail.
And through the actions of visitors, including family members and friends, bringing drugs into the prison during visitation.

The press release went on to say that three inmate deaths — one in February and two this month — were linked to drug overdoses on the penitentiary campus in Sioux Falls.
The Department of Corrections has also imposed non-contact visits for family and friends of inmates “in certain facilities,” the press release said. It also said “non-contact visits may be expanded to other prison facilities” and “additional policy changes are also under review.”
“We wanted to ensure that the public is aware of the work that has been done in these cases. We are taking action to keep staff and inmates safe,” said a quote in the news release from Secretary of Corrections Kellie Wasko.
The drug investigation is occurring against the backdrop of activism against prison conditions and inmate treatment, including a protest Friday by about 50 people. Meanwhile, the state’s Project Prison Reset task force is considering plans to construct new prison facilities. The group’s next meeting is Tuesday in Pierre.

,DC,2025-05-29 19:56:12+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Appeals court restores Trump tariffs for now, after trade court blocks most",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/appeals-court-restores-trump-tariffs-now-after-trade-court-blocks-most,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s global tariffs can remain in place while the courts examine whether the sweeping import taxes that have roiled worldwide trade reach beyond his presidential authority.The U.S. Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit delivered the order swiftly Thursday, handing Trump a win after a lower trade court blocked nearly all of the president’s unprecedented emergency tariffs that affect U.S. trade with nearly every other nation.The administration had immediately appealed the ruling and threatened to take the case to the Supreme Court as early as Friday if a stay was not granted.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt slammed the earlier decision Thursday, saying the three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Trade “brazenly abused their judicial power.”“Our trade agenda is moving forward, and we’ve already heard from countries around the world today who will continue to negotiate in good faith with the United States so we can cut good trade deals on behalf of the American people, and we fully expect to win this case in court,” Leavitt said at the daily press briefing.Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney took to social media Thursday to say that his country “welcomes” the U.S. trade court’s decision.“It confirmed what we’ve always held: that the American tariffs against Canadian goods are unlawful and unjustified,” Carney wrote on X.Most tariffs blockedThe U.S. Court of International Trade had sided Wednesday with several businesses and a dozen states that sued the administration for using emergency powers to trigger the steep import taxes — the first time a U.S. president had ever done so.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic attorneys general, that brought the suit.The trade court’s ruling did not apply to tariffs Trump imposed under other statutes, including national security-related duties on foreign automobiles, as well as steel and aluminum. Some of the steel tariffs, imposed during Trump’s first term, were left in place under former President Joe Biden.Tariffs are taxes paid to the U.S. government by American companies and purchasers who want to bring imported products into the country.Tariffs began earlier this yearTrump began issuing emergency tariffs in February and March on products from Canada, Mexico and China, declaring national emergencies with respect to fentanyl smuggling from all three nations.The president escalated his trade policy on April 2, which he dubbed “liberation day,” when he announced tariffs on nearly every other nation after declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. Trump slapped some of the highest levies on countries that export more products to the U.S. than they buy in American goods.The announcement sent world markets plummeting and small businesses panicking, and ignited a trade war with China, peaking at a 145% tariff on Chinese goods.Trump paused his worldwide “reciprocal” tariffs until July 9, imposing a universal 10% import tax on every country while he said his administration negotiates new trade agreements — usually a lengthy, meticulous process.Trump lowered import taxes on Chinese goods to an effective baseline of 30% in mid-May to allow for three months of negotiations, according to the administration.Judges’ conclusionsThe trade court judges found that trade deficits — meaning we buy more from a country than they buy from us — do not constitute an emergency under the law and do not give the president unfettered power to impose unlimited tariffs.“Because of the Constitution’s express allocation of the tariff power to Congress, we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,” according to the court’s 61-page opinion.In its appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Trump administration argued IEEPA “clearly authorizes” the president to impose the tariffs.“Absent at least interim relief from this Court, the United States plans to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court tomorrow to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,” the administration wrote.Separately, Judge Rudolph Contreras for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., delivered a similar, but narrow, ruling Thursday for two businesses that sued the Trump administration. Contreras wrote in a 33-page opinion that the businesses faced “significant and unrecoverable"" financial losses as a result of the import taxes.",,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

(Photo courtesy of Alaska Airlines)Alaska Airlines has stopped rolling out the red carpet for the opening of Alaska’s salmon season.
The airline has paused a 15-year-old program that celebrates the Copper River salmon run, one of Alaska’s earliest commercial salmon fisheries, the company confirmed by email.
For more than a decade, Alaska Airlines observed the unofficial opening of Alaska’s salmon season by flying a king salmon from Cordova to Seattle, where it was presented to chefs in a red carpet photo opportunity known as the First Fish event.
Last year, the company switched things up with an event in Boston, instead of Seattle. This year, the company didn’t publicly mark the start of the salmon season.
“I wouldn’t describe it as an end — more of a pause. We’ve had a lot of exciting developments at Alaska Air Cargo, including the addition of new widebody cargo operations alongside our regular domestic and in-state service. Given the increased activity, we made the decision to pause this year’s First Fish event,” said Tim Thompson, Alaska Airlines’ public affairs manager, by email.
Thompson said the company is still committed to flying out Alaska’s seafood.
“Since last Friday, we’ve already transported over 150,000 pounds of Copper River salmon out of Cordova,” he said by email.
The decision to pause the “First Fish” event comes amid an uncertain time for Alaska’s commercial king salmon fishery.
While the state is forecasting better returns for pink, sockeye, coho and chum salmon, king salmon — formally called Chinook salmon — aren’t faring as well.
Last year, Alaska fishermen harvested 244,000 Chinook, according to figures from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This year’s harvest is expected to be only 144,000 fish, and the state has significantly restricted commercial fishing for Chinook and other species of salmon, to allow for more fish to return.
This month, a conservation group filed a lawsuit as part of a campaign to urge the federal government to list Gulf of Alaska king salmon as threatened or endangered. The same group has successfully convinced many restaurants in Seattle — Alaska Airlines’ home city — to remove king salmon from their menus.
The Alaska seafood industry has been struggling to weather economic and environmental forces over the last several years, including low prices, high operating costs and a shrunken global market share, prompting a state legislative task force and some new actions to provide aid to the industry.
Christa Hoover is the director of the Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association, which promotes the region’s fish on behalf of its fishermen.
She said that regardless of the reason for Alaska Airlines’ decision, the First Fish program will be missed as long as it’s gone.
“It was a great, fun event for us to be part of, and we look forward to it every year,” she said. “It built this really great excitement. And it wasn’t solely focused on Copper River salmon. It was timed with ours because traditionally, we start the season off, but it was just really fun. You could feel the energy of it, and then you watch that energy kind of reverberate across the country. And it was just a really fun way to start the season, and we miss it terribly.”

Tribal representatives who have pursued tuition waivers for years feel they’ve been shuffled around unduly. “It’s kind of like we’re getting pushed in circles.” 
The post As Native tuition program gains traction, tribal advocates criticize University of Wyoming’s delays appeared first on WyoFile .","The University of Wyoming is a land grant university, meaning revenue from lands the federal government gave to Wyoming helped generate the school’s endowment. The United States seized vast swaths of those lands from tribes — sometimes for little or no money — and gifted them to the new state to benefit public education. UW still receives the funds generated from leasing those lands. 
That is one reason Wyoming’s Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone tribes say the university should help defray college costs for tribal students, including with tuition waivers. 
Advocates have been pushing the effort for years. Now, UW is advancing a framework to give financial help to members of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes who graduate from Wyoming high schools. 
Rather than a tuition waiver — which aims to alleviate tuition costs for Indigenous students — the UW plan would set up what’s called a commitment structure, university representatives told the Legislature’s Select Committee on Tribal Relations last week.  
The commitment structure would be a four-year renewable scholarship that would equal tuition and mandatory fees until a first bachelor’s degree is earned, UW Vice President for Budget and Finance Alex Kean said. 
“You would have to be an enrolled member of the Northern Arapaho or Eastern Shoshone tribe, graduate from a Wyoming high school, complete [a federal aid application] on an annual basis, and in order to maintain that moving forward, be enrolled as a full time student or complete a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester,” Kean told lawmakers.

The university’s board of trustees has considered a draft plan and asked for amendments, Kean said. “But conceptually, I think there was an indication that we’re working towards something that is achievable.” 
However, tribal members had a different take. Tribal advocates feel the university has been punting the issue by asking them repeatedly for new data, Eastern Shoshone Education Director Harmony Spoonhunter said.
“It’s kind of like we’re getting pushed in circles,” Spoonhunter said. “I started in 2011 and we’ve been working on this for a really long time.”
In the meantime, she said, she’s watched states like Colorado and Montana enact native tuition waivers. “And so I would like to see that here.”
Taking the lead
UW President Ed Seidel in September 2024 pledged to spearhead an effort to define what Native student tuition waivers could look like for the school’s undergraduates. 
He made the commitment after a “circular” conversation between UW trustees and state lawmakers about which entity is responsible for initiating such a plan. Education leaders and lawmakers have batted the concept around for years.
Advocates say a waiver would lower barriers and encourage more Native American students to enroll in higher education, where their participation and graduation rates lag. Others say universities that have benefited financially from ancestral tribal lands, like UW, have ethical obligations to the state’s Native American residents.
Alyson White Eagle, a research assistant, student in the UW College of Law and Northern Arapaho tribal member, zeroed in on Native tuition waivers for a research project she presented to the legislative committee a year ago. 

Retention rates for American Indian and Alaska Native students lag behind the average at the University of Wyoming. (Graphic prepared by the University of Wyoming for the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Committee on Tribal Relations.)
White Eagle pointed to the acquisition of lands. “UW has made a return on revenue generated from the sale of these lands from the Morrill Act at a rate of 321 times,” she said. “Despite this considerable revenue generation, UW’s Native student population, native faculty [and] staff population is pretty low.”
Less than 1% of the UW student body reports being Native American or Alaskan Native, compared to 4% of the state population holding tribal affiliations, according to her report. Retention and graduation rates among Indigenous students also lag behind the general student population.
The University of Wyoming currently offers aid to Indigenous students through roughly 17 different endowed funds, UW Foundation President and CEO John Stark told the committee last week. 
But this new commitment structure concept would be specifically focused on giving Native students a leg up. 
Headway 
The proposal would be funded by a new endowment structure, Kean said. The UW board of trustees has asked to review a complete endowment agreement “so that they know what it is exactly that they’re approving.”
Once that is in place, he continued, “then we would begin the discussion of how to fund this.” The estimate is that $6 million would be needed to fund current enrollment levels, he said. 
The proposal is subject to final approval by the board. “But I think we’re making some headway,” Stark said.

Tribal representatives, however, told the committee that it’s already taken too long. UW continues to ask for data in a way that’s delaying the issue, Eastern Shoshone Business Council Chairman Wayland Large said. UW representatives also suggested that Spoonhunter start her own endowment, Northern Arapaho Business Council Chairman Keenan Groesbeck said, which was disrespectful.
“So all in all, the good old boy club at UW needs to deal with us, they need to give us the time to hear us out on these matters,” Groesbeck said. “And we’re here. We’re not going nowhere.”

According to state unemployment records, Bryce Murphy, 33, of Dubuque County was working for the Naughton Insurance Agency in 2020 when the company discovered that three of Murphy’s payroll checks had been altered to increase their value.
The company also discovered that a letter and pay stub Murphy provided to a credit union as evidence of his employment had been altered. Murphy was fired in November 2020 and an administrative law judge later determined his actions amounted to theft and forgery.
Three years later, in 2023, Murphy was criminally charged with identity theft, fraudulent practices in the first degree, forgery and two counts of insurance fraud.
The charges were tied to allegations that Murphy had amended his Farmer’s Insurance homeowner’s policy in 2019 to include two Rolex watches. A few months later, he reported to police his watches were stolen from a Minneapolis hotel room while he attended a Minnesota Vikings football game. He then filed an insurance claim for the reported theft, and Farmer’s Insurance paid out $9,998 on the claim.
Three years later, while working for American Family Insurance, Murphy obtained an insurance policy from his employer for the same type of Rolex watches he had reported stolen in 2019.










I was so focused on making other people proud of me that I lost sight of my integrity and honesty.


– Bryce Murphy of Dubuque County


In September 2022, Murphy reported the two watches were stolen under similar circumstances as the 2019 incident: He alleged the watches disappeared from his luggage in a Minneapolis hotel as he attended another Vikings football game. He filed an insurance claim with American Family, which triggered an investigation that concluded the watches in question, assuming they were actually stolen, were most likely fake Rolexes.
Murphy later pleaded guilty to a charge of fraudulent practices and one count of insurance fraud, which resulted in 10-year and five-year prison sentences to run concurrently.
“I was so focused on making other people proud of me that I lost sight of my integrity and honesty,” Murphy informed the court prior to his sentencing.
Insurance Division acts, perjury charges filed 
In October 2024, the Iowa Insurance Division charged Murphy with four counts of regulatory violations. The charges were tied to the altered paychecks and letter from 2020, as well as newer claims related to allegedly fraudulent insurance claims and a failure to report his 2023 criminal prosecution.
At a hearing on the division’s charges, Murphy testified he did, as originally claimed, have four Rolex watches that were stolen. He allegedly admitted the watches were fake Rolexes, but said he felt justified in insuring them for the value he personally assigned to them.
The administrative law judge who presided over the hearing recently concluded that while he was “skeptical” Murphy had four watches stolen under such similar circumstances, the division had not proven the police reports and insurance claims were false.
Still, the judge noted, there was evidence Murphy overvalued the watches and falsified records, justifying the revocation of his license, which had already lapsed, and the imposition of a $3,000 civil penalty. Murphy has also been ordered to pay $3,460 for the division’s prosecution of the case.
Murphy continues to face legal problems stemming from his 2023 arrest. Immediately after his sentencing in the criminal case, prosecutors reported finding inconsistencies in the financial affidavits Murphy had submitted to the court and informed the court Murphy was guilty of “additional fraudulent activity” that was criminal in nature.
Since then, Murphy has been charged with three felony counts of perjury and entered a plea of not guilty. The case is still pending.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/insurance-policy-form-getty-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

The now two-member commission met for less than 3 minutes. Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, the commission chair, said the search warrant came based on “a joint federal-state investigation into alleged criminal conduct.”
“These alleged offenses relate to his fitness and ability to continue to serve in his present position,” Bailey said. “An immediate suspension is necessary pending receipt of further information.”
Bailey and Commissioner Kim Lowe of Kearney both voted to suspend Rupe. No other details were shared.
The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office declined to comment Thursday. The Omaha FBI office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A call to Rupe went to voicemail.
The Governor’s Office declined to comment on a legal issue for a state agency not directly under Gov. Jim Pillen’s control. 
Rupe began serving as the Liquor Control Commission’s executive director Jan. 15, 2004. He previously served almost 10 years as an assistant attorney general. Rupe is admitted to practice before the Nebraska Supreme Court, the local U.S. District Court, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo courtesy The Bitcoin Conference)Cryptocurrency firms and investors can count on the Trump administration to do everything in its power to protect them and promote their interests and agenda, Vice President JD Vance assured attendees at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas this week.
In return, the crypto community must continue a level of political activism that stepped up substantially in the 2024 campaign cycle, Vance said.
The most tangible form of that activism was a campaign war chest of nearly a quarter billion dollars in the 2024 campaign cycle, easily more than than any other industry in the country.
Republican election victories last year were in part “because you guys got organized and got involved in American politics,” Vance told the conference crowd. 
Vance told the commodity’s advocates they will need to “take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024, and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond,” Vance said Wednesday. 
During a half-hour speech, Vance detailed steps the Trump administration is taking to bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream U.S. economy.
“We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay,” Vance said.
Vance pointed to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, a bill that would regulate “stablecoins”— a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the dollar and backed by traditional assets, predominantly U.S. Treasury bonds. 
“Once the GENIUS Act is enacted, it’s poised to vastly expand the use of stablecoins as a digital payment system for millions of our fellow Americans,” Vance said.
The Senate voted 66-22 last week to advance the GENIUS Act, with support from 16 Democrats, including Nevada’s Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen. If passed, the bill would be the first piece of cryptocurrency legislation.
Speaking at the Bitcoin conference earlier in the week, Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, one of the Senate’s staunchest crypto advocates, described the GENIUS Act as the easiest pro-crypto legislation to start with. Unlike other digital currency products, stablecoin is “100 percent backed by fiat currency,” which reassures the public and its elected representatives, Lummis said. 
After the GENIUS Act, Vance said the Trump administration will turn to legislation establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency that “fully incorporates crypto assets into the mainstream economy.” 
“If we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a clear jurisdiction,” Vance said. 
Touting the Trump administration’s friendlier approach to digital currency than that of the Biden administration, Vance repeatedly highlighted the ousting of federal financial regulator Gary Gensler, eliciting rancorous applause from attendees in the packed conference hall. 
Gensler, who served as the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair under the Biden administration, stepped down from his post after Trump vowed to fire him on day one. Gensler was a harsh critic of what he characterized as crypto’s “unwillingness to comply with applicable laws and regulations” and “widespread noncompliance has resulted in widespread fraud, bankruptcies, failures, and misconduct.”
“We reject regulators,” Vance told the Bitcoin conference. “Maybe the most important thing that we did for this community. We rejected regulators and we fired Gary Gensler,” Vance said. 
Trump’s own ventures into cryptocurrency have have been labeled by critics as a corrupt means by which special interests in the U.S. and abroad can inappropriately influence U.S. policy, and Democrats have cited Trump’s activities as warranting more, not less, regulation of digital currency.
Vance stressed that regulations pushed by the Trump administration are designed to boost cryptocurrency rather than restrain it.
“The best way to ensure that crypto is part of the mainstream economy is through a market structure bill that champions and doesn’t restrict the extraordinary value that Bitcoin and other digital assets represent,” Vance said. 
Crypto and the right
Hundreds of attendees were locked out of the vice president’s speech after doors to the conference hall closed shortly after 9 a.m., with the last few attendees who made it in pumping their fists in the air. Attendees who could not find seats crowded the back of the dark conference hall.
Conference organizers estimated about 35,000 people would attend the conference.
Vance was selected as the keynote speaker due to his long support for cryptocurrency, attracting something of a warm following among his fellow crypto holders. 
Vance acknowledged cryptocurrency’s popularity with right-wing voters, saying “what I’ve noticed is that very smart right wing people in tech tend to be attracted to Bitcoin and crypto” while smart left-wing people tend to be attracted to artificial intelligence.
Cryptocurrency has seemingly been adopted along an ideological divide, a trend that has driven Trump to prioritize the digital asset. Trump launched his own cryptocurrency token days before his inauguration, which currently sits at $12.66.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s embrace of right-wing politics was preceded by his enthusiasm for cryptocurrency — “DOGE” was named after a meme coin. 
Vance urged cryptocurrency advocates not to “ignore politics” and vote for politicians who support the digital asset.
Vance said there is “an incredibly valued conservative element to crypto technology,” describing it as a tool against government and private sector overreach.
“Crypto is a hedge against bad policy making from Washington,” Vance said.  “It’s a hedge against the private sector that’s increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC05611-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

“Right now, the nation needs strong conservative leadership, somebody that’s going to be able to advance President Trump’s agenda,” Marshall said in an interview with Washington Examiner Thursday. “And the work that I’ve done as attorney general, I think, makes it abundantly clear that I’m willing to fight the right battles and to be effective in doing it, and look forward to being able to take that to the Senate.”

As the attorney general, Marshall has embraced conservative causes and beliefs including joining a lawsuit filed last year seeking to prevent New York from withdrawing religious exemptions for the measles vaccine, briefs that support efforts to restrict gender affirming care for transgender people and efforts to overturn gun restrictions in other states.
When it comes to state issues, Marshall’s office prevailed in a lawsuit challenging Alabama’s transgender care ban earlier this year. But it lost a high-profile battle over congressional districting that led a federal court to order the redrawing of two districts where Black voters would have an opportunity to select their preferred representatives.
Marshall was appointed Alabama attorney general by former Gov. Robert Bentley in 2017, after former Attorney General Luther Strange was appointed to the U.S. Senate. He won re-election in 2018 and 2022 and is not eligible for re-election again.
Tuberville on Tuesday announced that he would run for governor of Alabama next year.

Patrick Morrisey ceremoniously signed three bills during an event at a Beckley, W.Va.,church Thursday, May 29, 2025. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Thursday celebrated the passage of three bills he said protect and defend life “at all stages.” Morrisey held the ceremonial bill signing for Senate Bill 537, House Bill 2123 and House Bill 2871 at CrossPoint Church in Beckley, West Virginia.
“West Virginia has a proud history defending the sanctity of life for a long, long time, and I’ve been very humbled to be an important part of that, serving as the first pro-life attorney general in state history,” Morrisey said. “And before I left, we were still busy defending the state’s pro-life law in the Fourth Circuit. That’s still pending, and we’ve been working constantly to try to keep expanding the provisions to protect innocent life.”

Senate Bill 537 expands the state’s Mothers and Babies Pregnancy Support Program. The legislation allows the program to use state funds to cover new expenditures including new land and buildings, additional services for mothers, and staff training, Morrisey said. The Legislature also allocated $3 million for the program. 

“The goal behind that money and this bill is to give organizations that help pregnant women greater flexibility in using their funds,” Morrisey said. “What a good, noble cause.”
The West Virginia Mothers and Babies Pregnancy Support Program was established by House Bill 2002, signed by former Gov. Jim Justice during the 2023 legislative session. 
State lawmakers passed a law making abortion illegal with narrow exceptions in September 2022 in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down Roe V. Wade. The program provides funding for “pregnancy support organizations” except those “that performs, prescribes, refers for, encourages or promotes abortion as an option for a pregnant woman.”

House Bill 2123 increases the penalties for a parents or guardians convicted of child abuse resulting in injury or neglect causing the risk of injury from one to five years in prison to two to 10 years in prison. The bill had unanimous support in both the West Virginia House of Delegates and in the Senate.

“Once again, we have to protect our most precious among us, and if you harm a child as a parent or guardian, you’re going to pay a heavy price,” Morrisey said. 

House Bill 2871 expands the vehicular homicide offense to include aggravated vehicular homicide and clarifies that victims can include embryos and fetuses. The bill was also passed unanimously by both chambers of the Legislature. 

“Now, the loss of a child in a womb, that can be considered a death for purposes of prosecution,” Morrisey said. “That’s good, and that’s just common sense. A life in the womb is still a life. Our laws have to reflect that fact, and they are.”

Henry McMaster praised a new law criminalizing the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, also known as “revenge porn,” which lawmakers said Thursday was long overdue.
Since last June, when a law in Massachusetts took effect, South Carolina had been the only state in the nation that didn’t ban the distribution of nude photos of someone without permission. The Palmetto State ban applies to photos and videos. Those include fake images made through artificial intelligence or any other technology that are “indistinguishable from an authentic visual depiction of the individual.”
Thursday’s celebratory signing at the Statehouse comes 10 days after President Donald Trump signed a similar bill into law.
“We’ve seen tragedies occur. We’ve seen these crimes occur. But this particular one in South Carolina was not a crime at the time, but it is now,” said McMaster, who actually signed the bill into law on May 12. It took effect immediately.
Differences between the new state and federal laws include the punishment.
Here’s how you can use the Take It Down Act

Under the federal “Take It Down Act,” the maximum penalty is a $5,000 fine and two years in prison — three years if the victim is a minor.
In South Carolina, the same crime is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. For any additional conviction, the violator faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The exception would be someone who can prove there was no intent to damage the victim’s reputation or cause harm. That would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail on first offense only.
A provision in the federal law additionally gives victims a way to get a photo or video removed from social media. But that part, which requires online platforms to create a request-and-removal process, doesn’t take effect until next year.
Rep. Brandon Guffey said the state law’s passage signifies an age shift in the Legislature.
“It shows that there is a new generation within the Statehouse that understands cybercrimes,” said the Rock Hill Republican.
Rep. Chris Wooten, the lead sponsor for several years, has said previous efforts died not because of opposition, but rather a lack of understanding of the problem — or that it existed.
The Lexington Republican started pushing for the legislation after his work on an oversight committee made him realize law enforcement had no way of prosecuting people who spread images without consent — but weren’t doing it for profit. He pre-filed his first bill in December 2022. At the time, South Carolina was among three states that didn’t criminalize it. That bill died last year without ever getting a hearing.
Wooten pre-filed another bill ahead of this year’s session. This time, it passed both chambers unanimously before getting the governor’s signature.
“I want to continue to protect not only our daughters, wives and significant others, but our sons too,” Wooten said in McMaster’s office, signaling to Guffey.
In 2023, the Legislature passed a law banning sexual extortion, often called “sextortion,” when someone uses sexual photos or videos to blackmail people. That law is named Gavin’s Law after Guffey’s 17-year-old son, who died by suicide three years ago after a scammer posing as a college girl on Instagram threatened to release explicit photos unless he kept sending them money.

A Nigerian man was extradited earlier this year to the U.S. to face federal charges for the scam.
But Gavin’s Law applies only if money is involved, not if someone is using it embarrass, humiliate or harm someone’s reputation.
Beyond leading for the more protections in South Carolina law, Guffey traveled to Washington, D.C., in February to call on Congress to pass the federal version of what’s commonly called “revenge porn.” He was recognized during the ceremony at the White House on May 19, when Trump signed it into law.
Attorney General Alan Wilson, who also attended the White House ceremony, said he prefers the South Carolina version because of the tougher penalties.
“Thank you for what you did,” Wilson said of the law’s passage. “Now we can get to work.”
Other laws passed this year will also help his office protect children, he said.

Those include two bills criminalizing the use of AI — or any other technology — to create or morph images and videos of children into inappropriate content.
Another new law, one that Wilson lauded as a “game changer”, granted his office power to subpoena websites and internet providers to locate people suspected of accessing child pornography, speeding up these investigations.
These new laws will “make it better for us to be able to go after people who exploit those using the internet,” Wilson said.
All of those laws passed in the final days of this year’s legislative session, which officially ended May 8.
Better late than never, McMaster said.
“Some folks say in politics, ‘nothing gets done without a deadline,'” he said in his office, before sitting down for the public signing. “It takes legislation a long time to pass. Sometimes, it takes way too long.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5074-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

Greg Gianforte.
Most seat belt laws are left to states, and Montana passed its first legislation on the topic in 1987. Laws regarding child passenger protection have only been updated three times in the past 25 years.
Rep. Marc Lee, a Butte Democrat, brought the bill, which sought to tighten standards to increase safety for small children riding in cars. It had significant bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.
Lee has been a Butte firefighter for three decades, is a certified instructor on car safety for kids and teaches first responders and nurses proper child vehicle restraint practices.
“While teaching these classes to the groups I mentioned, we as instructors, used to half-heartedly joke about how weak Montana’s laws are when it comes to child passenger safety,” Lee said during a House Transportation Hearing on the bill. He said the realization spurred him to sponsor the bill. The legislation adds definitions for “booster seats,” “child safety restraint system” and “properly restrained.”
Prior to the change, the law’s only guidance was that children under age 6 and 60 pounds “must be transported and properly restrained in a child safety restraint.”
The new law axes that requirement and replaces it with standards for different ages.
Lee said the old law lacked “detail” and that it did not put children in the “safest possible position” for travel. It also requires car seats to meet federal motor vehicle safety standards.
Passengers under 2 years of age must be in a rear-facing seat and properly restrained. Children aged from 2 to 4 must be in a rear-facing seat, or a forward-facing seat with an internal harness.
Kids aged 4 to 8 must be properly restrained in a forward-facing car seat with an internal harness or utilize a booster seat to safely use the car’s shoulder seat belt.
Lastly, there’s guidance for children aging out of booster seats:

“A motor vehicle passenger who is at least 9 years of age or has outgrown the height or weight limits of a child booster seat as set by the manufacturer, whichever comes first, must be secured with a motor vehicle adult safety belt.” 
Wendy Olson Hansen, who has been a certified child passenger safety technician for 25 years, said during the hearing that about 71% of the checks they have show proper usage of car seats. 
In the past, she said, there was a time when about 90% of people were incorrectly using car seats.
“We’ve made improvement,” Hansen said. “We’d like to continue to see more improvement.”
In 2022, the United States averaged about three child deaths caused by car crashes per day. That year, there were more than 42,000 vehicle crash deaths — almost 1,200 of those were kids. Montana’s fatality rate for car crashes is also often above the national average.
The law did not change any penalties.
“This wasn’t designed to be a law enforcement bill whatsoever,” Lee said during the House hearing. “We did not change any of the fines. We did not make it a graduated fine schedule or anything along those lines. We truly just want to make this a child protection bill.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GettyImages-958271472-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

Officials remain committed to sharing police services between the towns, but hurdles remain to merging the two departments.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThree months after the disruptive police chief controversy in Hinesburg and Richmond, officials in the two Chittenden County towns are renewing efforts to share police services. The two towns in April renewed a contract to share a police chief through March 2026, ensuring a continued cooperation that began between the two departments in 2023.Now, a police committee formed in April, made up of officials from Hinesburg and Richmond, is aiming to hire a new interim police chief to replace Anthony Cambridge, who departed Hinesburg under scrutiny and was later sacked as Richmond’s police chief hours before his start date.Hinesburg police officer Frank Bryan has been serving as the interim chief since Cambridge’s departure, overseeing both the Hinesburg and Richmond departments.It may not be easy to find a candidate willing to take on the job. But town officials hope to find a candidate who could help fulfill a long-held objective to fully merge the two departments and pool resources amid a slim labor market for police officers.READ MORE
“It just doesn’t make sense to me anymore to have a single department town by town,” Hinesburg Selectboard member Mike Loner said at a recent police committee meeting. “I’m really hoping we can find somebody who has a lot of experience in an organizational background to help us figure out what are the hurdles to a merger and how we’re going to get around those.”Both police departments were facing staff shortages when they signed an inter-municipal contract in 2023. Under that agreement, Richmond paid Hinesburg an annual fee for contracted patrol and general services.The agreement later evolved to include the sharing of police chief services, with Cambridge acting as the de facto chief of both departments. In January, Cambridge announced he was leaving Hinesburg’s department for Richmond but would remain the chief of both departments.But those cooperative efforts hit a snag earlier this year when Richmond backed out of a plan to hire Cambridge as its police chief.In the weeks leading up to his departure from Hinesburg, Cambridge came under scrutiny by town and police officials there for allegedly deleting police security footage and shredding documents. He left Hinesburg weeks before his scheduled end date.Richmond then withdrew Cambridge’s job offer after twice delaying his start date.Both towns have been mum on the issue, while Cambridge has maintained the allegations were part of a smear campaign.He later said in a social media post that his relationship with Hinesburg Town Manager Todd Odit broke down and there were persistent efforts to undermine his “ability to effectively act as chief.”Since then, town officials in police committee meetings have plotted a renewed effort for cooperation with Richmond. To help guide the hiring process for an interim chief, the committee heard from Jim Baker, a police consultant in Vermont and former head of the Vermont State Police with decades of experience in policing.Baker cautioned the committee that “going out for a police search right now … is going to be very, very difficult” but noted it would be “a fool’s errand” to try and find a police chief for each department.He told the committee it should focus on bringing in an administrator to help finalize an arrangement to merge the departments.Baker, who lives in Arlington near the New York border, pointed to the merged police department shared between Cambridge and Greenwich, New York, as an example of a success.“I think you have an opportunity to recreate what safety will look like between those two communities,” he said. “What I’m really proposing here really hasn’t been done in Vermont.”Town officials are optimistic that Hinesburg and Richmond could take the first step toward regionalizing police services. Bard Hill, a Richmond Selectboard member, said in an interview their efforts represent “the point of the spear on how we can share services across towns in Chittenden County.”“How many different police departments do you need for towns of 4,000 or 5,000 people?” Hill said. “There’s an economy of scale and efficiency, especially for towns that can work together effectively and have some similarities.”But merging departments “has some subtleties and complexities” that will make it complicated, Hill said.“It’s a somewhat awkward developmental stage, because you still are operating as two separate departments with separate policies and separate data sets,” he said.Officials were faced with a wrinkle at the most recent committee meeting Tuesday. While the towns’ police chief contract has been renewed, their contract for patrol services ends June 30, and Odit said during Tuesday’s meeting that Hinesburg officers are hesitant to proceed with a contract that isn’t reciprocal.Hinesburg currently has three officers, including Bryan, the interim chief, while Richmond has just one. It’s an unequal relationship, with Hinesburg officers covering both towns while getting little in return.“I’m just going to be pretty blunt. I know from Hinesburg officers’ position, continuing with a contract that’s not reciprocal is not tenable to them,” Odit said Tuesday. “It may be that there’s a pause in that contract while we figure out what we do.”Richmond Town Manager Josh Arneson said the town has budgeted for four police officers and the town is actively trying to fill those positions.“But hiring police officers is very challenging,” he said. “There’s not a large pool.”Committee officials are mulling an offer from Baker to search for an interim chief for both departments, but it remains to be seen whether the towns will renew their patrol services.“If we don’t end up with a services contract, you know, are we going to find a chief that wants to manage two departments that aren’t working together?” Odit said in an interview. “It all feels up in the air now.”Still, officials feel that proceeding with some type of a merger remains a worthwhile pursuit.“Everybody seems to think it makes sense, it’s just who’s going to do it, and how are they going to do it?” Hill said in an interview. “You have to be clear about what you’re trying to achieve and persist in achieving it, and I’m crossing my fingers that we have that combination of factors between the two towns right now.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hinesburg, Richmond try to chart new course for shared police services after police chief controversy.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hinesburg-police-1-20250220-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

Some students were detained by immigration authorities as part of that effort.Focus on ChinaIn his Wednesday announcement, Rubio said the State Department would also “revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong.”More than 277,000 Chinese students studied in the United States during the 2023-24 academic year — making up nearly one-quarter of the more than 1,126,000 total international students in that school year, according to a report from the Institute of International Education and the State Department.However, the total number of students from China declined slightly from the 2022-23 school year, when that figure stood at more than 289,000.In the 2023-24 academic year, Chinese students made up one-quarter or more of the total international student population within California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington state and Wisconsin.New York University, Northeastern University in Massachusetts and Columbia University in New York hosted the highest number of international students during that academic year.Students from South Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Vietnam and Nigeria also comprised large groups of international students in the United States during the 2023-24 school year.  The announcement raises myriad logistical questions over how the United States would carry out the effort, as well as how officials would determine who has “connections to the Chinese Communist Party.”The State Department did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for more details on the announcement.Meanwhile, the State Department temporarily paused new student visa interviews earlier this week as the administration prepares to expand the screening of applicants’ activity on social media, according to multiple reports.",,,,2025-05-29 16:07:36.123393

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.

The visas of UW-Madison’s Chinese students, who make up about half of the school’s international student body, could be at risk after the administration of President Donald Trump said Wednesday night it plans to “aggressively” revoke Chinese student visas and pause the rescheduling of visa review appointments. 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that international students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in “critical fields” could have their visas revoked. Rubio didn’t define what those critical fields would be and also provided little detail when he said that the State Department would “enhance scrutiny” on new student visa applications.
The administration has also said it plans to increase the vetting of visa applicants’ social media accounts. The announcement that the administration would be revoking the visas of Chinese students came the same day the State Department announced it had paused scheduling appointments for visa applicants. 
UW-Madison had 3,414 international students from China this spring semester. In recent years, the university has worked to expand its international student body, aiming to increase the international population from 4% to 8% by 2028. The acceptance of international students helps the university increase revenue as state aid has remained flat and inflation has increased costs because international students pay an average of four times the amount of tuition as in-state students. 
The university said Thursday it is monitoring the situation. 
“We are deeply concerned about the impact of such a policy on our Chinese student community,” the university said. 
In a message to its international students, the university advised them to attend visa appointments that are already scheduled and inform university staff if an appointment is canceled. The message also told the students to schedule appointments as quickly as possible once the pause on scheduling is lifted and to enroll in classes for the fall. 
These moves are the latest in the Trump administration’s efforts to attack international student visas. Earlier this spring, the administration deleted visa records for some students over minor traffic infractions and encounters with law enforcement. That effort temporarily canceled the visas of more than two dozen students and alumni at UW schools across the state. 
The Trump administration rolled back that decision and reinstated the visas after a federal judge ruled in favor of a number of students who sued to stop the revocation.

Kevin Stitt let an altered set of rules take effect. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A controversial proposed rule from Oklahoma’s chief education official to require schools to collect immigration status of students will not take effect. 
Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt let the legislatively altered set of rules governing the State Department of Education take effect without his signature.
The measure, which passed the House and Senate with unanimous, bipartisan support, removed two of the most controversial rules: a requirement that public schools collect proof of U.S. citizenship during enrollment and that teachers pass the U.S. Naturalization Test to earn or renew their certifications. 
Stitt had said he would reject the proposed immigration rule. He previously said even though it was a political issue that people would “come after” him for, it was the “right thing to do” and kids shouldn’t be “put on a list.”
Lawmakers had argued the immigration rule didn’t have any statutory authority and was unenforceable. The administrative rules are proposed by state agencies based on current law. They are subject to review and approval by the Legislature and the governor. When approved and enacted, the rules carry the force of law. 
“I will never waver in my belief that Oklahoma taxpayers deserve the utmost transparency – especially if their hard-earned dollars are being used to fund illegal immigrant’s education,” said state Superintendent Ryan Walters in a statement Thursday.
He said Oklahomans should know who is in their schools.
“Conservatives have an obligation to uphold conservative principles, not just to win an election, but year round,” Walters said.

Colorado-based Big Blue Technologies says its ""all-electric"" smelter would be cleaner and use less energy than conventional methods.
The post Wyoming proposed as home to North America’s ‘largest’ magnesium smelter appeared first on WyoFile .","A Colorado-based company wants to expand a pilot magnesium smelter now operating near Cheyenne as part of an effort to decrease the nation’s reliance on imports of the critical mineral, which, among other things, is a key component for electric vehicle batteries.
Big Blue Technologies now produces about 100 to 200 pounds per week in Wyoming. It proposes to “scale up” the pilot plant to produce 100 tons of magnesium annually, making it the largest magnesium metal production facility in North America, according to the company.
The Wyoming Energy Authority has recommended the project for a $1.5 million matching grant from the state to help support it.
The industry typically uses a lot of energy — smelters require considerable heat and historically contribute to fossil fuel emissions — but the company touts an “all-electric” process that could be fed by lower-carbon forms of electrical power. The company says its “aluminothermic reduction” technology would reduce energy consumption in the smelting process by up to 75% compared to conventional methods.

“Today, all primary, pure magnesium is sourced abroad, an indication that existing production technology is inadequate and uncompetitive,” Big Blue Technologies CEO Aaron Palumbo said in a prepared statement last year.
According to a state summary of Big Blue Technologies’ project, “There are no domestic primary producers” of magnesium. “Over 90% of global supply is controlled by China and Russia. Despite an abundance of magnesium ore, including in Wyoming, and a 108% import tariff on Chinese metal, none of the existing commercial smelting technologies are economically viable in the U.S.”
Exactly how much electricity will be required to power the Wyoming facility, and where it would come from, is unclear. But the company claims it will create a “vertically integrated mining and smelting operation to bolster a clean and economic production infrastructure.”
Big Blue Technologies says it “will assess the viability of carbon capture and sequestration from pure [carbon dioxide] generated during calcination of Wyoming dolomite” in the process. Also, last year, the company announced it had “secured an exploratory lease on a dolomite deposit on private land in the state of Wyoming.” Dolomite, which contains magnesium and calcium carbonate, is integral to the company’s smelting process. 
In August, the company announced a $2 million project backed by the Department of Energy’s Vehicle Technology Office “for the purpose of demonstrating sustainable and cost-competitive manufacture of automotive parts.” 
The Wyoming Energy Authority recently recommended a $1.5 million matching grant to the company via the state’s Energy Matching Funds program.

She is part of a new coalition opposing cuts to Medicaid. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A group of South Dakota health care advocates launched a “Hands Off Medicaid” coalition Thursday, pleading with the state’s all-Republican congressional delegation to avoid proposed cuts.
Medicaid is a federal-state health care program for low-income people. A U.S. House-approved budget reconciliation bill would reduce the program by $625 billion over 10 years under an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office. 
Shelley Ten Napel, CEO of the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas, is a member of Hands Off Medicaid.
“The proposed cuts will be especially harmful to rural South Dakota,” Ten Napel said. “When coverage rates fall, rural health centers lose critical funding – putting access to primary care, maternal care, dental services and behavioral health at risk for everyone in those communities.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill last week. It’s now under consideration by the Senate.
“This bill is a strong conservative work product, and one that is long overdue,” Johnson said last week in a press release. “It delivers a historic spending reduction and roots out abuse of federal programs. These changes are a meaningful attempt to turn our fiscal house in the right direction.”
SD Rep. Johnson votes yes as U.S. House Republicans push through budget reconciliation bill

Hands Off Medicaid’s introductory press conference included Democrat Earl Pomeroy, who served as a U.S. representative for North Dakota from 1993 to 2011. He said millions of Americans could lose care.
“This bill represents a complete retreat from decades of bipartisan progress in expanding access to health care,” Pomeroy said. “It will drive up the number of uninsured South Dakotans and leave rural hospitals drowning in tens of millions of dollars in uncompensated care.”
That fear is shared by retired family physician Tom Dean. Born and raised near Wessington Springs, he retired after 43 years of practice and still lives in the small South Dakota town.
“I’m really frightened about the impact it will have on nursing homes,” Dean said. 
About 147,000 South Dakotans are enrolled in Medicaid. The advocates said 49% of seniors and people with disabilities receive nursing home and community-based care through Medicaid. They also say one out of four births in the state is covered by Medicaid.
“Medicaid is a major payer for prenatal, delivery and postpartum care,” Dean said. “And that’s a major concern, especially in rural areas, but across the country. This country has an alarmingly high maternal mortality rate.”
The U.S. maternal mortality rate in 2022 was 22.3 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund, compared to zero in Norway, 1.2 in Switzerland, 3.4 in Japan, 3.5 in Germany, and 8.4 in Canada.
Shannon Bacon is the director of external affairs at Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas. She said access to obstetric care is declining across the state because fewer facilities are offering those services, in part because it “typically is a money-loser for hospitals, and especially for small rural hospitals that are already financially stressed.”
“And if we lose Medicaid coverage, it will make that problem even worse,” Bacon said. “And as a result, it will have a direct impact on outcomes.”

The bill includes a policy change that would require Medicaid enrollees who are between the ages of 19 and 65 to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month.
The language has numerous exceptions, including for pregnant women, parents of dependent children, people who have complex medical conditions, tribal community members, those in the foster care system, people who were in foster care who are below the age of 26, and individuals released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others.
Meanwhile, South Dakota officials are considering imposing their own work requirements on adult Medicaid expansion enrollees who don’t qualify for a list of exceptions. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match.
The first of two public hearings on the state’s Medicaid expansion work requirements proposal is at 10:30 a.m. Friday at the state Department of Social Services in Pierre.

(Screenshot from livestream)The Arkansas State Board of Education voted unanimously Thursday to dissolve the Blytheville School Board and place the district under a Level 5-Intensive Support classification due to ongoing academic, financial and administrative issues. 
The board authorized Education Secretary Jacob Oliva to assume the board’s duties, appoint a superintendent and pursue the possibility of a transformation contract, a provision of the LEARNS Act that allows struggling public schools to partner with an open-enrollment public charter school or another state board-approved entity to create “a public school district transformation campus.”
Education secretary to recommend increased support for east Arkansas school district

Oliva notified the board on May 8 of his intent to recommend the state’s highest support classification. He initially alerted the board to his concerns with the Northeast Arkansas school district last July. 
Over the last year, the Arkansas Department of Education has provided on-site support to the district, ADE Deputy Commissioner Stacy Smith said at the state board’s special meeting in Blytheville Thursday. 
The district is one of the lowest-performing in the state, struggles with declining enrollment and has financial issues, Smith said. Fiscal year 2025 revenue is down by about 15%, and the district has spent $1.5 million that was not budgeted, she said. 
Teachers and administrators have been receptive to the state’s help, and Blytheville has “a bright future,” but more assistance is needed, Smith said.
“People are showing up, but this is a district that is in need of a lot of support to be able to get them out of the hole that they’re currently in,” she said.  
Oliva notified the Blytheville School District of his recommendation of a Level 5-Intensive Support classification and the state board’s special meeting via a letter dated May 14. An ongoing lack of a permanent superintendent, delayed staffing decisions and stalled hiring processes have led to “organizational instability, weakened strategic planning efforts, and impeded the district’s capacity to effectively support students and staff,” according to the letter. 
In addition to an “absence of coherent leadership,” the letter also cited “inconsistent governance structure” and “chronic student underachievement.”
The district appealed the recommendation in a May 21 letter, which prompted a hearing at Thursday’s special meeting. The letter, signed by Interim Superintendent Jennnifer Blankenship and board President Desmond Hammett, argued the district has “worked tirelessly” to implement the education department’s recommendations and “demonstrated both measurable academic progress and consistent good faith efforts to comply with all directives.”
Specific actions include hiring a school improvement consulting firm, increasing the number of fully licensed educators and assigning mentors to novice teachers, the district leaders wrote. The letter also rebuts “chronic student underachievement,” noting that one school improved from an “F” ranking to a “C” ranking in one academic year. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Additionally, the district’s letter takes issue with Oliva’s past characterization of it as a “failure factory,” which “undermines the morale of educators and students,” its authors said. 
“It is difficult to accept the designation of Level 5-Intensive Support while actively doing everything we were advised to do,” the letter states. “Rather than punitive reclassification, we respectfully submit that BSD’s path would be better supported by continued partnership, encouragement, and recognition of its progress.”
The letter’s authors said they also “strongly disagree” with Oliva’s comments about a lack of “coherent leadership” and “inconsistent governance.” 
Blytheville has had two full-time superintendents and three interim superintendents since 2018, Smith said at the state board’s May 8 meeting. Blankenship was appointed as the current interim superintendent on June 12, 2024. She also served in the interim role from July through December 2021. 
After the previous superintendent was officially terminated last August, the board reviewed candidates in late November and decided to keep Blankenship. A consulting firm hired in February presented two of 13 applicants in late April, but the board declined to interview them and reposted the position, Smith said.
According to the district’s letter, the board voted to delay interviews because it hadn’t received certain requested information.
“Unfortunately, the ADE observer left the meeting without seeking clarification, which may have inadvertently contributed to subsequent misunderstandings about governance stability,” the letter states. 
At Thursday’s meeting, Hammett said the board didn’t refuse to interview the two candidates, but instead extended the application deadline by two weeks to gather a larger pool of applicants.

Smith confirmed that Blytheville’s school board decided at its May 22 meeting to interview three applicants. One interview was scheduled for Thursday, and Smith said she “would be embarrassed” to interview a superintendent on the same day that the state board is considering whether to dissolve the school board. 
“While it may be embarrassing to some,” Hammett said, the board was committed to continuing its work. Blytheville has only been working with the state for a year, Hammett said, and he believes the district can continue to improve. 
The state board’s discussion of Blytheville’s circumstances at its May 8 meeting was “disappointing and discouraging,” but the school board “rose to the challenge,” he said. 
“We didn’t tuck our tails, we didn’t run away from the challenge,” he said. “We became more committed, more engaged to show that we’re not dysfunctional, that we’re willing to do the work.”  
Much of Thursday’s discussion centered on frustration with the board’s actions, or lack thereof. Oliva discussed “frustration of how much we have to babysit the people that are elected to govern the district.” 
Meanwhile, members of the public like Blytheville native Bradley Ballard requested the state board dissolve the school board “before more damage is done.”
“This [mess] is the result of a board that is too prideful to lead and too fractured to function,” Ballard said. “We cannot keep pointing fingers while our children fall through the cracks. Today you have the power to stop this. You can cut through the chaos and bring order, accountability and hope back to our schools.”
The state board granted his request and voted to dissolve Blytheville’s school board and give the district a Level 5-Intensive Support classification. Blytheville joins four other districts that already have the state’s highest support classification — Earle, Lee County, Helena-West Helena and Marvell-Elaine.

(Photo b y Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Despite the impassioned pleas of a handful of lawmakers, the Maine Legislature essentially killed a proposal to further explore extending passenger rail to Bangor. 
After multiple failed votes, the Senate decided Thursday to indefinitely postpone LD 487, which rail advocates rallied behind this session as a means to bring passenger trains beyond southern Maine. The House of Representatives rejected the proposal Tuesday with a 93-52 vote, but the upper chamber has been at an impasse since senators were divided over the measure.
“This has been indefinitely postponed for 20-plus years,” said Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot) on the Senate floor Thursday, referring to the years-long effort to expand passenger rail in the state. 
This bill sought to have the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority apply for federal funding to identify a potential passenger rail corridor from Portland through Auburn, Lewiston, Waterville, Bangor and ending in Orono. 
Among the members of the Legislature’s Transportation Committee, only one supported it with the other 12 in opposition.
During the House debate, Rep. Lydia Crafts (D-Newcastle), who co-chairs the Transportation Committee, admitted there is public interest in expanding mass transit in the state, but said LD 487 doesn’t align with the state’s rail plan. 
She argued it wouldn’t make financial sense for the state to invest in the line and eventually subsidize the cost of tickets because a propensity study indicated that the particular route would have low ridership. Rather, she said that study recommended the state invest in flexible, accessible bus service such as the two-year pilot project currently underway, which runs between Lewison and Portland. 
Sen. Brad Farrin (R-Somerset) made similar points on the Senate floor, saying that the state will continue to grow rail at a “reasonable and responsible” rate if it follows the plan it has in place. 
However, Rep. Tavis Hasenfus (D-Readfield), the bill’s sponsor, said the propensity study is a couple years old and doesn’t account for improvements that have since been made to those tracks, which could reduce costs for the state. He also said it didn’t account for all potential riders, only those who would have taken a car. 
But talking about what the state would have to spend is getting ahead of what LD 487 sought to do, Hasenfus argued. As he explained on the House floor, his proposal simply asked the Department of Transportation to apply for the federal funding to investigate whether a passenger rail line to northern Maine is feasible. 
The proposal specifically asks for the state to apply to the Federal Railroad Administration’s corridor identification and development program, which is part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Meeting the deadline for this application cycle is vital because the $1.2 trillion law isn’t guaranteed to be renewed, especially since President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office pausing the disbursement of funds under the law.
“The train is literally about to leave the station and if we don’t get on board now, we may never have the opportunity in the future,” Hasenfus said Tuesday. 
Cost shouldn’t be the barrier that some see it as, Baldacci said during Senate floor discussions earlier this week, because the state should have been making passenger rail investments gradually over time. He said the whole state deserves to be connected and has a right to transportation options that already exist in southern Maine. LD 487 doesn’t call for a significant financial investment by the state at this point, he said, it just asks lawmakers to utilize the options available to move the process forward. 
Rep. Karen Montell (D-Gardiner) spoke in support of the bill, arguing that increased train options could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and road maintenance costs. She said that passenger rail could help build a Maine that is more “future ready.”
Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) agreed, saying that central and northern Maine could use passenger rail infrastructure so people can have easier access to jobs and education. She said this is especially true for her community of Bangor, which can feel like “a bit of a vortex” and disconnected from the rest of the state. 
Hasenfus also cited a study the Rail Passengers Association published earlier this month that found extending the Amtrak Downeaster service to Bangor could generate more than $60 million in annual economic benefits for all 16 counties and draw more than 260,000 in the first year of service. 
Having ridden it multiple times himself, Sen. James Libby (R-Cumberland) called the Downeaster a “tremendous service.” Though he acknowledged it could ultimately cost money, he said he supported the measure as expanded rail service would be an asset for towns like Waterville, where he works as a professor at Thomas College.

Gov. Ron DeSantis stuck to his promise and on Thursday vetoed legislation that would have eliminated a bar against parents of adult children and the adult children of single parents suing hospitals and physicians for non-economic damages for the deaths of loved ones.
“Whether the physician was perfect or whether the physicians was not, if somebody doesn’t make it through that, you know, that is a tragedy in one form or another, and the loss for a family member, even in someone that’s an adult, an independent, at that point, is real. And I think everyone appreciates that,” the governor said during a news conference outside Lee Health in Fort Myers.
“I think the question, though, is what would this legislation do for costs of health care in Florida, access to care in Florida, and our ability to recruit and keep physicians,” DeSantis said.
Joining him were Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, Lee Health President Dr. Lawrence Antonucci, and a spate of others who supported the veto. Non-economic damages include pain-and-suffering. Plaintiffs can still recover economic damages, such as lost wages, medical bills, and funeral costs.
DeSantis said it was their collective opinion that “if this legislation would be enacted, it would lead to higher costs for Floridians, it would lead to less care for Floridians, and it would make it harder for us to keep, recruit, and maintain physicians in the state of Florida.”
While the veto drew support from a line of Tallahassee special-interest groups, it drew criticism from those who’ve been unable to fully win compensation for potential acts of medical malpractice.
The bill itself (HB 6017) passed overwhelmingly on bipartisans vote in the Republican-controlled Legislature — more than enough of a margin to sustain a veto override, which takes two-thirds majority, should it come to that.
DeSantis said the Legislature could win his support by including limits on non-economic damages in all medical malpractice lawsuits, plus caps on plaintiff attorney fees.
The Florida Senate previously voted by a razor thin, one-vote margin to reject limits on non-economic damages.

“I am aware that he’s probably spoken to the lobbyists, but I haven’t found a single family yet that he spoke to who this is actually affected. That really hurts, because those are the people that he should be speaking to,” Sabrina Davis told the Florida Phoenix.
Davis has dedicated considerable time and attention to trying to remove Florida’s non-economic damages ban after her father, Navy veteran Keith Davis, died from a blood clot after being admitted to a hospital for knee pain.
Davis successfully filed a complaint against the doctor with the Department of Health. The board found the doctor violated the standards of care and committed medical malpractice, hit him with a  $7,500 fine, and made him take a continuing education course on blood clots.
Even if he had not vetoed the legislation, Davis would not be able to recover non-economic damages because the law wouldn’t have applied retroactively. But she went to every legislative committee meeting, every local delegation meeting, and scheduled as many one-on-one meetings with legislators as she could since her dad died in 2020.
When asked why, Davis reflected: 
“Well, it gives me peace, because I know my dad took an oath to fight for our country’s freedom, no matter what it meant. And although he didn’t die on the battlefield, he did die by the very people that were supposed to protect him. 
“And so, when I think about it, I’m reminded that my freedom was taken away after my dad died, and there’s a small part of me that thinks, when this law ends, I can say that I helped and I contributed it to it ending. Then that freedom my dad fought for in the Navy would not be in vain, and that I, through him, or him through I, helped restore the freedom that he once fought for. “
The governor said earlier this month that he planned to veto the bill. So while Davis is upset, she isn’t surprised.
Or alone.
Bill sponsor Rep. Dana Trabulsy wrote the governor Wednesday asking him not to veto the legislation.
“This entire conversation ultimately comes down to one word: justice. When a loved one dies due to admitted malpractice, and the law says their life has no legal value because they were an adult with no dependents —that’s not just a legal loophole, that’s a moral failing.
“It’s shameful. It should break the heart of every Floridian, including yours. Florida remains the only state in the nation where some lives are legally worthless. We are the only state that shields bad actors from accountability in such a sweeping way. Governor, this bill is about doing what’s right, not what’s easy,” Trabulsy, a Republican from Fort Pierce, wrote.

The issue of justice, legal justice, you know, economic damages, noneconomic damages, there simply isn't enough justice to go around and have the system be able to stand up on its two feet.


– State Surgeon General Joseh Ladapo


Ladapo acknowledged not being versed in legal matters but said he had been researching different states’ policies when it comes to medical malpractice.
“The issue of justice, legal justice — you know, economic damages, noneconomic damages — there simply isn’t enough justice to go around and have the system be able to stand up on its two feet. It’s just not possible. And the correct, I mean the right thing, to do, just the wise thing to do in that situation, is to have caps,” he said.
“Frankly it’s insane to have a system with no caps on non-economic damages and expect for that system to continue to sustain itself and function as it was intended to function, which is to provide care for patients. That’s just not possible.”
The free-kill law has been in place for decades, having been signed by then-Gov. Lawton Chiles. The measure prevents parents of single, childless, adult children (25 and older) and adult children of single parents from suing hospitals and physicians fr non-economic damages if alleged malpractice resulted in death.
  Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large
Florida has had no caps on pain and suffering awards in medical malpractice lawsuits since 2017, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled them unconstitutional. But the makeup of the court has changed since then, with the majority of the justices having been appointed by DeSantis. 
The medical community is eager to put the rejuggled court to the test and, to that end, supported HB 6017 with the caveat that it include caps on non-economic damages in all medical malpractice lawsuits.
“Florida is in a medical negligence insurance crisis. Significantly expanding medical malpractice liability for the state’s physicians and hospitals without any guardrails, as HB 6017 would do if enacted into law, would be catastrophic for Florida’s healthcare system and the families that depend on it,” Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large said in a written statement to the Florida Phoenix. 
Large, who joined the governor at the press conference, said the legislation “proposed only to expand liability for our healthcare community without any safeguards to ensure that Florida’s healthcare system and residents do not suffer as a result. Gov. DeSantis courageously stood with our health care delivery heroes in vetoing this legislation.” 
Large says a recent benchmark study conducted by Aon and the American Society for Health Care Risk Management determined that, although the frequency of hospital and physician professional liability or medical professional liability claims has remained relatively stable in recent years, the severity of claims — including indemnity and defense costs per claim — has been steadily increasing. For instance, 10% of claims closed in Florida in 2023 were in excess of $1 million, compared to 7.5% nationwide.
The increasing costs mean increasing medical malpractice premiums, he said. Citing the Medical Liability Monitor October 2024 survey, Large added that Florida has experienced a notable 4.7% increase in med-mal premiums, whereas the regional average increase was 2.1%.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan says a new attack ad launched by the party he was a member of until last year is an example of the type of political system he’s campaigning against in his independent bid for governor.
The Democratic Governors Association launched a digital ad Thursday accusing Duggan of a “long, corruption-riddled history.”
A press release from the group points to federal agents saying in 2022 that they had linked Duggan to a chain of events that ultimately outed a confidential FBI informant, alerting a target of an ongoing investigation of bribery, extortion and fraud.
“As Mayor, Mike Duggan put himself and his corrupt insiders first, including apparently trying to undermine a federal investigation into one of his closest political allies who went to prison for accepting bribes,” said DGA Communications Director Sam Newton.

During his keynote address at the Mackinac Policy Conference on Wednesday, Duggan railed against attack ads used by both Democrats and Republicans.
He pointed to an ad the campaign of Curtis Hertel ran accusing Tom Barrett of writing a bill that put women and doctors in jail, and Barrett’s campaign countering with an ad accusing Hertel of working for the Chinese Communist Party.
“How did we get here, to the point where fighting for our state is not as important as being angry with the other party,” Duggan said.
Duggan added that Republicans are already running attack ads against U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) despite not having a candidate in the 2026 race yet.
“They have no idea who their candidate is. But they know if there’s only two choices … if we just make the Democrat terrible, we can win,” Duggan said. “We are not going to be living in a state where you only have these ads two or three months a year. We’re heading to a state where 12 months a year, year in, year out, we’re going to have toxic ads.”
The mayor said in an interview with the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the new DGA ad demonstrates his point.
“The Democrats are nothing if not predictable. They only know one thing: Tear down their opponents,” Duggan said. “I said yesterday that Democrats only united on two principles: They hate Republicans in general, and they hate Donald Trump in particular. But today, I’ve gotten them to broaden their platform; now they hate me, too.”
Duggan, for his part, is also running ads, though they are focused on his own campaign: Billboards along I-75 in northern Michigan declares Nov. 3, 2026, “Independent’s Day.”
He told reporters Wednesday that the series of billboards were meant to welcome people back as they drove up for the Mackinac Policy Conference.
Other candidates in the race to succeed the term-limited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer include Democrats; Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and Republicans; U.S. Rep. John James, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Attorney General Mike Cox and former congressional nominee Anthony Hudson.
Polling commissioned by the Detroit Regional Chamber and released on the first day of the conference shows Duggan’s campaign could pull votes from both Democrats and Republicans.
Duggan said during the keynote that his inclusion in the race makes it more difficult for either party to win by simply attacking the other side.
“If I come along, and there’s a third choice, you can’t just kill one party and automatically win,” Duggan said. “You have to actually say what you’re for.”
He told the Michigan Advance that Democrats are “making it really easy for people to make a choice.”
“But just once, wouldn’t you like to see the Democrats put up a billboard that says, here’s our housing policy? They don’t have it in them,” Duggan said.

(Joe Bueter/National Park Service)Firefighters in Yellowstone National Park have controlled the first fire confirmed in the park in 2025, Yellowstone officials said Wednesday in a news release.
Hikers detected the wildland fire on the Bighorn Pass Trail on Monday.
The “creeping ground fire” burning in a mixed conifer forest is one tenth of an acre and was started by lighting, the park said. In an average year, the park counts roughly 24 fires, 80% of which are caused by lightning, according to data on Yellowstone’s website.
Yellowstone officials said Wednesday that parkwide fire danger for Yellowstone is low, and no fire restrictions are in place or planned for the time being.
 Yellowstone’s Biscuit Basin still closed after 2024 hydrothermal explosion

However, the Biscuit Basin area remains closed this summer.
Last summer, a hydrothermal explosion from the Black Diamond Pool in the Biscuit Basin area northwest of Old Faithful spewed debris, including rocks as wide as 3 feet, into the air and damaged a boardwalk.

The park’s website said the closure is in place “due to the possibility of another event” at the site along with the damage caused last year.
Earlier this month, Yellowstone Volcano Observatory scientists installed a new webcam in Biscuit Basin with static images that are updated every 15 minutes and can be viewed here.
“We hope that this new view is of interest to the public, and we are confident it will provide a new perspective on activity at Black Diamond Pool that will be useful for the ongoing assessment of hazards from the area,” said a U.S. Geological Survey, one of the agencies that’s part of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory.
As for fires, Yellowstone counted nine blazes in 2024, and it said all but one were caused by lightning. The largest one burned four acres. In 2023, all five fires were caused by lighting, and the largest was just half an acre.
“The Greater Yellowstone area is a fire-adapted ecosystem,” the park said. “Fire plays an important role in maintaining the health of this area’s wildlife habitat and vegetation.”

SPRINGFIELD — In the backstretch of the legislative session, horse racing advocates are pushing to revitalize the industry in Illinois and its accompanying horse betting, both long in decline.

City officials from Decatur and Illinois horse racing advocates joined an effort this week by Sen. Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, to push lawmakers to approve legislation intended to revive a long-stalled south suburban “racino” and open a path for a new racetrack and gaming facility in Decatur.

Joyce’s bill, Senate Bill 1473, would undo part of a 2019 law that gave Hawthorne Race Course, a gambling course in Stickney, authority to veto other racecourse developments within 35 miles surrounding their suburban Chicago location. At the same time, it would make way to build a new racecourse in Decatur. The proposed development would include grandstands, a sports complex, hotels, restaurants, a gaming facility and a training center.

As video gambling soared in popularity, Illinois in 2019 tied horse gambling to its success by issuing new casino licenses for exclusively joint horse racing-casino ventures — so-called “racinos.” Advocates say the revenue from video gambling helps incentivise participation in the horse racing industry by providing for larger payouts..

“The amount of people that feed (horses), train them, auto lock them, the veterinarians, blacksmiths. … There's a lot of employment that goes along with these tracks,” Joyce said at a Senate Executive Committee hearing Wednesday. “Illinois used to be a powerhouse in harness racing and horse breeding.”

Despite the 2019 law and repeated promises from Hawthorne’s president, Tim Carey, the company has yet to begin development on its racino. Representatives said the track has been unable to secure financing.

The Decatur facility advocates want to move forward with private funding.

“A project of this scope and magnitude would be trailblazing for Decatur and our surrounding communities. It’s time for central Illinois, with the help of our local and state leaders, to be at the forefront of reviving this industry,” said Nicole Bateman, president of the Economic Development Corporation of Decatur-Macon County.

Joyce’s bill has received blowback from small businesses in Decatur, who fear a “racino” of this scale might oversaturate the town’s already thriving gambling market.

Rep. Brad Stephens, R-Rosemont, said he’s concerned the projected growth associated with allowing gambling terminals at horse tracks might come at the expense of Illinois’ growing video gambling industry:

“Are we just cannibalizing one industry for another?” Stephens asked.

The bill has received nearly 300 witness slips in opposition, many coming from small businesses in Decatur, compared with about 1,000 witness slips in support. Much of the Decatur opposition stems from business owners who rely on revenue from video gaming terminals and worry that a nearby racino would draw gamblers away from their businesses.

Jeff Davis, president of the Illinois Harness Horsemen’s Association, countered that casinos and video gambling attract different customers, so he expects the proposed development in Decatur won’t affect local businesses with video gambling machines.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, indicated frustration at Wednesday’s hearing that Hawthorne Race Course has for too long failed to attract investment in its racecourse/casino development plans.

“How long do we give you? 10, 20, 30 years?” Harmon asked a Hawthorne representative at the hearing before voting for the bill’s passage in committee.

At a news conference Wednesday, Gov. JB Pritzker said that while he’s enthusiastic about any exurban or rural development program, he has yet to take a position on this bill.

Joyce has been working on similar initiatives to support Illinois’ horse betting industry for years. While debate might still drag into the summer, the senator holds hope for the bill to pass this session, which ends Saturday.

Problem gambling has been recognized by medical experts as a health concern, and video gambling machines, in particular, have been called one of the most harmful forms of gambling at an individual level, especially for gambling addicts.

With or without the video gambling industry, the horse-racing industry faces many economic headwinds and a dwindling fanbase.

Some animal rights organizations believe the industry’s declining support is linked to a growing concern for the horses’ safety.

“The American public has decided that it no longer wishes to support entertainment in which animals die,” said Kathy Guillermo, senior vice president of PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

Both New York and Florida’s legislatures have considered decoupling the race-horsing and video-gambling industries this year, but so far neither has done so.

Advocates in Illinois, meanwhile, predicted the industry would see a resurgence in Illinois if the legislation authorizing new tracks clears the General Assembly.

(Photo Illustration by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lawmakers passed two bills to expand testing for contaminants in private wells in the state. 
On Thursday, the Maine Senate passed LD 493, which will require landlords of residential buildings who have private wells to test the water for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly called PFAS, every five years and share those results with the tenants. The bill does not require them to treat the water if contaminants are found. 
Support from the upper chamber came after the House of Representatives voted 78-69 on Wednesday to pass it.
Beyond more robust testing for renters’ wells, the Legislature also passed LD 500 this week to add PFAS to the list of contaminants the Department of Health and Human Services recommends testing for in private wells. The proposal would also provide free well water testing for low-income residents.
The House of Representatives passed the bill with a 79-66 vote. 
Both bills still need enactment votes from each chamber. But before heading to Gov. Janet Mills for final approval, they will likely end up on the special appropriations table. LD 500 has a fiscal note of about $150,000 a year, while LD 493 is projected to cost between $110,000 and $125,000 annually. 
More than half of Mainers get their drinking water from private drinking wells, which aren’t regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Landlords are already required to test for arsenic in wells that provide drinking water and share the test results with tenants within 10 days of being notified of the results. The new legislation builds upon that by requiring landlords to also test the water for PFAS, and other potentially harmful contaminants including lead and uranium. 
PFAS have been linked to health concerns including cancer, liver damage, pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol levels and more. PFAS contamination in water is a concern in Maine not only from the historic practice of spreading chemical-laden sludge on farmland, but also from spills of toxic firefighting foam like the one in Brunswick last summer as well as landfill leachate. 
“There is enormous mental stress associated in wondering whether your drinking water is making you sick,” said Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono), who sponsored LD 493, during discussion on the House floor.
Some House Republicans opposed LD 493, arguing that landlords may have to raise rents to cover the cost of testing, which goes against affordable housing priorities.
When discussing LD 500, Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), who co-chairs the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, argued that “paying for these tests is much more affordable than the health care costs associated with PFAS.”

Kelly Murphy (D-Scarborough). (Photo by Getty Images)Legislation to establish a fund to financially help students avoid homelessness passed both chambers of the Maine Legislature this week. 
The bill, LD 384, would allocate up to $750 per academic year to the family or guardian of a student at risk of homelessness for housing-related needs, which could include rental assistance, utilities, critical home repairs and transportation. In light of increasing student homelessness, the disruptions to students’ learning caused by housing insecurity, in addition to a lack of available assistance to prevent homelessness, the bill was “perhaps one of the most impactful bills that the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee heard this session,” according to committee co-chair Rep. Kelly Murphy (D-Scarborough).
The Maine Senate passed the bill on Wednesday with 28 members voting in favor and only six opposed. The House of Representatives had a narrower margin, with 81 members voting Thursday in favor of the bill and 62 opposed. The bill will go back to both chambers for final enactment votes.
Sponsor Sen. Joe Rafferty (D-York), who also co-chairs the education committee, explained that the bill builds on a pilot program approved in the 131st Legislature, which succeeded in helping more than 800 students. Several administrators who spoke at the public hearing vouched for the support they were able to provide struggling students in their districts through the pilot program, which LD 384 would make permanent. 
“It breaks my heart to know that there are students throughout Maine who are struggling with housing insecurity and don’t know where they’re going to sleep each night,” Rafferty said during the Senate floor discussion Wednesday. “The bill before us today would continue with this good work by permanently establishing a program so that our students can grow up and learn without worrying about where they’re going to sleep. It is the right thing to do.”
In Maine, the number of unhoused students has increased from 2,317 students in the 2021-22 school year to more than 5,000 in the 2023-24 school year, Murphy said.
Opponents of the bill in both chambers said the intent was noble, but took issue with the $1.5 million fiscal note. Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham) also questioned how much the one-time payment would help families avoid homelessness in the long term. 
“If a family is already on the brink, this amount is unlikely to provide lasting stability” she said. “We’re offering a temporary fix to a systematic problem without addressing the root causes.” 
During the public hearing, Mallory Cook, director of training and early educator engagement for the Maine Education Association, cited a Maine Housing Coalition report from 2020 that said a vast majority of Maine tenants only owed between $1,000 and $1,500 to their landlords, making the $750 per student annual allocation in LD 384 critical in preventing student homelessness.
“It’s not a lot of money, but oftentimes when we’ve reached a crisis situation in these families, $750 does make the difference between being evicted or having your utility shut off,” Murphy said Thursday. “This is one way to prevent student homelessness and to ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed.”
Sen. James Libby (R- Cumberland) said given the current budget deficit the bill was not likely to be funded and would likely languish on the appropriations table, where bills not provided for in the budget compete for remaining funds. 
Under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, all students experiencing homelessness are entitled to a free, appropriate public education. But it does not allocate any money to prevent homelessness, Murphy pointed out.
This week the Legislature also passed another bill, LD 747, which directs the Maine Housing Authority to develop a program to provide assistance to homeless students in coordination with the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services.

Kehoe and legislative leaders insist on using taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars for a half billion dollar (or more) handout to billionaire sports team owners in a standalone bill, the Missouri Freedom Caucus will vote against such a proposal and will consider utilizing any tools at its disposal to stop it,” state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, said in a statement on behalf of the four-member Senate Freedom Caucus. 
From the left, Democrats are seething that the governor’s agenda for the special session includes hundreds of millions for stadiums but only $25 million in disaster recovery funds for victims of recent tornadoes in the St. Louis region.
“The conversation can’t even begin until serious disaster relief is considered,” said state Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat. “Why do I care about a billionaire’s stadium when people have lost their homes?  There’s absolutely no way we’re going to serve a billionaire a feast and leave crumbs for people who just lost their homes. That’s not happening.”
Complicating all calculations is the Democratic fury over how the regular session ended. Republicans used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and paid sick leave. 
Democrats promised the Senate would not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
On Thursday, Democrats showed just how disruptive they could be when Webber halted the routine work of signing bills from the regular session by noting that the chamber lacked a quorum because a majority of senators were not present. 
The Senate was stuck as it waited for GOP legislators to make the unplanned trip to Jefferson City from their homes for what was supposed to be a largely ceremonial day.
Then Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, an Affton Democrat, made a motion to adjourn the session for the year. Without voting on that motion, Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, adjourned the Senate until Friday so more members could be rounded up.
“It’s not coming together just swimmingly as of right now,” said state Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee.
A decade after losing an NFL team, Missouri lawmakers set to debate stadium funding plan

The delaying action Thursday was about how the regular session ended, Beck said in an interview. He said he hasn’t had enough conversations with members of his caucus to decide tactics for the special session.
“The only part of the special session I think would be critical would be trying to get some relief for the people of the city of St Louis after the tornado,” Beck said. “There’s some hard feelings out there about how things happened. There’s also a feeling of like the amount of aid that they’ve offered is kind of a slap in the face.”
On Tuesday, Kehoe announced he was calling the legislature back into session to approve $25 million in disaster recovery funds and a little over $200 million in construction projects that failed to win House approval during the regular session.
But the highest profile piece of Kehoe’s special session agenda is his plan for the state to pay up to half the costs of a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals and renovations to Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs — projects estimated to cost up to $3 billion.
Both teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums expire in 2030, and Kansas lawmakers have put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins told The Kansas City Star on Thursday that if the Chiefs or Royals are interested in leaving Missouri, they should act on the state’s offer soon before the deal expires at the end of June.
Kehoe argues that the cost to keep the teams in the state would be less than what Missouri stands to lose if either team leaves the state. He claims the economic activity associated with the Chiefs supports 4,500 jobs, while a new stadium for the Royals would generate about 8,400 jobs. 
But while the proposal easily cleared the Missouri House in the legislative session’s final days, it died in the Senate. 
A bipartisan filibuster derailed its progress, with complaints ranging from the price tag to the lack of legislative input on the plan. 
Senators also complained that stadium funding was taking precedence over $500 million in construction projects killed by the House days earlier that would have funded eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
How opposition in the Senate plays out — the Senate will take up the special session bills first because of anticipated difficulty — will decide what the House can do.
State Rep. Doug Clemens, a Democrat from St. Ann, applauded the moves Thursday to disrupt the normally routine Senate action.
“It’s high time that Democrats dig their heels in and I support this,” Clemens said. “The governor needs to sit down and negotiate with Senate Democrats if we’re going to change things we’re going to make government work for the people.”
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Republican from Lee’s Summit said he’s ready to act on Kehoe’s package but knows things could change.
“This is politics and negotiating is all part of it,” Patterson said. “There may be negotiations ahead but we will take a look at the current package and move ahead.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said she’s generally supportive of the items Kehoe is requesting but would like to see more for disaster aid and construction spending. 
What happens in the Senate, she said, is the key to the special session.
“The tenor in the Senate is probably going to dictate a lot of what happens,” Aune said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Kehoe’s special session agenda includes very little of the construction budget spending, creating blowback. Instead of $50 million originally slated for the University of Missouri nuclear reactor, the governor called for only $25 million. 
“The governor’s office gave me their word on $50 million, and I expect not one penny less than that,” Webber said. “I’m genuinely perplexed why they would give me their word then go back on it. I didn’t play games with them, and I don’t understand why they are playing games with my district.”
Hough also said the capital construction bill should spend more. And he questions whether the state should start paying for disaster recovery in cases where FEMA is not participating.
The $25 million proposal, he said, “is kind of like a drop in the bucket. That’s also why the state doesn’t do disaster payments, generally, because we don’t have a printing press like the feds.”
Republicans hold a super majority in the Senate — 24 of 34 seats. But it’s unclear if there are 18 GOP votes in support of Kehoe’s stadium plan, meaning Democratic support may be crucial. 
Kehoe has a big hammer to sway votes — there are 248 items added to the budget by lawmakers at a cost of $550 million that are in bills awaiting his action. Kehoe has the power to veto any item from the budget he doesn’t like.
“I’ve got members calling me saying, is he gonna veto my stuff?” Hough said.
Kehoe will have to use every bit of his political skills to win passage of the special session package.
“The easiest way to frame this, from my perspective right now, is that there’s an awful lot of negotiation still yet to be done,” Hough said. “It’s just not as simple as everyone’s going to show back up after the way the session ended.”
A spokeswoman for the governor said he “respects the legislative process and hopes that legislators will work together to deliver on the time-sensitive issues in his call for the special session.”

Rick Scott speaking in Clearwater on May 28, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Rick Scott has always been a deficit hawk, sometimes to his political peril, so it’s no surprise that he’s among a group of Republican U.S. senators seeking significant changes to President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
The budget and tax bill passed the GOP-controlled U.S. House of Representatives by a single vote last week.
“The package that just passed the House will take the deficit in 10 years from $37 trillion to close to $60 trillion,” Scott said Wednesday in Clearwater after holding a press conference on hurricane preparedness.
“We’re already spending more than 20% of your revenues that you’re going to give us, in your tax dollars, to interest. That’s not sustainable.”
The Penn Wharton University of Pennsylvania Budget Model estimates that passage of the legislation as its written right now would raise the federal deficit by more than $3 trillion over the next 10 years. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, disputes that calculation, insisting the bill “saves” more than $1.6 trillion in mandatory spending.
Scott’s concerns about federal spending led to his “12-point plan to Rescue America” that he unveiled in 2022 when he served as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
The plan called for sunsetting all federal legislation every five years, including Social Security and Medicare — a proposal so unpopular that it was opposed by then GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and mocked by President Joe Biden, ultimately leading the Florida Republican to remove those two major entitlement programs from his proposal.
Scott praised the House for passing the bill last week, and emphasized that “I completely agree with President Trump’s agenda,” which he said included securing the southern border, building up the military, and making the 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire later this year, permanent. “Those are all things that we ought to do,” he said.
Scott was re-elected to the Senate last year over Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by 13 points, by far his largest margin of victory in his four statewide races in Florida over the past 14 years, with the three previous races all decided by a margin of one percentage point or less.
Pre-pandemic levels
Scott said that Congress needs to continue to work on reducing federal spending.
“We had a 53% increase in spending in five years, a 53% increase,” he said. “Population’s only up 2%. There’s probably a little bit of waste in there. So I think we need to go back to pre-pandemic spending.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been critical of the tax and spending package, noting his disappointment that the budget cuts made by Elon Musk and his “Department of Government Efficiency” this year that were not included in the House bill.
“To see Republicans in Congress cast aside any meaningful reductions (and in fact, fully fund things like USAID) is demoralizing and represents a betrayal of the voters who elected him,” the governor said on X on Tuesday.
But as Scott noted Wednesday, under Senate rules, only mandatory spending can be placed in a reconciliation bill, which is what is what the House passed last week. DOGE cuts are considered discretionary spending.
“DOGE has shown us that there’s a lot of waste in the [budget], so we’ve got to do both of these,” Scott said. “If we don’t, here’s what’s going to happen. Interest rates are not going to come down. If we keep borrowing $2 trillion every year, inflation’s not going away, interest rates are not coming down. Just this year, we need to refinance over $9 trillion worth of Treasuries and sell another $2 trillion.”
Separately, the White House is expected to send its “rescission package” to the House soon, which will include the DOGE cuts, House Speaker Mike Johnson said on X on Wednesday.
Scott says that he’s going to work hard to find cuts in the tax and spending package, and is confident he’ll be able to pass the legislation when it’s ready to go sometime later this summer.
“We’ll get a bill done,” he said. “The goal is to get it done by the 4th of July. We have to get it done probably by the end of July because of the debt ceiling, but I think the bill will pass.”
Every Democratic member of the House opposed the spending and tax package last week, and are highlighting major cuts to Medicaid and food assistance as a reason why the public should oppose it as well.

,DC,2025-05-29 17:41:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Immigrants in U.S. without permanent legal status grew to 12.2 million, study finds",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigrants-us-without-permanent-legal-status-grew-122-million-study-finds,,"WASHINGTON — The Center for Migration Studies Thursday released a report finding the population of people in the United States without permanent legal status increased to 12.2 million in 2023, using the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey data.It’s a number that grew by 2 million from 2020 to 2023, according to the study by the nonpartisan New York think tank that studies domestic and international migration. Six states that have the largest population of people without permanent legal status also saw some of the biggest increases. They are California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Of those states, the fastest-growing were Florida, New York and New Jersey.That population estimate includes not only people in the U.S. without legal authorization, but immigrants in programs that provide temporary legal status. That would include programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and Temporary Protected Status, as well as people with pending asylum cases or who received humanitarian parole status since 2021.The study noted that estimating the size of the population without permanent legal status could “become even more challenging in the next few years” because the census data collection could be affected by mass firings of federal workers as the Trump administration aims to cull the federal workforce.Authors of the study also took into consideration the Trump administration’s efforts to enact mass deportations and how the population could decline, not due to removals but rather a decrease in the number of immigrants responding to survey data.“The salient questions would be: Did the decline occur because deportations increased, including of populations stripped of temporary legal status, because fear led to an increase in emigration, because fear reduced the response rates in the surveys, or because of a combination of these or other factors?,” according to the study.The annual report from the think tank runs counter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s congressional testimony in May to Senate appropriators that there are more than 20 million people in the country without legal authorization.Other think tanks that study migration, such as the Migration Policy Institute, have estimated as of 2021, there were 11.2 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization.Venezuelan migrantsOne major finding in the study by the Center for Migration Studies was that the population of Venezuelan immigrants increased from 55,000 in 2013 to 220,000 in 2020.According to the study, that population then doubled in 2023 to 445,000, which is around the time the Biden administration granted TPS protections for a second group of Venezuelans after granting TPS for a first group of Venezuelans in 2021. Roughly half a million Venezuelans are under the TPS program and are at risk of losing protections from deportation.That program allows nationals from countries deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, political instability or other unstable conditions to remain in the U.S. for up to 18 months unless their protections are renewed by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary.The Trump administration is moving to end TPS for Venezuelans and invoked an 18th-century wartime law to rapidly deport any Venezuelan national 14 and older who is suspected of gang ties.The Supreme Court has blocked the use of the wartime law over concerns of due process, and has not ruled on the constitutionality of using the law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. But the high court is allowing the Trump administration to continue its efforts to end TPS for Venezuelans who were granted protections in 2023.Central American migrantsThe study also found the population of Central American immigrants grew by 1.2 million from 2013 to 2023. With the highest levels of migration at the southern border in 20 years, the Biden administration in January 2023 created a program to allow nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela – nearly all from Central America – to be sponsored with work visas and have deportation protections.Roughly 532,000 people are in that program. The Trump administration has made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to end it, potentially opening those immigrants up to rapid deportation.",,,,2025-05-29 14:07:39.809837

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Earlier this month, hundreds of art groups across the United States were informed they were about to lose a source of their funding: federal grants from the National Endowment for the Arts.
The change was in response to a letter from the White House outlining President Donald Trump’s recommendations for funding levels in the upcoming 2025-26 fiscal year. Among the changes outlined was a recommendation for the elimination of all funding for the NEA.
“The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president,” an email to grant recipients stated.
Iowa is home to several arts organizations, including dedicated non-profit movie theaters such as The Varsity Cinema in Des Moines and the FilmScene in Iowa City. Both of these organizations have been informed their NEA funding will be terminated for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
“To have something like this was really kind of an ongoing support at a substantial level, you know? There’s just not an obvious replacement for that,” said Ben Godar, executive director of Des Moines Film, the nonprofit that operates The Varsity Cinema in the Drake University neighborhood.
Godar believes the presence of a nonprofit theater has greatly impacted the local community through community partnership screenings and the accessibility it provides to its audience. Godar says he is proud the Varsity regularly makes accessible screenings, such as open-caption movies every Monday or sensory-friendly screenings.
The community partnership screenings are one of the biggest areas of impact to the local community, he added. The screenings combine the Varsity’s mission to promote film arts with local non-profits to combine their missions in an event that speaks to both organizations’ audiences. These screenings act as a way to connect local groups with the local film community in a “collaborative and organic” way, he said.
According to Godar, without the federal grants the programs may need to be cut back, but the Varsity will not be closing its doors.
The money from NEA grants accounts for a relatively small amount of total revenue – around 2%, or $20,000. While this loss is “certainly a concern,” Godar says it is not a catastrophic amount. The larger challenge for arts organizations, he said, is that there are relatively few grant programs that nonprofits can consistently rely on for funding, year after year.
Grant changes align with ‘the president’s priorities’ 
FilmScene, founded in 2011, is another nonprofit film organization in Iowa. They were established to address a “missing piece” of Iowa City’s cultural community, as there was then no downtown movie theater or full-time, art house, independent cinema.
“These are films that are presented to better understand the world we live in, to give us a window into a world outside our own,” said Andrew Sherburne, executive director of FilmScene. “All of that, I think, is to serve the curiosity that so many of our patrons have to better understand their world.”
FilmScene now serves around 80,000 people per year, in part through FilmScene at the Chauncey, a three-screen venue in downtown Iowa City, along College and Gilbert streets, and FilmScene on the Ped Mall, located in the restored 1850s Provisions and Packing Building in downtown Iowa City. 
The NEA has said it intends to “prioritize projects that elevate the Nation’s HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian-American communities.”
Sherburne stated the new NEA priorities “reflect some other priorities of the administration, but they really don’t have anything to do with the arts.” Godar also commented on these “seemingly random” priorities saying it’s “frustrating” that funding was terminated not through a change in overall public opinion but “because of the president’s priorities.”
FilmScene currently has no plans to change its programming. Several programs that FilmScene committed were to be funded by the NEA but FilmScene now plans to find other ways to support the programs and continue as planned. Sherburne says continued funding challenges may impact programming in the years to come, but the community response has left him hopeful for the organization’s future.
“Just keep showing up, that is the most important way that folks can support whatever cultural institution they care about most,” he said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9873-small.jpg,,,2025-05-29 14:07:39.809837

The auditor at the Mississippi Department of Transportation had wanted to run for city council for years, but she started seriously considering it after purchasing her first family home in Northpointe, a northeast Jackson neighborhood, in 2019. 
It seemed to her like the city could use her accounting expertise, but she was uncertain if a young Black woman could be a viable candidate in Ward 1, an area long known as Jackson’s “white Republican bastion.”  
“I knew that if you’re gonna run against a white Republican in a ward like this, you’re gonna have to have your A-game,” she said. 
In an attempt to convince Barnes, her campaign manager and friend sent out a poll in late December, asking frequent voters in the ward if they were satisfied with the incumbent Ashby Foote, the founder of a financial services company who was elected to the council in 2014 as a Republican and has not faced a serious challenger since. 
Over half of respondents said they would consider somebody else, Barnes said. 
Now, as Ward 1 residents start voting for the June 3 general election, Barnes and fellow challenger, independent Grace Greene, are creating stiff competition for Foote who is also running as an independent. 
The hotly contested race reflects what political observers and ward residents have known for years now: Northeast Jackson is not quite the “white Republican bastion” it once was. 
In 2024, Ward 1 was recorded as having 1,000 more Black residents than white, a ratio of nearly 50% to 45%, after redistricting prompted by the 2020 census. That same year, the ward voted overwhelmingly for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump during the presidential election.
To be sure, Ward 1 is still the city’s whitest ward, home to influential Republican donors who live in some of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the state. And these voters carry greater weight in municipal races, where turnout is lower, a trend that historically favors the affluent and conservative. In this year’s Democratic primary, Ward 1 recorded the highest voter turnout in the city – 30% versus 23% citywide – leading some pundits to cry Republican interference.

Ward 1 is economically diverse, with some of Jackson’s biggest mansions as well as several apartment complexes. 
But many of the ward’s civically engaged residents, regardless of race, political party or the nexis of the two, are united by shared interests, such as preserving property values in an area that has not suffered as much as other parts of the city from population loss, crime or divestment but where there is financially more at stake. 
“I’m gonna go back to: We need help,” Madeline Cannon, a Ward 1 resident for nearly 60 years, said as she was leaving a candidate forum at the Briarwood Presbyterian Church last week. “Right now, I’m looking for a leader. I am a Democrat. I’ve been a Democrat all my life. But we’re just looking for a leader.” 
For residents, their relationships with their council person matters much more, Cannon said, than political party. 
Greene said she recently experienced this firsthand at a meet-and-greet at the Country Club of Jackson hosted by a friend who is involved with the neighborhood association. Greene was prepared for residents to ask her questions about Rodney DePriest, a white businessman who is running as an independent candidate for mayor. 
Instead, Greene said nearly everyone wanted to know if she knew Horhn, who had just secured the Democratic nomination. 
“Then some of the people who were coming up to me, introducing themselves to me were like, ‘We’ve already spoken to John Horhn about this, we’re doing this … or we worked with John for years about this or he’s been supportive about this in the Senate, whatever business or philanthropic thing these people had worked on, and it was very obvious they had good relationships with him and a respect for him,” she said, “and like, in their minds, it was almost settled, even though we had a general election.” 
When Jackson adopted a mayor-council form of government and created the city’s seven wards 40 years ago, Ward 1 voters elected a Democrat. But ever since 1993, when insurance agency president Derwood Boyles stepped down, Ward 1 has been represented by a Republican. 
Political scientist Steve Rozman, a retired Tougaloo College professor who lived in north Jackson for years, has a few possible explanations for why northeast Jackson became and has remained the whitest, wealthiest and most conservative part of the city.
Jackson was developed as a segregated city, and Rozman speculated the city’s desirable land was close to the Pearl River. Indeed, one of Jackson’s most premier neighborhoods, Eastover, was developed in 1949 by Leland Speed Sr., a former mayor of Jackson, on a horse farm on low-lying land near the river. 
“Whites set up on the land that they regarded as best in the area,” he said. “A lot of the Black neighborhoods historically have not been near the Pearl River. With the municipal water system, maybe it was advantageous under more primitive conditions to be near water.” 
As the 20th century wore on, factors like redlining, higher property values and significant opposition from racist white people would have kept Black Jacksonians from purchasing homes in the city’s northeast until the 1990s and 2000s, Rozman said. 
Today, northeast Jackson is home to large apartment complexes near County Line Road and I-55 as well as a growing Hispanic population, a diversity that Barnes said people don’t often acknowledge. Instead, folks still tend to associate northeast Jackson with its tennis courts, private schools and gated neighborhoods. 
“I don’t know if it’s like a perception thing,” she said.

In reality, the ward’s demographics represent a marked shift from 1992, when Ward 1 was 92% white, according to the Northside Sun. 
Back then, Ward 1 was one of three majority white wards in the city, along with wards 4 and 6 in southwestern Jackson. But by 2000, before the city had even received the final Census tally, Ward 1’s councilperson, Ben Allen, was telling his constituents that would no longer be possible. 
“It would be very difficult for us to get three white wards, unless some fancy gerrymandering goes on,” Allen told the Northside Sun. 
Come 2002, redistricting dropped Ward 1’s white population to 76%, according to newspaper archives. The balance would shift again in 2010, to 55.9% white and 39.7% Black.
With the exception of a few closely contested special elections, the ward has remained a Republican stronghold this century, as Democrats often failed to field any candidates. But when they did, the race could be close: In 2014, Foote was elected by a little over 100 votes against construction attorney Dorsey Carson. It was technically a nonpartisan special election, and Carson, a Democrat, reportedly “strayed from discussing his political affiliation,” while Foote emphasized his conservative values. 
Now the sole Republican on the council, Foote said when it came time for him to participate in drawing new ward lines last year, he didn’t do so with his reelection chances in mind in part because the process did not affect his constituency’s racial balance. 
Of the couple thousand voters that Ward 1 had to give up, Foote said they were about 50-50 Black-white.
Instead, Foote said his goal was to keep the shape and cohesiveness of Ward 1 “in a way that made logical sense and not get gerrymandered into something that looks like a lizard or whatever.”

The distant cousin of author Shelby Foote moved to Jackson in 1980. In 1999, he bought a home with his wife on Calnita Place, close to Jackson Academy — a feature Foote said he didn’t appreciate at the time because his children attended other schools, but has since come to see as protecting his property values. 
Plus, the cul de sac was good for his dog, Skip, a Jack Russell mix. 
“Your dog’s life expectancy goes up,” Foote said jokingly.  
As she has canvassed the ward, Barnes said she’s loved walking through the neighborhoods close to Jackson Academy. 
“I was like, man, this is a really cool community, and I just kind of love that aspect of kids walking by themselves because they feel safe enough to do that,” she said. 
That’s not the only similarity between Democrat and Republican in the Ward 1 race. When Barnes reads news articles about the city, she often ends up finding herself asking the same questions as Foote about financial transparency and accountability. 
“Jackson is in a vulnerable position, but we’re not a vulnerable city,” she said. “We have a lot that we can do internally to build our credibility, build our leverage first, and then we can go out and seek other resources.” 
Foote noted that if he were to lose reelection, the lack of a Republican on Jackson’s city council would not impact the issues of the day. 
“It’s not really about Republican values or Democrat values,” he said. “It’s really about let’s get the roads fixed, let’s make sure we have running water, let’s make sure the garbage is picked up, and let’s make sure we do it in a cost efficient manner.”
At the same time, Foote has touted in campaign materials that he is endorsed by the Hinds County Republican Party. He said his first run for office was financed by a generous donation from Billy Mounger, an architect of the state’s GOP who was good friends with Foote’s father. 
As for Greene, an entrepreneur who has worked as a doula, an online reseller, and an economic developer in Peru, said she chose to run as an independent so that residents of Ward 1, regardless of their political affiliation, will know she supports them. 
Greene moved to the ward in 2020 with her family after looking at homes in Belhaven, Fondren and LOHO, the neighborhood just outside of Eastover. They landed on a home in Heatherwood in part because it had an attached garage, a feature the older homes in Fondren lack.

Plus, she wanted to raise her kids, who are enrolled in Jackson Public Schools, in a diverse environment, a decision she has talked about with other white residents during the campaign. 
“There was somebody in the neighborhood who knew me from childhood and he made a comment about the changing demographics of the neighborhood. He said how initially he thought it was going to be a negative thing, but it just turned out to not be a negative thing. I just told him, I said, ‘Well that was a positive to us when we moved here,’” she said during an interview at her office in Highland Village. 
Greene also noted that everyone in the ward is impacted by the city’s actions, regardless of whether they live in an apartment or a gated community. For instance, she said she had two kids in diapers with no trash pick up for 18 days in 2023. 
“That was a leveler across the city, cause no matter where you lived, no one had trash pickup, and we all had to figure out what to do with this,” she said. “And the fact that there was truly, really no explanation to the citizens as to why this was happening? There was no response when we reached out about it.” 
Another leveler? When it’s the state versus Jackson, that includes the Republicans who live here, too. 
Foote shared a story about the controversy surrounding the Smith-Wills Stadium. At one point, frustrated by what he characterized as a lack of transparency from the city administration around a deal to forgive $500,000 in past-due rent from the stadium’s vendor, Foote said he asked Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office for an opinion on whether the vote the council took to do so was legal.
Even though Fitch is a fellow Republican, Foote said her office told him it would be a conflict of interest to opine on his question, since Fitch is representing the state in its fight to take the stadium.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20191429/3X0A4673.jpg,,,2025-05-29 14:07:39.809837

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)After Donald Trump tapped him as his running mate, J.D. Vance crisscrossed the country and gave speech after speech in which he, like Trump, demonized immigrants and promised to mount a mass deportation effort if elected.
The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.
An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country who are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.

Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May of 2018.

Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 is more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases. Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history prior to it becoming part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
  From ferrying travelers to deportees 

The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
  ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona 

ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft which had been used for deportations had been utilized by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had ongoing cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action lawsuit against the United States, where passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac, some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data is available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the (second) Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

(Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)This story was produced as part of the Pulitzer Center’s StoryReach U.S. Fellowship and the Public Media Accountability Initiative, which supports investigative reporting at local media outlets around the country. It was reported and edited by Northern Journaland APM Reports, with support from Alaska Public Media.
For decades, an economic catastrophe has been unfolding in the Indigenous villages along the Gulf of Alaska, with lost jobs and the destruction of a traditional way of life: hauling fish from the sea.
That destruction is still playing out. More than 80% of people who responded to a recent survey sponsored by an economic development nonprofit said that Southeast Alaska and Kodiak Island villages are in a “crisis of sustainability” because of lost access to fisheries.
Indigenous leaders across the Gulf say it’s imperative that Alaska legislators pass reforms to the state law that they blame for the mess: a landmark 1973 statute that effectively prevents many residents of those coastal villages from earning a living by fishing for salmon.
New fishermen can only participate in the commercial harvest if they buy or inherit a state permit that, in some cases, can cost upward of $100,000 — putting it out of reach for young rural residents with no credit histories.
“We all have kids and grandkids that want to continue doing what their grandparents were doing a long time ago,” Joe Nelson, a top official with Southeast Alaska regional Native corporation Sealaska, said at a reception for lawmakers in Juneau last month.

But just up the street from Sealaska’s offices, at the Alaska Capitol, the issue barely registers.
Many lawmakers in Juneau represent urban districts or regional population centers and aren’t aware of the crisis playing out in the state’s rural, coastal communities; instead, they’re focused on state schools funding and a widening budget deficit.
Those who do represent coastal areas say they have to balance the interests of village constituents with the interests of another, politically connected group: existing fishermen in hub towns and urban areas who depend on their harvests to feed their families — and who could be negatively affected by legislative change.
There’s also still no consensus among advocates about how, precisely, the law should be adjusted.
The result is that despite growing discontent with the 1973 law, and a widening coalition of stakeholders who support changing it, the issue has gone nowhere in Juneau. Advocates hoped for a hearing on the subject during this year’s legislative session, but one never materialized, and lawmakers have proposed no bills to address the problem.
“We’re operating under a law that’s been in place for 52 years, and it’s broke — it’s not meeting the demands of today,” said Robin Samuelsen, a Native leader from the salmon-rich region of Bristol Bay. The system needs to be changed, he said, or rural Alaska communities “are not going to survive.”
“One by one, they’re going to disappear,” he said.

The 1973 law, known as the Limited Entry Act, was designed to make commercial fishing more profitable and sustainable by limiting the number of boats on the water.
Skippers who had been operating at the time largely qualified for permits without having to buy them. But a provision called “free transferability” meant those permits could be sold on the open market. 
Over the years, rural Native communities have lost hundreds to Alaska’s larger population centers and other states as owners sold out or took permits with them when they moved.
Earlier this year, Northern Journal sent a survey on limited entry and rural fisheries access to 16 state senators and representatives whose districts border the Gulf of Alaska; none completed it. Approached by a reporter at the Capitol, several lawmakers declined to discuss the issues; some pleaded ignorance.
“We’re going to work on it, and we’ll try to do all we can,” Senate President Gary Stevens said. “But I don’t see any reason I need to meet with you on this.”

Stevens for 25 years has represented Kodiak Island, whose Indigenous villages were once home to proud commercial fishing fleets and a multi-generation heritage of fish-related trade. 
Those communities have seen some of the state’s steepest permit losses since lawmakers approved limited entry more than 50 years ago. 
One village, Ouzinkie, has a single skipper left in its harbor.
‘What’s the holdup?’
Butch Laiti started in the commercial fishing industry as a teenager in Juneau, where his family was part of a big Native fleet that harvested salmon from the Taku River outside of town.
At 76 years old, he’s watched for decades as members of his local tribe have sold off their boats and permits — making them largely bystanders as others harvest the salmon once claimed as tribal property.
Today, Laiti says he’s one of the few Native fishermen left in his area. And the Tlingit elder wants to pass his decades of maritime expertise and knowledge to a new generation.
Laiti is the president of a local tribal government, the Douglas Indian Association, and under his leadership, the tribe acquired a parcel of waterfront property in Juneau where it hopes to one day build a communally owned fish processing plant.
And, in 2022, the tribe spent $210,000 on a commercial fishing boat: a 42-foot gillnetter, which will double as a marine debris cleanup vessel.

Then, Laiti went to the state agency that oversees access to Alaska’s commercial fisheries to ask: Could the tribe also buy a permit to harvest salmon? That would give Laiti and other aging skippers the chance to take turns running the vessel and training aspiring young fishermen.
But the answer from the agency’s chairman was a hard no: The limited entry law only allows ownership by individuals, not by collectives such as companies or tribes. The lawmakers who designed the system in the 1970s wanted to keep fishing from being taken over corporate interests.
If the members of Laiti’s tribe want to own a permit and operate their boat collectively, they would have to change the law — a daunting proposition for an organization with no lobbyist and little muscle in Alaska’s Capitol.
But a broader network of advocates has also been readying an organized push for legislative reform. It includes the Indigenous-owned regional corporations for Southeast Alaska, Bristol Bay and Kodiak, along with The Nature Conservancy.
Those groups haven’t decided on specific legislative changes to push. But Laiti says that tribal ownership would be one straightforward fix to the limited entry law.
“This is ours. It always has been ours, and because we joined the United States of America, somehow we have lost control of everything that has belonged to us,” Laiti said. “If we’ve got to buy back our heritage, then so be it.”
He added a question for lawmakers: “What’s the holdup?”
‘Fiercely’ opposed
One reason for the holdup: the thousands of commercial fishermen who already own permits entitling them to chase a share of the harvest.

One group of such fishermen — a trade organization representing Southeast Alaska’s fleet of salmon gillnetters — ”fiercely” opposed a previous legislative proposal to allow community trusts to own permits, according to one of its leaders.
In an email, Max Worhatch, executive director of the United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, rejected the idea that lawmakers should change the permit system to boost rural fishermen.
Native corporations and a regional fisheries nonprofit in Bristol Bay have plenty of capital, Worhatch said, and both can “easily afford” to support rural residents seeking state loans that are available to all Alaskans.
In fact, that regional fisheries nonprofit, Bristol Bay Economic Development Corp., already has a program that subsidizes local permit ownership. But it hasn’t stopped permits from leaving the region, and in fact, the losses have still accelerated in recent years, according to state data.
“We don’t have enough candidates from our communities stepping forward,” said Samuelsen, who served as the nonprofit’s board chair for three decades. “A lot of them say, ‘We don’t have the capital or the money to get involved.’”
Defenders of the current system say that the decline of the commercial fishing industry in remote villages is less about the limited supply of permits and more about the lack of demand for them.
“There are not tons of folks breaking down the doors to get into fishing,” Jerry McCune, a longtime Cordova-based fisherman and trade group lobbyist, wrote in a response to a Northern Journal survey of industry players.
  The Alaska Fishermen’s Building in Juneau houses the United Fishermen of Alaska, or UFA, one of several industry trade groups with a presence at the Alaska Capitol, which is just down the street. (Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)
McCune and some other industry veterans argue that factors outside the state’s control are at play: closures of processing plants in remote areas, shifts in salmon runs and reduced competition among the seafood companies vying to buy each vessel’s catch.
They also worry that even small changes to the permit regime risk upending the whole limited entry system — and, potentially, invite legal challenges.
“Limited entry is a very complicated document,” McCune said. “Change one thing and limited entry could collapse.”
Attorneys for the state have raised questions about the constitutionality of ideas like permit trusts. 
But Jim Brennan, a longtime Alaska attorney who provided legal support to the attempt to create those trusts a decade ago, dismissed McCune’s concerns. The overall permit system, he said, has survived previous court challenges.
“I think that’s kind of a scare tactic,” he said. “It’s not a house of cards.”
‘Does it force the other side down?’
Lawmakers say they need to approach the issue of permit access deliberately — balancing the needs of rural communities with those of existing fishermen.
Kodiak Rep. Louise Stutes, who chairs the House Fisheries Committee, said in a statement that any legislative proposals would have to accommodate different constituencies.
“I certainly support reducing barriers to accessing fisheries for Alaskans and keeping permits in rural communities,” she said. “However, I also believe that any potential change to limited entry needs to be the result of a stakeholder-driven process with existing permit holders, rural constituents, affected communities and the Department of Fish and Game.”

The Alaska fishing industry’s own broader economic crisis is making the policy discussion even more sensitive. Oversupply, flagging demand and growing global competition have depressed prices paid to fishermen in recent years — putting many skippers in the red.
Sitka Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, who represents multiple Southeast Alaska fishing hub towns, as well as small Native communities that have seen sharp losses in permit ownership, said that the increasingly tough outlook for the industry has complicated the task for lawmakers.
“It’s really hard to say we’re going to come in and fix this problem that’s been cooking since 1970 — when people in the fishery now can’t even make their living,” she said.

Nonetheless, Himschoot added, she’s alarmed by permit losses in villages in her district and wants to explore ways to restore them without harming current permit owners. 
But she acknowledged that the issue is politically delicate. 
“When we lift up one side, does it force the other side down?” she asked.

Henifin said residents will have a chance to give testimony to Wingate during the next status conference scheduled for June 16 at 1 p.m. at the federal courthouse in downtown Jackson, and that JXN Water will put out further instructions on how to participate. This story will be updated with any additional details.

The utility announced in February that it would raise rates for the second time in as many years after realizing it would need more revenue for operations and debt payments than it previously estimated. Henifin said that would be the case even if JXN Water had a 100% collections rate, adding Wednesday that the rate is now around 70%. 
While the 2022 federal consent decree employing Henifin requires him to present rate increase proposals to the Jackson City Council, he only needs Wingate’s approval to enact them. In the two and half years since Wingate appointed Henifin to lead the city’s water system out of disrepair, the judge has largely aligned with the manager’s outlook. 
In 2023, for instance, the judge brushed off concerns a number of advocates and residents raised over a lack of transparency and local engagement from JXN Water. Wingate also sided with Henifin in a couple of disputes with federal agencies pver part of the consent decree: During status conferences last year, Henifin criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for slowing down funding dispersals, and also asked Wingate to mandate the release of SNAP participant data to implement a water bill discount.
The judge agreed with Henifin in both instances, although a 5th Circuit U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision last month halted the release of SNAP data. Henifin said Wednesday he hopes JXN Water can work with government agencies during future SNAP re-enrollment to advertise the discount. 
JXN Water initially raised combined water and sewer rates in 2024 by 13% on average. The most recent proposal would raise rates by another 12% on average, the utility says, or about $9 a month.

Last year, all city council members abstained from voting on the rate hike, the Clarion Ledger reported. But on April 22, the council voted 6-0 in opposition of the latest increase, arguing that JXN Water should improve collection rates before asking for more from those already paying.
“We felt (last year) it wouldn’t make any difference because it had to go before the judge,” Council President Virgi Lindsay said during the April meeting. “But this time I feel like it is important that I be a part of sending a message to this judge that this is excessive and it’s too much, and it’s more than our citizens should be asked to bear.
“We have got to put some of the onus back on JXN Water.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/29110437/IMG_5672.jpg,,,2025-05-29 13:13:21.024448

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge said Wednesday that attempts to deport a pro-Palestinian Columbia University activist likely violate the Constitution, dealing a potential blow to efforts by the Trump administration to kick political student activists out of the country.
But U.S. Judge Michael Farbiarz stopped short of releasing Mahmoud Khalil, a legal resident of the U.S., from the Louisiana jail where he is being held. Farbiarz directed Khalil’s legal team to present more arguments on why he should be released.
The judge added that while Khalil may be successful in challenging the government’s “vagueness” regarding his detention, the government may still be justified in detaining him based on their allegation that he lied on his green card application. Khalil contends he is a political prisoner detained in violation of his free speech rights.
“If an immigration court holds that the Petitioner did not have to disclose the allegedly omitted information, that could fully dispose of the underlying ground for removal, without any need for a federal court to reach a potentially complex First Amendment question,” Farbiarz wrote in the 106-page decision.
Khalil was arrested by federal immigration agents in New York City on March 8 and has been held in immigration detention in Louisiana since. He was among the first in a wave of pro-Palestinian legal residents who have been arrested by federal authorities as the Trump administration has ramped up mass deportation and tested the limits of immigration law.
While Khalil hasn’t been charged with a crime, he’s facing removal based on two claims: inaccuracies on his green card application and a determination by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Khail’s presence in the country would have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences” and “compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.”
Khalil’s legal challenge to his detention is playing out in two courts — immigration court in Louisiana, where a judge said she had no authority to question the government’s decision to remove Khalil, and in federal court in New Jersey, where Khalil was temporarily held while his attorneys filed a petition for his release.
Farbiarz’s ruling says Rubio likely overstepped his authority when he invoked a rarely used provision of federal law called section 1227 to target Khalil and other student activists for deportation. The statute allows for the deportation of non-citizens if the secretary of state determines their “presence or activities … would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”
“The petitioner is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim that section 1227 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him through the SoS’s determination,” Farbiarz wrote.
Removal of this kind, he added, would be “unprecedented.”
The judge asked for additional briefings on the government’s claims surrounding Kahlil’s green card application. He also said he would soon issue another order with the next steps in the case.
The American Civil Liberties Union, part of the legal team representing Khalil, said in a statement they vow to keep fighting for his release.
“We will work as quickly as possible to provide the court the additional information it requested supporting our effort to free Mahmoud or otherwise return him to his wife and newborn son.  Every day Mahmoud spends languishing in an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, is an affront to justice, and we won’t stop working until he is free,” his legal team said.
Khalil is protected from being deported immediately under a previous order from Farbiarz that bars the government from removing him while his fight to be released from detention proceeds.

Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.

The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.

‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”

Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

,DC,2025-05-29 17:10:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"U.S. House-passed tax bill weakens accountability at for-profit colleges, advocates say",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passed-tax-bill-weakens-accountability-profit-colleges-advocates-say,,"WASHINGTON — The massive tax and spending package U.S. House Republicans narrowly advanced last week could hinder accountability for for-profit colleges and weaken student-borrower protections, student advocates say.The bill, now headed to the Senate, calls for sweeping changes to education policy under what GOP lawmakers deem “regulatory relief.” That includes eliminating a rule governing for-profit schools, removing “gainful employment” as a goal for colleges receiving federal funds and hindering consumer protections for borrowers defrauded or facing school closures.GOP lawmakers are aiming to slash billions of dollars in federal spending to offset the cost of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, border security and defense spending through the complex budget reconciliation process, which allows Congress to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship. The package, which the House passed 215-214 last week, will likely undergo significant changes in the Senate.The House Committee on Education and Workforce’s portion of the reconciliation package also includes significant changes to how student loans are repaid, cuts to federal student aid and new eligibility requirements for the Pell Grant, a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college.Student advocates and congressional Democrats have opposed the bill, emphasizing the impact of the proposed changes on higher education affordability and access as well as the weakening of protections for defrauded borrowers and fewer guardrails to hold for-profit schools accountable. Kyle Southern, associate vice president for higher education quality at the Institute for College Access & Success, said the bill would “put higher education further out of reach for low-income students, students of color (and) many first-generation students.”“It would also make it a riskier investment, because it ... weakens or rolls back many critical student protections that have been put in place as guardrails to help ensure the quality of post-secondary programs across sectors,” he said.The nonprofit advocacy group aims to advance affordability, accountability and equity in higher education.Here’s a closer look at the bill’s key education provisions related to institutional accountability and borrower protections:Repealing the 90/10 ruleThe bill repeals the Education Department’s “90/10 rule,” which requires that at least 10% of the money for-profit institutions receive derives from non-federal sources.The regulation initially did not apply to student veteran benefits, creating a loophole that pushed for-profit schools to target veterans in their programs.Though Congress did eventually close the loophole in a provision of the massive COVID-19 relief package Congress passed in 2021, the current bill would slash the rule altogether.Carrie Wofford, president of Veterans Education Success, said the 90/10 rule “stops federal funds from being used to prop up otherwise failing college companies.”Wofford said “it’s very shocking and upsetting to all the veterans and military leaders who worked for a decade to get this done and had a bipartisan agreement and had Republican leadership completely signing off,” referencing the efforts to close the earlier loophole.Veterans Education Success, a group which advocates for the rights of student veterans, service members and their families, wrote to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions last week urging the panel to not include the repeal of the 90/10 rule in the chamber’s version of the bill.Gainful employmentThe bill would also strike the phrase “gainful employment” from several definitions within the Higher Education Act, a law providing financial assistance for students and higher education institutions.As the Institute for College Access & Success notes in a fact sheet, the Gainful Employment rule, an Education Department regulation, helps “ensure that career education programs receiving federal student aid prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation” and aims to “protect students from low-value programs that leave graduates with unaffordable debt and poor job prospects.”Striking the term from the definitions likely sets the stage for the Education Department to rescind the rule, according to Sarah Austin, a policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.“Presumably, what we kind of took (striking the phrase) to mean is that that would lead to them rescinding gainful employment rules because the definitions in statute were what they’ve always kind of used as showing their legal authority to regulate on gainful employment,” Austin said.“Without those definitions in there, not only does that seem to say that they would not have these gainful employment regulations, but also would kind of stop future administrations from having any sort of gainful employment framework because the definitions are not even in the Higher Education Act anymore.”Borrower protectionsAs for borrower protections, the bill would also repeal 2022 versions of the Closed School Discharge and Borrower Defense to Repayment rules, reverting to what they looked like before the Biden administration.While the Closed School Discharge rule provides debt relief to a borrower whose school shuts down, the Borrower Defense to Repayment provision helps forgive debt for students whose institution defrauded them.Austin said that “with the 2022 rules, there was automatic post-school discharge, so if a school closed, a borrower may be entitled to have their loans automatically discharged, not require any action on their behalf, where the prior set of rules, they would actually have to apply for the closed school discharge, so this would be reverting back to that if it was to move forward as law.”Under the bill, the Borrower Defense to Repayment provision would fall back to a 2019 rule that then-Education Secretary Betsy DeVos put into place.Southern, of the Institute for College Access & Success, said that 2019 rule “made the process essentially so onerous and arbitrary that qualifying people would not be able to receive the relief that federal law entitles them to.”",,,,2025-05-29 13:13:21.024448

(Courtesy of Jim Pillen for Governor)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a day after passage of a bill he supported limiting participation in women’s sports to a student athlete’s sex at birth, kicked off his second campaign for governor with a red-meat appeal to his Republican base.
The first-term governor’s campaign video emphasized his role in signing “the largest income tax cut in Nebraska history” and says he “reduced property taxes,” done mainly by having the state absorb more of the costs of community colleges from property taxpayers.
Pillen touted his rural roots as Nebraska’s first active farmer as governor in at least a century. His family runs a massive hog operation based in Columbus, Pillen Family Farms. He is also a veterinarian and former University of Nebraska regent.
He also vocally backs law enforcement, including pay raises for the Nebraska State Patrol. He plans to run again with Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, a former top prosecutor in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and Lancaster County. 
Familiar themes
The kickoff video jumped back into controversies from his 2022 campaign for governor, including tough talk about illegal immigration and his willingness to keep spending state tax dollars deploying the Nebraska National Guard to the Texas-Mexico border.

Some opponents have argued he says one thing and does another by attacking immigrants while running a major agricultural operation, many of which rely heavily on immigrant labor, including some who are not in the country legally.
Pillen also highlighted culture war changes he supported, including his push to “keep men out of girls’ sports,” limiting gender-affirming care for minors and federal efforts to ban diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in schools, colleges and universities.
“Here in Nebraska, it’s what you do, not how you look, that still determines how far you go,” he said in the announcement. “If you learn anything growing up on the farm, there’s always more work to do.”
The message and its timing, as the Legislature closes Pillen’s third regular session in charge, appear aimed at asserting himself to a GOP audience of two: President Donald Trump and Trump donor Charles Herbster, Pillen’s top GOP primary election opponent from 2022. 
Herbster, a multi-state businessman with southeast Nebraska ties, has announced no timeline for deciding on a bid. His spokesman, Rod Edwards, said Thursday that Herbster has been “hearing from a lot of Nebraskans wanting him to run.”
Watching the White House
Pillen’s campaign had no immediate comment beyond a statement issued alongside the announcement. In it, the governor said he “proudly advanced President Trump’s agenda.” Pillen has made more first-term White House trips than recent predecessors.

Some of that appears aimed at keeping Trump on the sidelines in a potential GOP primary rematch with Herbster, whom Trump endorsed in 2022 against Pillen. 
Pillen had the backing of departing Gov. Pete Ricketts, whom Pillen appointed to the U.S. Senate one week after becoming governor and won a special election in November to serve out the final two years of former GOP U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term.
Several Republican operatives expect Pillen to draw one or more primary challengers, if not more. Among the criticisms he is likely to face are those about increased spending, the effectiveness of state investments in property tax relief and some of his budget decisions, including recent troubles turning in line-item vetoes to the right office at the right time.
Nebraska Democrats have also been recruiting a potential challenger for Pillen but have not announced one yet. Some Democratic political observers have speculated that a state senator might run against him or Herbster.
Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said the state deserves a leader who “prioritizes our economic livelihoods, not Donald Trump’s culture wars.”
“Governor Pillen will have to answer for why he is choosing slum lords and bed bugs over Nebraskans,” Kleeb said. “Or why he has failed to lower property taxes. Or why he chooses to attack vulnerable kids and our public schools.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The rank awfulness of the recent “we’re just looking for cars with tail lights out so we can help drivers realize they need to make some safety repairs” immigrant roundup in South Nashville needs little amplification from me given the blast of righteous contempt blowing around much of the city. But moving beyond indignation, it’s worth pondering broader dimensions of the moral insult here. Why is this happening in the way that it’s happening, and what should be done by those who are outraged?
First, though, some professional grade outrage, so here’s the American Civil Liberties Union: “A deportation system that herds 75 percent of people through fast-track, streamlined removal is a system devoid of fairness and individualized due process. Nonjudicial removals violate our constitutional tradition.” They go on to say that the administration has “prioritized speed over fairness in the removal system.” (Disclosure: I sit on the board of ACLU’s Tennessee affiliate but do not speak for them.)
I suspect many who are appalled at traffic-stop detentions and the climate of fear they create would say that “speed over fairness” sums it up pretty well. But here’s the thing: that ACLU quote is from 2014, and the administration in question was Barack Obama’s. And indeed, Obama’s record on immigration — the “deporter in chief” by some accounts — did feature removals of noncitizens far outpacing the Clinton and Bush administrations that came before.
I mention this not to frame some sort of moral equivalence between President Donald Trump and Obama, but to highlight a chronic policy equivalence that has afflicted not just those two but every administration since Clinton’s. 
The culprit of course is Washington’s inexhaustible futility on immigration. The last comprehensive bill signed into law by Ronald Reagan in 1986 gave rise to legal status for a few million of the undocumented. Ensuing decades brought tweaks in federal law on admissions, enforcement and border control, but also growth in the unauthorized immigrant population to its current eight-figure level. Meanwhile, occasional stabs at meaningful reform of a system that pretty much everyone agrees needs an overhaul have repeatedly failed. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

That’s left each administration over the last four decades with basically three options: (1) try to light a fire under major immigration reform in Congress, or (2) do essentially nothing and let legal and nonlegal immigrant demography go where it will on its own, or (3) use instruments of state power to try to rein in that demography in the short run and kick the actual reform can down the road. And while (1) gets its share of lip service, each administration since Reagan has ultimately opted for a blend of (2) and (3): throw some people out, hope some others leave , don’t talk about it much and focus on other things.
This informal working consensus that we’ll just muddle through until major reform magically happens has sufficed because immigration and the border have not been big issues driving voters. Attitudes toward immigration have trended in a positive direction over the decades, in 2016 even most Trump supporters thought many undocumented immigrants should be allowed to remain, and in 2020 Immigration continued to rank relatively low among issues important to voters. But then in 2024 Trump parlayed border mayhem and isolated migrant violence (with an assist from Bidenworld’s policy fecklessness) into a hefty surge in voter interest and alarm. 
So Trump runs on “mass deportation,” wins, takes office and starts detaining and deporting. With roots in due process nonchalance and public information minimalism, his administration’s methods run the gamut from crude to cruel: pseudorandom traffic stops as we’ve seen here in Nashville, workplace raids and the particularly vile tactic of nabbing people when they show up for required appointments at immigration courts. Not to be that glib schmuck who rationalizes — “he’s doing what voters elected him to do” — but he is doing what he said he’d do. 
Strident moral outrage is an appropriate reflex, but it’s not as widely shared as some may wish. A recent Pew survey finds an overall majority of U.S. adults think Trump is not overstepping when it comes to deporting immigrants. 










A message to Democrats and liberals grousing loudly and justifiably about the President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement is you can’t stop there; you need to say concretely what you would do differently. 


Especially relevant to doings in Nashville are the majority who are fine with law enforcement asking for immigration status during routine encounters and making immigration arrests in homes,workplaces and at public gatherings. It feels as though the public mind on this projects a kind of passive tolerance for something distasteful (like eating a rutabaga)— a sense of being generally “not not okay” with it. 
Let’s keep in mind also that most of what’s happening is legally kosher. Sure, there’s the occasional need for a court to throw in with a due-process face slap. On the whole, though, ICE and its lackeys (like our servile Tennessee Highway Patrol) may be using tactics that prior administrations wouldn’t use, but these aren’t tactics that prior administrations couldn’t use. 
My theory is that many who tolerate Trump’s brackish regime of detention and deportation do so not through blindness to its calamitous effects on families and communities, but through exasperation with the government’s inability to get anything done. However repellant the methods, and however botched the surgery, this is a twisted but measurable version of getting something done. 
My message to Democrats and liberals grousing loudly and justifiably about the hideousness of Trumpian immigration enforcement is you can’t stop there; we need to hear what concretely you would do differently. 
The voting public has made it clear that the Obama-Biden approach — timid enforcement aimed at preserving the status quo and kicking the can down the road — is no longer viable. And political realities strongly suggest that Reagan-style amnesty is not on the table. So how would you affirmatively alter the landscape of unauthorized immigration? How fast and with what methods? 
Morally principled agita on this issue may be a constructive outlet for conscience and community, but it’s not by itself enough to carve a path back to power.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge said Wednesday that attempts to deport a pro-Palestinian Columbia University activist likely violate the Constitution, dealing a potential blow to efforts by the Trump administration to kick political student activists out of the country.
But U.S. Judge Michael Farbiarz stopped short of releasing Mahmoud Khalil, a legal resident of the U.S., from the Louisiana jail where he is being held. Farbiarz directed Khalil’s legal team to present more arguments on why he should be released.
The judge added that while Khalil may be successful in challenging the government’s “vagueness” regarding his detention, the government may still be justified in detaining him based on their allegation that he lied on his green card application. Khalil contends he is a political prisoner detained in violation of his free speech rights.
“If an immigration court holds that the Petitioner did not have to disclose the allegedly omitted information, that could fully dispose of the underlying ground for removal, without any need for a federal court to reach a potentially complex First Amendment question,” Farbiarz wrote in the 106-page decision.
Khalil was arrested by federal immigration agents in New York City on March 8 and has been held in immigration detention in Louisiana since. He was among the first in a wave of pro-Palestinian legal residents who have been arrested by federal authorities as the Trump administration has ramped up mass deportation and tested the limits of immigration law.
While Khalil hasn’t been charged with a crime, he’s facing removal based on two claims: inaccuracies on his green card application and a determination by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Khail’s presence in the country would have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences” and “compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.”
Khalil’s legal challenge to his detention is playing out in two courts — immigration court in Louisiana, where a judge said she had no authority to question the government’s decision to remove Khalil, and in federal court in New Jersey, where Khalil was temporarily held while his attorneys filed a petition for his release.
Farbiarz’s ruling says Rubio likely overstepped his authority when he invoked a rarely used provision of federal law called section 1227 to target Khalil and other student activists for deportation. The statute allows for the deportation of non-citizens if the secretary of state determines their “presence or activities … would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”
“The petitioner is likely to succeed on the merits of his claim that section 1227 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him through the SoS’s determination,” Farbiarz wrote.
Removal of this kind, he added, would be “unprecedented.”
The judge asked for additional briefings on the government’s claims surrounding Kahlil’s green card application. He also said he would soon issue another order with the next steps in the case.
The American Civil Liberties Union, part of the legal team representing Khalil, said in a statement they vow to keep fighting for his release.
“We will work as quickly as possible to provide the court the additional information it requested supporting our effort to free Mahmoud or otherwise return him to his wife and newborn son.  Every day Mahmoud spends languishing in an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, is an affront to justice, and we won’t stop working until he is free,” his legal team said.
Khalil is protected from being deported immediately under a previous order from Farbiarz that bars the government from removing him while his fight to be released from detention proceeds.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge said Wednesday that attempts to deport a pro-Palestinian Columbia University activist likely violate the Constitution, dealing a potential blow to efforts by the Trump administration to kick political student activists out of the country.  
But U.S. Judge Michael Farbiarz stopped short of releasing Mahmoud Khalil, a legal resident of the U.S., from the Louisiana jail where he is being held. Farbiarz directed Khalil’s legal team to present more arguments on why he should be released. 
The judge added that while Khalil may be successful in challenging the government’s “vagueness” regarding his detention, the government may still be justified in detaining him based on their allegation that he lied on his green card application. Khalil contends he is a political prisoner detained in violation of his free speech rights.
“If an immigration court holds that the Petitioner did not have to disclose the allegedly omitted information, that could fully dispose of the underlying ground for removal, without any need for a federal court to reach a potentially complex First Amendment question,” Farbiarz wrote in the 106-page decision. 
Khalil was arrested by federal immigration agents in New York City on March 8 and has been held in immigration detention in Louisiana since. He was among the first in a wave of pro-Palestinian legal residents who have been arrested by federal authorities as the Trump administration has ramped up mass deportation and tested the limits of immigration law. 
While Khalil hasn’t been charged with a crime, he’s facing removal based on two claims: inaccuracies on his green card application and a determination by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Khail’s presence in the country would have “serious adverse foreign policy consequences” and “compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.”
Khalil’s legal challenge to his detention is playing out in two courts — immigration court in Louisiana, where a judge said she had no authority to question the government’s decision to remove Khalil, and in federal court in New Jersey, where Khalil was temporarily held while his attorneys filed a petition for his release.
Farbiarz’s ruling says Rubio likely overstepped his authority when he invoked a rarely used provision of federal law called section 1227 to target Khalil and other student activists for deportation. The statute allows for the deportation of non-citizens if the secretary of state determines their “presence or activities … would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences.”

(AFGE webstream)Brendan Demich was on a bus to Washington, D.C., last week to attend a rally outside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ office.
At the same time, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was assuring lawmakers that critical programs in his department, specifically those protecting coal miners, would continue despite drastic cuts to his agency’s staff and budget.
It was the third in a series of contentious hearings for Kennedy. And for Demich, a Pennsylvania employee of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a research agency in Kennedy’s department, they were hard to stomach.
He’s part of a roughly 100-person team at NIOSH’s Bruceton facility in Allegheny County that studies the best ways to prevent injuries, illnesses, and death in coal mines. Last month, he and all of his colleagues were notified that their jobs would be eliminated in June. Another team in Spokane, Washington, focused on safety in non-coal mines received similar notices.
Combined, they conduct the bulk of the agency’s mine safety research.
“[Kennedy]’s claiming that he hasn’t fired any scientists, and that the only people that they’re cutting are doing duplicative work, but that is absolutely not the case,” Demich told the Capital-Star. “Our titles may be engineers, but we do science … And there’s no other agency that does the work we do here at NIOSH.”
The picture Demich paints is different from Kennedy’s.
“The work at NIOSH will not be interrupted,” Kennedy responded to a question from a lawmaker about layoffs. “The work on mine safety will continue. We understand it’s critically important to function and we don’t want to see it end.”
The hearings took place over the last three weeks after reports emerged that critical and legally required programs to help miners with black lung disease were no longer functioning, after an estimated 90% of NIOSH’s roughly 1400 full-time staff were laid off, offered early retirement or placed on administrative leave pending termination in early April.
Miners developing black lung, an irreversible and degenerative disease, were suddenly not able to get approved for a program facilitating transfers to less dusty mines. Black lung screenings that can help miners with the disease receive federal benefits were also stopped.
This led to a class action lawsuit and pressure from Republican lawmakers to reverse the layoffs of federal workers whose jobs were ensuring mine safety.
So, earlier this month, Kennedy brought back over 300 NIOSH employees, including the Morgantown team that studies black lungs and ensures benefits for programs for miners who develop it continue to function.
Kennedy also restored a team focused on the health of 9/11 first responders, as well as a team that works on the same Pittsburgh campus as Demich’s that tests and certifies respirators used by miners, firefighters and other professionals.
But Demich’s division is still expecting to be laid off.
Earlier this month, at a meeting, Demich said Pittsburgh employees in the mine safety division were told they no longer had to come into work, though a handful still do.
There had been hope with the Trump administration’s rhetoric around increasing coal mining and U.S. Health Department’s statements on the importance of miner safety that the job cuts would be reversed. But when NIOSH staff in other departments were brought back, Demich said, ”it crushed morale in the mining division. A lot of people see it as writing on the wall that we’re not being saved.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions from the Capital-Star about future plans for the mine research divisions. But a spokesperson provided a statement saying, “Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
Demich finds HHS statements on preserving critical programs frustrating, given the cuts on his and similar teams.
“I don’t know how you can say that you’re maintaining essential services for coal workers and miners when you’re cutting the divisions that mainly do the research and provide the services to prevent mine injuries, illnesses and fatalities,” he said. “Our work does not overlap at all with the [Morgantown] division, other than that we both want to prevent black lung.”
‘Those functions are going to disappear’
There is virtually no operational mine in the United States that hasn’t implemented safety measures based on research conducted by NIOSH.
The U.S. government got into mine safety research when the Bureau of Mines was established in 1910, after a series of deadly explosions killed hundreds of miners in just a few short years. The bureau was tasked with researching safer practices, inspecting mines and collecting data on the industry.
The work was successful. For decades, miner fatality rates steadily and precipitously decreased. That continued after the Bureau of Mines was shuttered and effectively rolled into the Department of Health and Human Services in the 1990s, where it now sits.
NIOSH’s mine safety divisions don’t set or enforce rules, but research it conducts has led to breakthroughs in technology that detects coal dust levels in real time, prevents mine roofs from collapsing, increases mineshaft ventilation and provides barriers between miners and powerful explosions.
“Those functions are going to disappear and I’m not quite sure who else would be able to do those,” said Tony Iannacchione, a former employee of NIOSH’s coal mine safety team who now teaches at the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering. “There’s some pretty unique expertise. And if you don’t have a government agency that’s keeping its thumb on the pulse and coming up with modifications and improvements to the systems being used in mines, we’re gonna be in a bad way.”
Iannacchione says that work is only getting more important. The more coal that’s extracted, the deeper miners have to dig to find it. That makes for more dangerous mines and requires new research and safety protocols.
“As you go deeper, you get higher concentrations of methane gas and all these problems just get worse,” he said. “For the industry to react to all these problems, it’s really beyond their capability. You need the government involved.”
Iannacchione cited recent NIOSH research that set new industry standards for blast walls that are placed between miners and explosives, as well as new methods for placing roof supports. The Pittsburgh team has also done extensive work on preventing hearing loss, which is an issue in underground mines that are full of loud machinery.
The coal mine safety team in Pittsburgh is also developing technology that can read silica dust levels in real time, but that has yet to be deployed. As miners dig into tougher terrain, they’re exposed to much more silica dust, which has led to an increase in the development of silicosis and black lung among younger miners and develops at an accelerated rate. Widespread use of real time monitors, Iannacchione said, could save lives. But it’s unclear if the work will be finished by the time the layoffs fully take effect in June.
Demich, the chief steward of the union representing Pittsburgh-area NIOSH workers, said he was working on a virtual reality training program for first responders and rescue teams to simulate mine disasters. They had begun training teams around the country, but the cuts effectively ended that work. He believes, with a little more time, they could have brought it to almost every mine rescue team in the U.S.
‘Benefit of the doubt’ 
Sam Petsonk has been an advocate for coal miners for his entire career. The West Virginia-based lawyer led the recent lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services that resulted in an injunction ruling last week, effectively requiring the return of NIOSH workers running Black Lung programs in Morgantown.
He successfully argued that the department was breaking the law by effectively shuttering congressionally-approved programs for miners with black lung by laying off the staff that implemented them. But, as he sees it, the law also requires the kind of research done by NIOSH’s teams that are still facing layoffs.
“These Pittsburgh programs are every bit as mandatory under the Mine Act,” Petsonk told the Capital-Star. “I would like to give Secretary Kennedy a bit of the benefit of the doubt here that he’s still digesting his obligations here.”
But the mandate is far less clear, with statute generally requiring NIOSH to conduct “research, demonstrations, and experiments” to support the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, which sets and enforces rules for mine companies to follow.
The injunction ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger focused on the availability of black lung programs, but also said “the Court orders that there be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and the attendant regulations for the health and safety of miners.”
Asked if he would bring a lawsuit if the mine safety research teams are not brought back, Petsonk said he wants to wait until the end of the 20-day period that Berger allowed to comply with the injunction. That will be on June 2.
“If they look at it, they will see the need to revive the mining research labs within NIOSH,” Petsonk said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about whether it believes the injunction applies to the research teams, or whether law requires them to be operational.
“They should just follow the law and re-open the research labs in Pittsburgh and Spokane because miners need it,” Petsonk said.
While it’s unclear if a legal remedy would be available to advocates like Petsonk who want mine safety research at NIOSH to continue, Demich is trying another way. When he was in Washington, D.C. last week, he and his NIOSH colleagues met with the staff of an estimated 15 to 20 lawmakers in an attempt to inform them about the research being lost and ask them to restore their jobs and research funding.
As it stands, even though Demich and his coworkers in Allegheny County are still technically employed, strict limits on research spending and travel would prevent them from doing a lot of their previous work.
Demich would not say which lawmakers’ staff he and his colleagues met with, since discussions are still ongoing. But he said the initial conversations were promising. He personally met with staff from lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. He did note they were two Democrats and two Republicans.
“There’s a lot of questions about coal mines and about all the work we’re doing here in Pittsburgh,” Demich said. “A lot of people want  to follow-up and I think we’ll be reaching out.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a controversial railway that would connect Colorado to Utah’s oil-rich Uinta Basin, allowing the state to ramp up oil exports.
The unanimous decision released Thursday clears a major hurdle for the proposed Uinta Basin Railway, which has been held up in the courts for several years after Colorado’s Eagle County and five environmental groups sued in 2022.
In 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals’ D.C. Circuit sided with Eagle County and the environmental groups, ruling that the railway’s initial environmental review was incomplete and failed to consider certain risks, like threats to wildfire or possible water pollution.
Thursday’s ruling overturns that decision, returning the case to a lower court for consideration. While it’s a win for the railway, the project still faces other regulatory roadblocks before construction can begin.

The Uinta Basin Railway would transport waxy crude oil — a type of oil that, as its name suggests, is viscous like shoe polish — from the Uinta Basin to national rail lines in Utah, where it would then be exported through Colorado and eventually to refineries on the Gulf Coast.


Read Colorado Newsline’s series Down the Line, about the proposed Uinta Basin Railway project and its potential impact in Colorado.


The 88-mile railway extension could transport an estimated 350,000 barrels each day, massively increasing the state’s oil production — the refineries in Salt Lake City, for instance, currently have a market capacity of 85,000 barrels per day.
Proponents of the project say the railway will help Utah’s economic growth and bring jobs to the Uinta Basin.
But in their lawsuit, environmental groups and Eagle County argued that the federal Surface Transportation Board — the agency tasked with the environmental review — fell short in its analysis in 2021, failing to consider the risks of the railroad expansion.
That includes the upstream risks, like the environmental impact of more oil production in the Uinta Basin; the downstream risks, including potential harms caused by increased oil production on the Gulf Coast; and the downline risks of exporting more oil along the rail line, which the lawsuit claimed could harm wildlife, increase risk of wildfire, and lead to more pollution.
The appeals court ultimately sided with that argument, nullifying parts of the original environmental impact statement and instructing the board to conduct a more detailed analysis of the risks.
In his opinion issued Thursday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh rejected that decision, writing that the board’s review of the project only needs to focus on the railway’s immediate impacts — not the ripple of environmental concerns flagged in the lawsuit.
“The Board did not need to evaluate potential environmental impacts of the separate upstream and downstream projects,” Kavanaugh wrote. “The environmental consequences of future oil drilling in the Basin are distinct from construction and operation of the railroad line.”
Phil Weiser, Colorado’s attorney general, who filed a brief with the court in support of Eagle County, decried the decision, describing the railway as “a risky scheme to transport waxy crude oil along the Colorado River, right alongside our most critical water resource and posing major risks to Colorado’s Western Slope communities.”
“The proposed project — now allowed by the court’s ruling — lets an out-of-state company build a new 88-mile railway to ship thousands of oil barrels along the river daily,” Weiser said in a statement. “We’ll remain vigilant and deploy every tool available under the law to protect Colorado’s land, air, and water and hold federal agencies accountable to their oversight obligations.”
Justice Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the consideration of the case.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-29 16:30:53+00:00,CT Mirror,U.S. Dept. of Education launches Title IX probe of Cromwell Public Schools,Jessika Harkay,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/cromwell-public-schools-dept-of-ed-title-ix-trump/,Trump administration is probing policies allowing transgender students to play sports and use facilities aligned with their gender identity.,"The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into Cromwell Public Schools for possible violations to federal sex-based discrimination laws.
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a May 2 letter to Cromwell Superintendent Enza Macri that federal officials “will examine” whether the district is violating Title IX statutes by allowing transgender students to participate in sports and use facilities that align with their gender identity.
Cromwell came under investigation by the same office in 2019, during President Donald J. Trump’s first administration, after a transgender student athlete, Andraya Yearwood, competed as a member of the town’s high school track team and reached the state finals. Three female athletes also sued the state and several school districts — including Cromwell — to block transgender students from playing girls’ sports. 
In 2020, federal officials reached a determination that Connecticut had violated Title IX, but state leaders pushed back. Then in early 2021, just a few weeks into his term, President Joe Biden’s administration withdrew support for the lawsuit and rescinded the Education Department’s threats to cut funding to the districts. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2022. 
This time around, the Office of Civil Rights is employing a “Rapid Resolution Process,” which would expedite the investigation, according to the letter. 
Trainor wrote that the investigation is “not itself evidence of a violation of federal civil rights laws and regulations,” but he cited Cromwell Board of Education policies that grant access to restrooms, locker rooms, physical education classes, intramural sports and interscholastic competitive sports teams “in a manner consistent with their gender identity,” as evidence for the investigation.
“This policy is in irresolvable conflict with Federal law,” Trainor wrote. “Given Cromwell Public Schools’ publicly posted position in opposition to Title IX compliance, girls and young women will be, and are being, irreparably harmed on a continuous basis.”
The state Department of Education was informed by Cromwell district leaders about the investigation on May 22, about three weeks after the letter was issued. A spokesperson from the department said they were reviewing 2024 Title IX guidance, but provided no further details. 
If Cromwell is again found out of compliance with Title IX, its federal funding could be at risk. The district received over $1.26 million from the federal government in the 2023-24 school year, according to School and State Finance Project. It’s total annual education budget is roughly $40 million, which is mostly covered by the town. 
Cromwell, a town of just over 14,000, sits along the west side of the Connecticut River roughly 15 miles south of Hartford. In the 2024 presidential election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won 54% of Cromwell’s 8,578 votes and President Donald J. Trump won 44%. 
Cromwell Mayor James Demetriades, a Democrat, did not respond to requests for comment. Superintendent Enza Macri deferred comment to a local school board attorney, who also did not respond for comment Tuesday. 
State Rep. Christie Carpino, R-Cromwell, said she only became aware of the investigation letter Tuesday when asked for comment by the Connecticut Mirror.
“I immediately contacted our superintendent of schools that received notification from federal authorities dated May 2. As a parent of a student athletes in our school system, and an elected representative of all my constituents in my communities, I take any investigation into potential violations of Title IX regulations extremely seriously,” she said in a written statement.
Carpino didn’t offer an opinion on whether students participating in sports that align with their gender identity violates Title IX. She also did not directly address whether she supported the investigation. “Any and all allegations of potential civil rights violations of students should be vigorously pursued,” Carpino wrote in response to questions.
The latest investigation follows several executive orders from President Donald J. Trump that have reshaped the federal Department of Education — particularly with respect to Title IX guidance and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination, was extended under former President Joe Biden to students who identify as LGBTQ+ and added protections for transgender students.
Connecticut reaffirmed those Title IX protections last year and said schools must treat all students equitably, regardless of their gender identity, in academic and extracurricular settings, even as a handful of other states sued the Biden administration for its Title IX expansion that extended protections to LGBTQ+ students.
After Trump took office in January, he reverted Title IX protections back to the 2020 guidance that was issued during his first administration. Under the new rules, the federal Education Department will enforce Title IX “on the basis of biological sex in schools and on campuses.”
Trump has also signed executive orders this year banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth under the age of 19, prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military, mandating the recognition of only two genders and calling for a pullback of federal funding for “illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.”
In April, the federal department issued letters that called for an end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in K-12 schools and requested that state officials “certify their compliance with their anti-discrimination obligations in order to continue receiving federal financial assistance.”
Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker announced weeks later that the state responded to the request and would not sign it. Russell-Tucker wrote to the federal Education Department that Connecticut and state officials are already in compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws.
The Maine Department of Education was found noncompliant with Title IX protections in March after the state stood by its LGBTQ+ protections, including allowing transgender athletes to participate in sports.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)The first round of water sample tests following Tuesday’s boil water advisory in Richmond has come back clean, city officials announced late Wednesday evening — a promising sign amid the second major water crisis to hit the city in less than six months.
“I’m encouraged that the first round of water sample results has come back with a negative result,” Mayor Danny Avula said in a statement. “Some parts of Richmond are still under a boil water advisory as we await the second sample test, but this is very promising. We’re hopeful for full clearance soon and are so grateful for everyone’s patience and care.”
The first set of samples was taken around 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, shortly after the city, in coordination with the Virginia Department of Health, issued a boil water advisory for large portions of the city due to a sudden drop in water pressure. 
Those test results, which came back at approximately 9:15 p.m. Wednesday, passed compliance standards and have been shared with the health department. A second round of samples was collected Wednesday around 11:40 a.m., with results expected by early Thursday afternoon. The advisory will remain in place until both rounds test negative, per state protocols.
The affected areas include neighborhoods served by the Ginter Park Tank, such as the Fan, Byrd Park, Carytown, Brookland Park, Jackson Ward, Carver, Oregon Hill, Randolph, and VCU’s Monroe Park campus. Later Tuesday, the advisory was extended to cover Southside communities including Bellemeade, Blackwell, Manchester, and Hillside Court, among others.
Residents are being urged not to drink unboiled tap water or use it for cooking, brushing teeth, making ice, or washing food. While some customers have experienced a complete loss of water service or low pressure, others may not have noticed changes — but are still advised to boil water before use and conserve as much as possible.
“This advisory comes after the city’s water treatment plant experienced an operational issue in the early morning hours on Tuesday, May 27, and after the water system had been restored to full production,” the city said in a statement. “The filters re-clogged after running at full production for over an hour.”
Internal records obtained by WTVR suggest delayed maintenance at the city’s water treatment plant may have contributed to the issue. 
A May 12 work order flagged clogged plate settlers — filters that help remove sediment — for cleaning. But follow-up notes show the job was postponed two days later when operations staff reportedly said “this was not a good time.” 
“These plates are critical,” engineer Joe Paulsen told the TV news station. “If they’re not cleaned, sediment overwhelms the system and clogs the filters.”
City officials have confirmed high turbidity was to blame for this week’s filter failure but have not addressed whether the maintenance delay was a factor. Interim utilities director Scott Morris told city council Wednesday that a full root cause analysis will take several weeks and that new maintenance protocols are in development. 
This week’s boil advisory follows a cascading system-wide failure in January that left large parts of Richmond and surrounding counties without reliable drinking water for several days. That event prompted a damning investigation by the Virginia Department of Health, which found the incident “completely avoidable” and cited “a long chain of preventable failures.”
In response to this week’s pressure drop, the city quickly resumed coordination with state health officials and ramped up emergency responses. This time, unlike in January, the city began delivering bottled water to nine high-priority populations — including hospitals, senior homes, public housing complexes, and childcare providers — distributing roughly 140,000 bottles since Tuesday.
“People can use the water,” Avula said during a virtual briefing Tuesday. “They just need to boil it before they drink it.”
Still, the incident is likely to draw renewed scrutiny to Richmond’s aging infrastructure and emergency preparedness. A 314-page report released in April identified more than $63 million in needed upgrades on top of $60 million already allocated in the city’s capital improvement plan. Among the recommendations: modernized electrical systems, automated emergency protocols, and a complete redesign of the clearwell overflow system.
That overhaul is now under a state-mandated corrective action plan following a second formal notice of violation tied to the January breakdown.
In the current situation, the city said it reached out early Tuesday morning to water customers in Chesterfield and Henrico counties to reduce pressure on the shared system. Avula noted that public alerts were issued later in the day because the city first had to assess the scope of the issue and coordinate a response.
Morris, the city’s interim Department of Public Utilities director, added that the coordination with surrounding counties “allowed us to have more time to recover the facility and then make a plan of action to move forward.”
Still, some residents expressed confusion as city messaging shifted throughout the day. An initial 9 a.m. statement downplayed the impact on drinking water, only for a full boil advisory to be issued a few hours later.
The full safety clearance hinges on Thursday’s test results. Until then, city officials are urging continued caution and patience. Updated information and interactive maps of affected neighborhoods are available at rva.gov, and residents are encouraged to follow city social media channels for timely updates.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)Richmond’s boil water advisory has officially been lifted after two consecutive rounds of water tests came back clean, city officials announced Thursday afternoon, ending a three-day disruption that once again exposed vulnerabilities in the city’s aging water system.
At 2:30 p.m., Mayor Danny Avula announced that the Virginia Department of Health had cleared the city’s water as safe for consumption following negative results from required compliance samples.
“I’m deeply grateful to the residents and businesses for enduring this unexpected boil water advisory,” Avula said. “Residents and businesses expect better, and I am as committed as ever to finding the problems and fixing them. Doing this work requires being honest about what’s working and what’s not and I pledge my ongoing commitment to doing just that.”
Testing began Tuesday night after a sudden drop in water pressure across large parts of the city led to emergency conservation measures and boil orders for neighborhoods served by the Ginter Park tank. 
The first samples were taken at 7 p.m. Tuesday and came back negative by Wednesday evening. A second round collected late Wednesday morning also cleared, with final results received Thursday at 2:30 p.m.
“I’m encouraged that the first round of water sample results has come back with a negative result,” Avula had said Wednesday evening. “Some parts of Richmond are still under a boil water advisory as we await the second sample test, but this is very promising. We’re hopeful for full clearance soon and are so grateful for everyone’s patience and care.”
Residents and businesses across impacted areas — including the Fan, Byrd Park, Carytown, Brookland Park, Jackson Ward, Oregon Hill, and parts of Southside — can now resume normal water use. Food service operations are being directed to state guidance on how to safely reopen.
“This is a sign that we must reevaluate and improve our processes to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” City Council President Cynthia Newbille said, praising the city’s emergency response but calling for systemic improvements.
The boil advisory was triggered by an operational failure early Tuesday morning when clogged filters at the city’s water treatment plant led to low or no pressure across the system. 
Internal records obtained by WTVR indicate that a May 12 maintenance request to clean plate settlers — filters that remove sludge — was postponed two days later because operations staff said “this was not a good time.”

In a legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice interim committee hearing earlier this week, prosecutors from the 1st and 2nd Judicial Districts said staffing shortages at the state’s laboratory, incoming court rules and reliance on federal funding threaten prosecutions of sexual assault cases.
The problems are expanding beyond the historic backlog, which mostly affected Bernalillo County, said Haley Murphy, a deputy district attorney for the 1st Judicial District, which includes Santa Fe, Rio Arriba and Los Alamos counties.
She pointed to one case of a kit submitted to the Department of Public Safety in August 2023, after a 16-year-old made a report of a sexual assault.
“Today, 636 days later, we still don’t have the testing complete on the kit,” Murphy told lawmakers. “We’re now well into a case, 20 months into a case, and the biggest outstanding issue is the lack of scientific testing.”
The state’s forensic lab has a vacancy rate of 30% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to the report card prepared by analysts at the Legislative Finance Committee. The laboratory had 134 sexual assault evidence kits that were not completed within 180 days, the time-frame required by a 2019 state law.
No one from the state’s forensic crime lab attended Tuesday’s hearing.
Murphy said prosecutions are repeatedly being delayed because of the lack of physical evidence.
“We are in a holding pattern, at the mercy of an overwhelmed crime lab,” she said.
The Supreme Court’s proposed changes to the 1st Judicial District court procedures to increase the speed of moving cases to trial, expected in January 2026, compounds the pressure, Murphy said.
“These long delays in testing will absolutely result in a compromise to our community’s safety,” she said. “Individuals will be allowed out of custody; cases will be dismissed; evidence will be suppressed.”
Federal cuts have already impacted the work on trying to clear the 2016 backlog.
According to 2nd Judicial Deputy District Attorney Jack Jacks, federal grants pay for seven of the nine members of the Bernalillo County sexual assault cold case division; all of the further laboratory testing, which often requires shipping out of state; and expert witness fees. He said it’s uncertain for how much longer the federal government will continue to fund the work.
“Like a lot of people in January, I received the email from the Department of Justice saying that the funding was put on hold,” Jacks said. “A few days later, it was said it was not on hold. So there’s a little uncertainty that causes me some concern.”
New and old backlogs in Bernalillo County 
In 2016, a state audit found more than 4,000 untested evidence kits in Bernalillo County, some dating back to the 1980s, accounting for three-quarters of the untested kits across New Mexico. All of the kits were tested by April 2021, but court proceedings continue.
Bernalillo County prosecutors examined 4,281 cases for review and screening based off of the backlog, and dismissed 3,751 cases — approximately 87%. Insufficient evidence followed by statute of limitation constraints primarily caused those dismissals, according to a chart released by the 2nd Judicial District.
Jacks said Bernalillo County prosecutors have brought charges in 82 cases, resulting in 52 convictions, five acquittals and one dismissal, while 24 cases are still pending further action.
At present, 149 cases from the historic backlog remain under review by prosecutors for potential charges, Jacks said. He recommended the district attorney’s office publish a review in 2026 to examine what happened in the 10 years since the initial audit.
Bernalillo County is now experiencing impacts from this “new backlog” that has developed over the last two years, said Savannah Brandenburg-Koch, a deputy district attorney for the 2nd Judicial District special victims unit.
“When we don’t have labs, meeting these deadlines even under the law, when they’re supposed to test the kits, it devastates our cases, and essentially then puts us in a backlog,” Brandenburg-Koch said. “There’s many times where we don’t move forward on a case until we have results, because we don’t want our cases to get dismissed. Because of that, then cases are sitting three, four, five years until that testing is done.”
Lawmakers said they would plan additional sessions this year on the topic.
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) said the Legislature would work to prioritize additional funding, since the state remains flush with record-high revenues.
“We certainly have the money now to alleviate that backlog at some point,” he said.

He was tearing a sheet of paper into small pieces and dropping them in, which distracted students near him working on an essay about the Louisiana Purchase.
Approaching him quietly, I asked why he was out of his seat.
“I just can’t sit still at my desk,” he admitted.
Korey has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which makes it difficult for him to stay focused, follow instructions, and remain seated for long periods. I took Korey to our “safe space” for a five-minute cooldown, where he practiced breathing techniques. Afterward, I took him back to his desk and asked a few questions as he re-engaged in his assignment.
As a mother, teacher, and grandmother of a child with ADHD, I understand Korey’s challenges firsthand. In 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 11.4% of U.S. school-age children had ADHD, with boys 15% more likely to be diagnosed than girls (8%). Alarmingly, Black children with ADHD are more likely to be misdiagnosed or disciplined rather than supported.
To address this, the Arkansas Department of Education must train educators to recognize and support students with ADHD effectively, just like I do with Korey. This training should include strategies that encourage compassion, empathy, and respect.
Educator training should also emphasize differentiated instruction and classroom accommodations. Simple adjustments, such as allowing movement breaks, incorporating hands-on activities, and providing clear instructions, can improve student engagement and academic success. In my classroom, spinning a fidget spinner can provide a physical outlet for students’ excess energy, allowing them to focus better on the task at hand.
Regularly updated professional development programs should also reflect the latest research on neurodiverse students.
As a teacher, I want to ensure that transitions between activities support all students’ need for movement while helping them reflect and stay engaged and focused. Instead of expecting students to sit still and quietly switch tasks, I incorporate movement-based transitions that give them a structured way to release energy.
For example, I assign classroom jobs, such as passing out materials or erasing the board, to give Korey a purposeful task. Also, using call-and-response cues —“When I say ‘reading,’ touch your toes!”— keeps transitions engaging and predictable for all students. I guide my students to reflect on their learning processes by asking reflective questions like “What strategies helped you learn best today?” and “How can you improve for next time?” This self-reflection not only encourages personal growth but also fosters a deeper engagement with the content.
Another solution is mentorship through the Saving Our Sons (SOS) program. This initiative fosters a nurturing environment in the Little Rock School District, inspiring young men to excel academically and engage in their community. Students like Korey benefit from mentors who teach strategies to manage impulses, stay on task, and develop self-awareness. Positive behavior and academic improvement are rewarded with activities such as movie nights, college tours, or sporting events.
The program shows that mentorship significantly benefits ADHD students by helping them develop coping mechanisms, confidence, and motivation.
Additionally, district officials should host public forums in which parents, educators, and community members can exchange resources and strategies for supporting ADHD students at school and home.
Strengthening these partnerships will create a seamless support system, ensuring every child receives the resources they need.
Schools should also work closely with healthcare providers to ensure students receive appropriate assessments and, if needed, accommodations tailored to their needs. The coordination between these entities ensures that ADHD students receive consistent support across all aspects of their learning journey.
Korey, once struggling to remain seated, has since earned multiple A/B Honor Roll recognitions. Providing breaks helped improve his focus and self-regulation, leading to academic success.
When we commit to understanding and accommodating ADHD students, we cultivate not just better learners but future leaders who can confidently navigate the world.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Teacher-with-student.jpg,,,2025-05-29 13:13:21.024448

As the state that advances our workforce and well-being of our society by providing affordable higher public education, or carry on as the 4th most expensive in-state tuition out of all states? 
In early 2024, the average student loan balance in CT rose by $2,359, bringing it up to a total of $40,596, making it $1,713 above the national average & the 10th highest in the U.S. Along with these disheartening statistics, CSUs continue to face budget cuts and rising tuition hikes. These financial burdens harm not only our students and their ability to obtain higher education, but also the future of our state. 
 Evidence shows how they affects students’ quality of life and the citizens of Connecticut. I’ve heard countless personal stories of hardship from fellow students regarding this topic, and I happen to be a part of that group. 

Natalia Sanchez
As a junior at Southern Connecticut State University, when I walk across the stage at graduation next year, I will hold with great pride the honor of being a first-generation college graduate. My parents sacrificed their dreams and abandoned everything they ever knew to come to this country filled with opportunity. My parents have given an arm and a leg to support my dream of obtaining higher education, working countless hours to afford my tuition. I help as much as I can, as I am a full-time student working part-time to be able to afford to come to Southern. 
 Unfortunately, during the start of the 2024-2025 school year, we were no longer able to afford to pay out of pocket, and financial aid was not able to cover as much as in previous years, with the cost of tuition continuously going up. We decided to take out loans to keep me in school. 
Regardless of the financial setback, I was still able to contribute to my institution’s reputation by making the dean’s list with a 3.75 GPA and being a part of my major’s honor society. However, my quality of life, along with my peers, steadily goes down with rising costs, limiting our ability to be the best students we can be.  
This cost burden causes me to reminisce about the amazing assistance that PACT offered me when I was in community college. The PACT program covers the remaining amount after federal and state aid is received, making tuition free for eligible students. 
 As I explored my options for higher education as an upcoming first-generation college student coming out of high school, I realized that due to my limited resources, the chances of obtaining that higher education were looking slim. At the time of my high school graduation, I was working a part-time job while in school, where all my earnings went towards livable expenses and helping my parents, who were already working 50-60 hours a week to make ends meet. 
When I fortunately discovered PACT and was provided the opportunity to go to community college, it changed everything. I originally was supposed to get an associate’s degree at the Norwalk campus of CT State College, but because of PACT, I was filled with hope and inspiration to go after my bachelor’s at Southern. 
Having the help from PACT allowed me to focus the majority of my attention on my studies while still being able to work and financially help my family. The transition from having the help of PACT to relying primarily on financial aid and grants was heavily felt. Not only was I losing PACT, but I was also transitioning to a university with higher tuition that is continuously rising, with resources within that institution getting cut. 
I went from having A’s and B’s, with a position on the Dean’s list in community college, to having B’s and B minuses my first semester at Southern because of how much I was struggling to balance school, work, and financial expenses. It limited my ability to be the best student I could be. Although I was able to turn my grades around by taking out loans, getting help from my parents, and FAFSA, I recognize that there are students with the same, if not more, potential than I who don’t have the same resources. 
For example, this year, I met a classmate who couldn’t register for classes yet. She had a hold on her account and was still paying off her tuition despite her great academic standing. Issues like these hold students back from unlocking their greatest potential. 
I believe that expanding PACT to our CSUs benefits these institutions, as their ranking would increase as students become more devoted to their studies, with financial obligations being lifted. It also benefits the state workforce, as most of our CSU students plan on staying in the state to work.

(Photo: Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images)After Donald Trump tapped him as his running mate, J.D. Vance crisscrossed the country and gave speech after speech in which he, like Trump, demonized immigrants and promised to mount a mass deportation effort if elected.
The Boeing 737 that he used to travel around the nation is now being used to deport immigrants. Records show that it has made at least 16 flights to Central and South American countries to deport immigrants this year.
An Arizona Mirror analysis of publicly available data and records obtained by the University of Washington through Freedom of Information Act requests confirms that the 22-year-old jet is part of the fleet of planes known as “ICE Air” that swiftly shuttles immigrants out of the United States. ICE Air consists of multiple charter airlines and other private aviation companies around the country who are contracted to move immigrant detainees inside and out of the country.
Even before the plane was emblazoned with the Trump campaign logo in July 2024, it had been used at least four times to transport immigrant detainees during an earlier stint on the ICE Air fleet.
Data analyzed by the Mirror and confirmed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher Phil Neff show that the aircraft flew four ICE Air missions in April and May of 2018.
Those four missions consisted of three removal flights to El Salvador and Guatemala, in which deportees were shipped off to those countries. The fourth was a transfer flight, in which detainees were moved from one ICE facility to another.
During those four missions in 2018, the aircraft carried between 456 to 504 passengers, according to ICE passenger data.
And records from 2020 detail 35 flights from known ICE hubs to Central and South American countries.
For example, on March 6, 2020, the aircraft took off from the Alexandria Airport in Louisiana, where ICE has a staging facility operated by private contractor GEO Group. It then landed at the José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador, before returning to Alexandria.
Earlier this year, that same airport was where military planes deported migrants.
Data on flights after 2018 is more difficult to confirm. ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security began redacting identifying information of the aircraft used in the deportation process, making it more difficult to see the movements of individual planes, though it is still possible in some cases. Civil rights groups have been fighting for records about the program, while the agency regularly slow-walks records releases.
“Our experience in general with FOIAs — not just with the Department of Homeland Security, but especially with the Department of Homeland Security — is you should expect to have to sue to get information and for us that process involves getting approval from the highest level of the university,” Neff told the Mirror. “So, we have had to be very selective in the case in which we have had to do that.”
Just five months after Trump and Vance won the election, the aircraft flew between multiple airports known for ICE Air activity before heading to an airport in Honduras known for deportation flights, then coming to rest at Mesa Gateway Airport.
It is not clear if Trump or Vance were aware of the aircraft’s history prior to it becoming part of their campaign. A spokesperson for the White House directed the Mirror to the Department of Homeland Security and Vance’s office. Vance and DHS did not respond.
From ferrying travelers to deportees
The aircraft, N917XA, has a long and interesting history.
It started its life in the fleet of the now defunct Air Berlin before transferring to Orenair, another ill-fated airline based in Russia, until it was acquired by Swift Air.
Swift Air was a subcontractor for ICE and has previously conducted flights out of Mesa Gateway Airport, one of ICE’s major airport hubs. Flight history shows the plane has made multiple flights to and from Mesa Gateway to other ICE airport hubs, as well as to Central and South American countries.
A previous inspector general report listed the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway airport as the operational headquarters for ICE Air.
Swift Air rebranded as iAero Airways in 2019, but went bankrupt in 2024. Eastern Air Express acquired much of iAero’s assets, including N917XA, in April 2024. Three months later, it was unveiled as Vance’s campaign jet. Eastern Air Express has also taken over the ICE Air contracts that iAero held.
The company also has connections to the Trump world.
From 1989 to 1992, Trump owned an airline company called “Trump Shuttle,” which he purchased after meeting the Eastern Air Express CEO at a party. But the endeavor, like so many of Trump’s businesses, was financially doomed and failed.
ICE Air activities heat up in Arizona
ICE Air operations in Arizona are beginning to ramp up as well, with Avelo Airlines starting to make deportation flights out of Mesa Gateway this month, amid financial woes and market competition.
Contracts to conduct deportation flights are lucrative for the companies involved. The Project on Government Oversight has reported that CSI Aviation, whose corporate director was a “fake elector” in New Mexico for Trump, was awarded a no-bid contract to the tune of $128 million.
Neff said he wasn’t surprised to learn that the aircraft which had been used for deportations had been utilized by the Trump campaign, although he did say there was an “irony to it.”
During their research, Neff said they found that some of the contractors would often boast about how they could turn aircraft around from passenger style to luxury style on short notice, even finding aircraft that had previously been used for deportations later being used to shuttle professional sports teams or musicians around the country.
Immigrant advocates have been critical of the flights and say they raise a number of human rights and civil rights issues. Neff said those concerns are only being exacerbated by the Trump administration’s push to speed up deportations.
“I think it is really impossible to overstate or understand the true scope of human impacts of a deportation program on this scale,” Neff said.
During their initial research, which covered flights between 2010 and 2020, Neff said they found a “significant portion” of the passengers being deported still had ongoing cases that had not worked their way through the courts. The Trump administration has recently been defending its use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans, to do rapid deportations.
Once on the planes, immigrants are shackled at their feet and hands for the duration of the flight. In testimony in a class action lawsuit against the United States, where passengers were shackled for 23 hours sitting on the tarmac, some soiled themselves as they were denied access to the bathroom.
Abuse on ICE Air flights have been reported going back to 2016, when some passengers were left bloodied after being beaten and placed in body-bag style restraints. In some cases, deaths and miscarriages have been reported on ICE Air flights.
And transparency about the flights is getting worse, Neff noted.
While the first round of data obtained by researchers contained information such as flight destinations, flight costs and the tail numbers of aircraft, the government redacted that information from future releases.
While public flight history data is available to researchers, those researchers are working overtime to help track these flights.
“It is 8 or 10 hours, 7 days a week. It is a significant amount of time,” immigration activist Tom Cartwright, who has been voluntarily tracking ICE flights since Trump’s first term, told the Mirror.
During that time, Cartwright has noticed that tracking the aircraft has gotten considerably more difficult, as federal agencies have sought to stymie watchdogs from monitoring the program by removing their aircraft from flight-tracking services.
But Cartwright and others have still found other ways to keep a watchful eye on the program.
“The transparency has gotten worse over time and worse under the (second) Trump administration,” Cartwright said, adding that taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent. “To send some of these flights with relatively few people on them at a million dollars a flight seems pretty ridiculous, to be honest.”
The coming weeks and months are likely to keep Cartwright busy, as deportation flights have been ramping up. In the last couple of weeks, Cartwright said he has noticed flights have “accelerated quite a bit,” and he said is anticipating May to be a record-breaking month for total flights.
Cartwright said his work is important because it sends a message to those on the flights — and those their deportation left behind in America.
“The people on the planes deserve the dignity of someone giving a damn,” he said. “All these people on these planes, they have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles. They deserve the dignity of someone understanding that they are being sent away to somewhere that, in some cases, they haven’t seen in years or somewhere that is dangerous or where they won’t be able to support their family.”

Read this story in English.
El programa EBT de verano proporciona una inyección adicional de fondos para alimentos durante el verano, cuando los niños no asisten a la escuela y no tienen acceso a desayunos y almuerzos gratuitos o a precio reducido. Este es el segundo año que el programa, conocido a nivel federal como SUN Bucks, se ofrece a familias elegibles.
Connecticut es uno de los 38 estados, junto con varias naciones tribales y territorios estadounidenses, que participan en SUN Bucks este año. A través del programa, las familias reciben un beneficio único de $120 por niño para gastar en alimentos. Se espera que alrededor de 300,000 niños en Connecticut se beneficien de la iniciativa este año.
¿Necesito inscribirme?
Según Daniel Giacomi, director de supervisión de programas y administración de subvenciones del Departamento de Servicios Sociales (DSS), la mayoría de las familias no tendrán que solicitar el programa, sino que se inscribirán automáticamente en el programa. Esto incluye a los niños de entre 5 y 18 años que reciben beneficios del SNAP o Asistencia Familiar Temporal (TFF), que reciben la tarjeta HUSKY A con ingresos iguales o inferiores al 185% del umbral de pobreza federal, y a los niños que solicitaron el programa nacional de almuerzos escolares en su escuela y fueron elegibles para el año escolar 2024-25. En total, el DSS afirma que el 97% de los beneficiarios se inscribirán automáticamente.
Si su hijo no se encuentra en ninguna de estas categorías, pero los ingresos de su hogar son inferiores al 185% del umbral de pobreza federal, puede solicitar el programa visitando este enlace, a partir de junio. El DSS informa que la inscripción aún no está disponible porque siguen realizando mejoras en la solicitud.
¿Cuándo comenzarán los beneficios?
Los beneficios se añadirán a las tarjetas EBT a finales de junio o principios de julio, pero aún no se ha confirmado una fecha precisa, según el DSS. Si bien el año pasado los beneficios se retrasaron debido a que las agencias de Connecticut no coordinaron eficazmente el lanzamiento del programa, Giacomi afirmó que no cree que haya un problema similar este verano.
“Aprovechamos las lecciones del año pasado y los contratiempos que trajo consigo para minimizar la repetición del mismo problema, por lo que, por el momento, no prevemos ningún problema para distribuir los beneficios a tiempo”, afirmó.
¿Para qué se puede usar el dinero?
Al igual que el programa SNAP, el dinero solo se puede usar para comprar alimentos y no para comprar comida preparada. No se puede usar en restaurantes, pero sí para comprar alimentos del supermercado o del mercado de agricultores, y para comprar plantas que se utilizan para cultivar alimentos.
También hay varios mercados de agricultores en todo el estado que ofrecen la duplicación de SNAP, de modo que se pueden comprar productos agrícolas por valor de $20 con 10 dólares SNAP, por ejemplo.
¿Por qué es necesario el programa?
Durante los meses de verano, los niños que dependen de comidas escolares a precios reducidos o gratuitos pierden repentinamente esa fuente de alimento. El programa EBT de verano fue creado por el Congreso en 2022 y es operado por el Departamento de Agricultura de EE. UU. para cubrir esa necesidad.
“Sabemos que los niños están en casa. Sabemos, obviamente, que tienen hambre. Yo mismo tengo dos hijos y comen más de lo que jamás imaginé que comerían los niños pequeños”, dijo Giacomi. “Por lo tanto, cualquier cantidad, cualquier financiación para aliviar la carga sobre sus familias, vale la pena y haremos todo lo posible para continuar y operar de la manera más eficiente posible”.
¿Afectarán los recortes federales al programa?
Mientras el Congreso debate actualmente un proyecto de ley fiscal que podría recortar los beneficios del SNAP en aproximadamente un 30%, Giacomi dijo que aún no está claro si el programa EBT de verano se verá afectado.
“Estamos tomando este año como viene. Hemos recibido la aprobación para operar el programa, así que de esta manera es como procederemos”, dijo. “Pero, obviamente, estamos en comunicación con nuestros socios federales, tanto del Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA) como de nuestra delegación en el Congreso, para determinar si habrá algún desafío operativo en los próximos años”.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) at the Mackinac Policy Conference's Women in Leadership panel on May 28, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonDuring the annual women in leadership panel at the Mackinac Policy conference, leaders from the public and private sectors spoke out against growing federal efforts opposing diversity, equity and inclusion practices, emphasizing that diversity remains a value within the state. 
The panel, led by Laura Granneman, the executive director of Rocket Community Fund and Gilbert Family Foundation, hosted U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly); Tina Kozak, CEO of the PR firm Franco; and Angelique Power, president and CEO of the Skillman Foundation, which advocates for Detroiters’ perspectives in education policy. 
Looking across the nation at the push against diversity, Slotkin said there’s a narrative circulating that diversity is a bad thing rather than a good thing. 
“It’s sending shock waves of fear through the system and the conversations I’m having with Michigan organizations is like, ‘Please don’t over index’, right? Don’t bend over backwards to, like, go the opposite direction. We’re in Michigan. You know diversity is a value,” Slotkin said, warning that organizations are going too far in responding to anti-DEI sentiments and actions. 
While the federal government has taken action to end DEI policies in the federal government, the sentiment goes beyond that, Slotkin said, pointing to President Donald Trump blaming diversity initiatives for January’s deadly aircraft collision at Washington Reagan National Airport. 
“This isn’t about DEI, right? This is about saying that in order for me to champion one group of people, I have to put down a whole bunch of other groups of people,” Slotkin said.

“The challenge for us in Michigan, is to say, how do we communicate and call balls and strikes on what we know is right for our state and for our institutions. And you just have to look around at this conference and say, like, there is value in having a different group of voices around a table,” Slotkin said. 
Power noted that it had been five years since the murder of George Floyd, and that a tremendous amount of work on diversity, equity and inclusion work followed. 
“I don’t want us to lose that. That the work that was done was different than the DEI work — or the DI the diversity and inclusion work — that was done before,” Power said. 
“These last five years, there was such a introspective lens that institutions took, that individuals took to say, like, ‘What can I do differently?’ There was a realization that it isn’t about solely representation, it was about ownership and agency and voice. It was about creating new tables. And that worked so well that there is this tremendous backlash against it now,” Power said. 
The issue now is not about defending an acronym, but rather defending American values, Power said.

“In two years we’re going to celebrate the 250th anniversary of our country. ‘We the People’. That’s our chance to say, when we first said, ‘We the People,’ it really meant, like, you know, white men. Now we get a chance to say who we really mean by ‘We the People’,” Power said. 
While Kozak said she didn’t have much to add, she noted it was frustrating to see a resistance to forward motion. 
However, she remained hopeful, arguing that the state and businesses understand the importance of diversity. 
“Investing in women is good business. And I believe that, and I believe that corporations know that. I think they’re calling it different things to your point, to sort of over-correct and protect, but I’m hopeful,” Kozak. 
  Franco CEO Tina Kozak at the Mackinac Policy Conference’s Women in Leadership panel on May 28, 2025. | Kyle Davidson
Later in the panel Power detailed the importance of coalition building in the philanthropic realm, with foundation presidents working in coalitions all across the nation.
However, President Trump’s executive order opposing DEI has targeted universities and foundations with more than $500 million in assets, accusing these groups of illegal discrimination in order to strip their nonprofit status and fine them into submission, Power said. 
This includes Black Lives Matter-oriented organizations and groups working to support climate justice in low income areas and communities of color who are disproportionately impacted by climate change, she said.
“Truthfully, I think all of us watched the university presidents and we saw what happens when you go it alone, when an attack comes at you and you try to handle it with talking points that were handed to you,” Power said.
“Whether it’s nationally, or whether it’s locally, whether it’s within this current context, or whether it has to do with the education system, we have to solve this together,” Power said. “And that’s actually one of the best things about Michigan. We’re a proudly purple state. We are not going to make progress unless we have bipartisan ideas that we move through and that we can sustain.”

Officials announced Tuesday that the Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) has reserved $5.5 million in funding for 15 development projects across four municipalities through the state’s Downtown Development District (DDD) program.
The funding is intended to help catalyze $173.6 million in private investment in revitalization efforts in Dover, Laurel, Georgetown, and Wilmington. Projects receiving reservations include Villa Maria at Brandywine, The Old Post, Laurel Redevelopment Corporation, and Orange Street Lot, LLC.
“Across Delaware, Downtown Development Districts are critical to creating vibrant, walkable neighborhoods where both families and small businesses can thrive,” said Governor Matt Meyer. 
“We’re doubling down on those efforts with more investment, faster permitting, and making sure that affordable housing is part of every conversation about sustainable growth.”
Now in its tenth year, the DDD program was established by the General Assembly in 2014 to promote private investment in commercial districts and neighborhoods across Delaware. The initiative provides a 20% state rebate on eligible property improvements in designated districts, including structural, interior, and exterior upgrades.

“This year we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Downtown Development District program, and the 427 residential, commercial, and mixed-use projects completed since 2015 are a testament to the program’s resounding success,” said DSHA Director Matthew Heckles.
“It shows that through strategic investments and public-private partnerships, we can create new homes and new businesses, leading to more jobs, historic preservation, and revitalized communities in Delaware’s towns and cities. Investing in our downtowns means investing in our residents. I’m proud of the impact the DDDs have had and am thankful for the state appropriations and private investments that have made this possible.”
The program has designated 12 districts statewide: Wilmington, Dover, Seaford, Georgetown, Harrington, Laurel, Milford, Smyrna, the City of New Castle, Clayton, Delaware City, and Middletown. Since its inception, $39.2 million in state rebates have supported $574.7 million in private investment across these districts.

Large project reservations, such as the ones announced this week, are awarded through a competitive application process. Investors must complete their projects and submit final documentation to receive funding. Projects must exceed $350,000 in eligible costs, while a separate program for small projects between $25,000 and $350,000 is currently closed for the fiscal year.

Hundreds of Catholics conducted a counter-protest in opposition of Satanic Grotto's presence in Topeka. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas satanist group appear to be off the hook for criminal charges that stemmed from a highly anticipated, hotly criticized black mass demonstration at the Statehouse that resulted in clashes with Catholics and, ultimately, their arrests.
Shawnee County prosecutors decided Wednesday not to pursue charges against Michael Stewart, leader of the Satanic Grotto, and two other group members. After the court hearing, Stewart returned to the Statehouse to discuss the details of his next protest with law enforcement.
Attracting nationwide attention, Stewart’s satanic protest in March drew ire from elected and religious officials. Hundreds gathered at the Statehouse in Topeka on March 28, some in support of the satanic organization, which is a nonprofit not affiliated with the Church of Satan, and others in vehement opposition.
About 11:30 a.m., following speeches, prayers, chants and sign-waving on the lawn of the Statehouse in Topeka, Stewart entered the building to perform a satanic ceremony, called the black mass, which can involve desecrating a host. Across the street, a Catholic mass and prayer service took place, where archbishop of Kansas City Joseph Naumann lambasted nonbelievers. Naumann also tried to sue Stewart before the protests, falsely accusing him of stealing a consecrated host. 
Stewart had a permit to demonstrate outside on Statehouse grounds and was warned as he entered the building that any protest would violate that permit.
He walked to the first-floor rotunda, accompanied by supporters, reporters and watchful counter-protestors and began a dedication to Satan.
A man and woman with young children interrupted him, physically intervening. Stewart turned away, and then a counter-protestor, Marcus Schroeder, attempted twice to grab papers from Stewart’s hands. On Schroeder’s second reach, Stewart punched him twice in the face before a law enforcement officer took his legs out from underneath him.
Stewart and two supporters were booked in jail and charged with unlawful gathering. Stewart faced an additional charge of disorderly conduct.
At a hearing Wednesday, county prosecutors said they don’t plan to pursue charges at this time, Stewart told Kansas Reflector. However, the statute of limitations lasts five years.
A call to the Shawnee County District Attorney’s Office seeking confirmation of the charges was not immediately returned Wednesday.
After the hearing, Stewart traveled a few blocks to the Capitol building, where he talked about plans for a nighttime protest in August with a law enforcement officer to preemptively soothe any concerns.
Planned for early August, Stewart envisions the “Witches Hour Protest” taking place from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the Statehouse’s south lawn.
He plans to extend the invitation to Wiccans, pagans and “any kind of witchy inclined hippie we can find.”
“We’re happy that we’re able to get back at it,” Stewart said.
He added the members of the grotto have been “restless,” as they awaited their fate.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-arrest-peace-signs-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-29 11:05:49.208835

As the nation marks both Mental Health Awareness Month and Older Americans Month this May, new research sheds light on where seniors are thriving the most — and Delaware has emerged as one of the top states for senior happiness.
A recent study by Caring.com placed Delaware in third place nationwide in its Senior Happiness Index, which evaluated a range of factors including happiness levels, access to senior centers, and health metrics among Americans aged 60 and over.

The First State tied for third with a score of 7.01 out of 10, reflecting its strong performance in both senior health and happiness.
Delaware ranks 9th in overall senior health and scored 60.43 out of 100 in happiness, highlighting the state’s appeal as a retirement destination.
It was also recently named the best state for retirement in 2024.
As Americans live longer, it’s clear that quality of life — not just longevity — matters deeply, the study found.
States like Delaware, which invest in senior well-being, serve as examples of how we can support older populations, it continued.
The study also highlighted other senior-friendly states:

Hawaii ranks highest for overall senior happiness.
North Dakota leads the nation in the number of senior centers per capita.
West Virginia offers the most affordable cost of living for older Americans.

The findings arrive at a time when mental health remains a growing concern among older adults.
According to Caring.com, 15% of Americans over 50 report struggling with mental health issues.

The ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based U.S. Court of International Trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs exceeded his authority and left the country’s trade policy dependent on his whims.
Trump has repeatedly said the tariffs would force manufacturers to bring back factory jobs to the U.S. and generate enough revenue to reduce federal budget deficits. He used the tariffs as a negotiating cudgel in hopes of forcing other nations to negotiate agreements that favored the U.S., suggesting he would simply set the rates himself if the terms were unsatisfactory.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that trade deficits amount to a national emergency “that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base — facts that the court did not dispute.”
The administration, he said, remains “committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.”
But for now, Trump might not have the threat of import taxes to exact his will on the world economy as he had intended, since doing so would require congressional approval. What remains unclear is whether the White House will respond to the ruling by pausing all of its emergency power tariffs in the interim.
Trump might still be able to temporarily launch import taxes of 15% for 150 days on nations with which the U.S. runs a substantial trade deficit. The ruling notes that a president has this authority under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974.
The ruling amounted to a categorical rejection of the legal underpinnings of some of Trump’s signature and most controversial actions of his four-month-old second term. The administration swiftly filed notice of appeal — and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer — but it casts a sharp blow.
The case was heard by three judges: Timothy Reif, who was appointed by Trump, Jane Restani, named to the bench by President Ronald Reagan and Gary Katzman, an appointee of President Barack Obama.
“The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,” the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
The ruling left in place any tariffs that Trump put in place using his Section 232 powers from the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. He put a 25% tax on most imported autos and parts, as well as on all foreign-made steel and aluminum. Those tariffs depend on a Commerce Department investigation that reveals national security risks from imported products.
It was filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court that deals specifically with civil lawsuits involving international trade law.
While tariffs must typically be approved by Congress, Trump has said he has the power to act to address the trade deficits he calls a national emergency.
He is facing at least seven lawsuits challenging the levies. The plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorize the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit is not an emergency because the U.S. has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.
Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America’s massive and long-standing trade deficits. He earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.
His administration argues that courts approved then-President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the “political” question of whether the president’s rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.
Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world’s largest economy.
The lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive.
A dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon. “This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,” Attorney General Dan Rayfield said.
Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the tariffs had “jacked up prices on groceries and cars, threatened shortages of essential goods and wrecked supply chains for American businesses large and small.″",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25130034695823-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 11:05:49.208835

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order aiming to reinstate “common sense” school discipline, more states may follow and expand the authority of teachers and school officials to deal with disruptive students.
The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.
During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
Restorative justice models
In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
Calls for a cultural shift on expectations
While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.
Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

The guidance comes years after a New Haven firefighter was killed in the line of duty.
New Haven Fire Chief John Alston said the fire department already began some improvements before the report was issued.
“This report reaffirms many things that we already know,” Alston said. “One is that there’s no substitute for preparation, leadership and immediate action.”
The report comes four years after New Haven firefighter, Ricardo Torres Jr., was killed battling a fire inside of a multi-family home in the city on Valley St. back in 2021.
Mayor Justin Elicker and Alston said they also added resources by other city departments in response. The NIOSH report issued nine recommendations. The suggestions include increasing staff in support roles, a dedicated rapid response team and better communication, among others.
The report also goes into further detail regarding the circumstances of Torres’ death. Torres, according to the report, entered the second floor of a two story home on May 12, 2021. He ended up getting separated from his crew and died of asphyxia after his oxygen tank emptied. Another firefighter, a lieutenant, ended up needing assistance after calling in for help.
Miguel Rosado, a deputy chief and firefighter union president for Local 825, said the department will address the recommendations.
“There’s a lot of recommendations in the report that I look forward to working with both the city and the chief’s office to make sure that they’re implemented, to make this a safer department,” Rosado said.
The report calls for improved unit integrity, a term used by first responders to describe teamwork and working relationships within their organizations.

Advocates and care providers are asking the state to bolster and expand its nation-leading abortion and transgender care shield law. Better data security and limiting who can share patient information are key, they say, as other states ramp up efforts to prosecute doctors across state lines.
The post On reproductive and transgender care, Massachusetts urged[...]","MASSACHUSETTS MAY HAVE been the first state to pass a sweeping shield law protecting patients and providers of reproductive and gender-affirming care across state lines, but the national landscape has shifted in three years and advocates are anxiously asking lawmakers to close gaps in the legislation. “There’s so much fear,” Polly Crozier, a senior staff attorney at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, told the Senate Committee on Steering and Policy on Wednesday. “And of course no law’s a silver bullet … but since the January 20 gender ideology executive order, it feels like the world for transgender people has completely changed, and that really impacts their providers as well.” The committee is gathering information that may inform legislation that would update and strengthen a 2022 law passed after the US Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.  Under the law, Massachusetts defines reproductive care and gender-affirming care as legally protected health care and bars officials from cooperating with another state’s investigation or prosecution of its providers. Thousands have received Massachusetts-based care since Roe was overturned and the shield law passed, according to the state attorney general’s office. Including Massachusetts, 18 states and Washington, DC have passed abortion shield laws, with six including protections for telehealth providers who prescribe medication to patients in other states that may criminalize the practice.  Bills pending on Beacon Hill look to update the existing law, including a bill filed by Sen. Cindy Friedman, who oversaw Wednesday’s hearing, and another focused on data privacy refiled by Rep. Kate Lipper-Garabedian and Rep. David Vieira.  Those before the committee pointed to several loopholes in the current law that they argued need to be addressed.  Allyson Slater, director of the reproductive justice unit in Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office, said the AG is hoping for several updates including: an extension of a ban on sharing protected health care data giving her office the explicit authority to enforce the shield law; increased protection of this sensitive health data; that all medical professionals in these specialties including midwives and attorneys be protected; and that the state ensures that Massachusetts courts do not recognize out of state findings of child abuse leveled against parents who allow their children to receive gender-affirming care. Providers have been nervously watching developments like the indictment of a New York physician for shipping abortion medications to a woman in Louisiana. The attorney general’s office said it was not aware of current efforts to enforce laws about children transitioning against Massachusetts practitioners. The modern system of electronic medical records – acknowledged by speakers and lawmakers as essential and long sought – now carries risks to patients and providers.  “Medical records that I use to document my care are almost certainly visible to someone in another state,” said Dr Chloe Zera, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess. Providers “face real and growing threats for doing our jobs. Anti-abortion states are attempting to criminalize care that is fully legal here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.” Prescriptions for mifepristone and misoprostol – medications used together to terminate an early pregnancy – can be seen by anyone with access to medication orders and dispensing histories, she said. Other states have been able to access the data of interstate patients, Zera said. A college student who received abortion medication in Massachusetts would have that on their medical record in Texas if they returned home, for instance. Advocates asked that the law be amended to require specific consent from patients to allow access to sensitive reproductive care and gender care data, along with provisions that certain data be kept out of prescription monitoring programs that could be accessed by the federal government and officials in other states.  Prescription drug monitoring programs are in place in almost every US state, established to prevent the abuse of prescription drugs, notably opioids, noted Gavi Wolfe, the legislative director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. “There is no reason that medications related to reproductive health and gender-affirming care need to be included in its vast database and vulnerable to prying eyes,” Wolfe said. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing doctors for prescribing gender-affirming care to minors, Wolfe noted, uncovered by accessing the state’s drug monitoring program. The ACLU supported New Hampshire when it challenged a federal Drug Enforcement Administration subpoena for two years of a patient’s medical record through the state monitoring program, without a warrant as required by state law. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the state in 2022.  Wolfe urged legislators on Wednesday to extend the shield law’s ban on law enforcement from sharing protected medical information. It should also apply to other government bodies like the Department of Public Health, he said.  “We should ensure that when patients and providers interact with any state actors, not just law enforcement, they can trust that their information will not be voluntarily shared with hostile out of state entities,” he said. Some of the updates under consideration could have unintended consequences, senators observed.  State Sen. Jo Comerford of Northampton asked Slater, from the AG’s office, if the office is “anticipating unintended consequences” to the changes. Specifically, Comerford worried that hiding access to health care information could create barriers around access to care or stymie health equity initiatives. “Should we be mindful of any of those or ways to structure the health care information protection so we don’t inadvertently block it off from people we want to see it granted to?” she asked. Slater’s response was a familiar refrain on Wednesday: The stakes are high, and the risks are already being seen in other states.  “We are constantly trying to understand what the unintended consequences could be on the restriction of health care data,” she said. They are looking at models in states like California on data access restriction, she said, but “addressing the immediate harm is the hope of our office.” The post On reproductive and transgender care, Massachusetts urged not to rest on its laurels appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/0GoldDome.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-29 11:05:49.208835

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The city of Leavenworth has not given up its fight to force CoreCivic to follow development processes before reopening its prison facility as an ICE detention center.
The city refiled in Leavenworth District court this week after losing its case in U.S. District Court last week. Leavenworth officials asked for an injunction that would stop CoreCivic from housing detainees until the court could decide whether the private prison company must obtain a special use permit.
CoreCivic operated the Leavenworth Detention Facility until 2021 and has signed a contract with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to reopen the prison as the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
However, city of Leavenworth officials said CoreCivic must apply for a special use permit before it can reopen.
City manager Scott Peterson said in an email the city refiled in state court because it was “following the logic” of Judge Toby Crouse, whose ruling dismissed the case because he was not convinced it should be heard in federal court.
At a city council meeting Tuesday, several people stood up to thank city officials for fighting to keep the prison from reopening. Mike Trapp, a former Columbia, Missouri, city councilman, noted how important it was for CoreCivic to follow development regulations.
“Land-use decisions are the fundamental core government response,” he said. “You function as the board of directors for the city, you pass the laws, but the biggest thing you do is deal with zoning and platting issues, and land-use as the most fundamental and core function of government. And to see that challenged is unfortunate.”
Peterson said the case has never been about politics, as CoreCivic’s lawyer claimed during the U.S. District Court case.
“The city commission, composed of a healthy mixture of liberals and conservatives alike, chose unanimously to file this suit to protect the city of Leavenworth’s power to govern development within its jurisdiction,” he said. “All that the city of Leavenworth has ever asked of CoreCivic in this matter is to go through the Special Use Permit process, as outlined by the Leavenworth Development Regulations.”
CoreCivic had agreed that it would not allow any detainees in the facility until June 1 while the case was in court. Peterson said the city hopes that remains true.
“We also hope that CoreCivic will act upon their vocal commitment to be good partners with the city of Leavenworth by not proceeding with any use of the Midwest Regional Reception Center until such time that this matter has been resolved,” he said.
Ryan Gustin, CoreCivic spokesman, would not answer questions about when the company would begin accepting detainees after last week’s win.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P1010070-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-29 10:12:25.568262

Cheshire said he will remain with the housing authority in an advisory role to maintain continuity while his replacement is “brought up to speed” on the workings of the organization.
“This has been in the works for almost two years, at least a year and a half,” Cheshire said. “My board has known this is the plan and the mayor (Allen Joines) has known this is the plan.”
Cheshire said his pending departure is unrelated to the call from some tenants and local housing activists for his resignation over concerns about his management of the city’s aging public housing high rises. Tenants have complained that Cheshire is inattentive to their concerns and has failed to maintain safe and sanitary housing at several apartment complexes managed by HAWS.
“I had sort of anticipated that the folks who were being the most vocal demanding my resignation had already gotten wind of the fact that my resignation was imminent, and that they were planning strategically to take credit for something they knew was already coming,” Cheshire said. “Whether that’s the case, I still have no idea. But no, it [calls for his resignation] didn’t [play a role] because that decision had already been made.”
In an online post, the group Housing Justice Now, a tenant advocacy group that has been critical of Cheshire’s leadership, celebrated the departure as a victory.
“He has ignored needed public housing renovations while pouring millions into the HAWS office building, underutilized Section 8 vouchers, bungled a $30 million Choice Neighborhoods grant, pursued retaliatory evictions, and pushed through a meaningless rebrand of the agency,” the group said. “Tenant organizing at Crystal Towers, Healy Towers, Cleveland Avenue, and across our city made it impossible for Cheshire to push through even more bad policies. Make no mistake, this resignation is an organizing victory! And we demand the next executive director be truly dedicated to low-income housing!”
Dan Rose, an activist with Housing Justice Now, said Cheshire has not served Winston-Salem well.
“The fact that Mayor Joines believes he did shows that the problem is not isolated to one public official,” Rose said. “Residents that are directly affected by the housing crisis should be selecting the housing authority’s next leader; not the mayor’s out-of-touch board of commissioners.”
Andrew Perkins, chairman of the HAWS Board of Commissioners, said the board will be “genuinely sorry” to see Chesire step down.
“We have known for over a year that he wanted to transition once he completed some very important initiatives for the Housing Authority,” Perkins said. “Kevin and his team have worked closely with the board and have accomplished everything we asked of them and more.”
Perkins said Cheshire and his team have made great progress in creating more affordable housing. He noted the $30 million Choice Neighborhoods Initiative redevelopment grant Cheshire helped to secure from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development – the first to be awarded in North Carolina.
Cheshire joined HAWS in 2013 as vice president of real estate development and general counsel. After a national search following the retirement of former executive director Larry Woods, Cheshire was promoted to the position in January 2020.
“I’ve been here 12 years, and this was never something I intended to do for 20 or 30 years,” Cheshire said. “There were some very specific tasks that the board and I discussed when I first stepped into the role. I was committed to doing everything in my power to completing those tasks and then stepping aside to allow someone else to build on that foundation.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4199-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-29 10:12:25.568262

Benson was speaking during a session promoting her book, “The Purposeful Warrior: Standing Up for What’s Right When the Stakes Are High,” during the Mackinac Policy Conference on Wednesday.
She said it would be part of her platform to make Michigan “the best place to be a kid, raise a kid and call home.”
“Transit in our state, and mobility, is this massively unsolved problem an issue that is holding us back from attracting some of the best talent and some of the best businesses,” Benson said.
She said possible routes include from Detroit to Traverse City, with stops in Flint and Saginaw along the way; from Detroit to the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Ann Arbor and Chicago; and from Detroit, through Oakland County and onto Lansing and Grand Rapids.
“We can do it quickly, we can do it efficiently and we can deliver those results to make sure Michigan is the best place to call home, so people can move around with ease,” Benson said.
Benson said other states, like Florida, have been successful in implementing similar transit systems.
She said in an interview with the Michigan Advance that public-private partnerships would be key to making it happen.
“To me, getting things done as governor is getting things like that done – big things that we haven’t been able to get done, but if we did, it would be transformational,” Benson said.

Benson said she would also create a department on arts, culture, tourism and sports if elected governor, which would “lead the way in investing in places for people to move, to grow and to create industries that will generate content, whether it’s filmmaking or more broadly in the arts.”
“What will be critical to us being able to turn around the population decline in the state is creating places where people want to create things and thrive,” Benson said.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Most of the tariffs on imports that have been decreed by Donald Trump were ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of International Trade Wednesday.
While markets were rallying Thursday at the prospect of a halt to Trump’s trade wars, it is unclear whether the ruling will mark a dramatic curtailment of Trump’s tariffs or merely add to global economic chaos and confusion Trump’s policies have created.
Trump has claimed his tariffs are authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which was passed by Congress a half century ago. Trump is the first president to cite the act as the legal basis for establishing tariffs. 
Trump had declared that fentanyl trafficking was an “emergency” warranting tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada, and that trade imbalances with other nations was an “emergency” warranting his worldwide retaliatory tariffs announced on April 2, which Trump dubbed “liberation day.”
Trumps’ “assertion of tariff-making authority… exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA,” the three member federal court unanimously ruled Wednesday.
Citing the IEEPA, the court noted the act “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared,” and the law “may not be exercised for any other purpose.” 
“Because of the Constitution’s express allocation of the tariff power to Congress, we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,” the court’s ruling said. 
Under the Constitution, Congress “shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,” and also has the power  “To regulate commerce with foreign nations.”
There have been attempts by some members of Congress, including some Republicans, to reassert congressional authority over Trump’s tariffs, but those efforts have failed to win the support of a significant number of Republicans who control Congress.
The court’s ruling Wednesday effectively declared congressional inaction “an unlimited delegation of tariff authority” and “an improper abdication of legislative power to another branch of government,” adding “simply with separation of powers in mind, any interpretation of IEEPA that delegates unlimited tariff authority is unconstitutional.”
The case against Trump’s tariff authority was led by the attorneys general of Oregon and Arizona, and joined by several other AGs, including Nevada’s Aaron Ford.
“The president had no legal authority to impose these tariffs, and his unlawful actions would have caused billions of dollars of damage to the American economy,” Ford said in a statement Wednesday. “This decision is a win for the rule of law and for Nevadans’ pocketbooks.” 
But the impact of the Wednesday’s court decision remains unclear. The Trump administration immediately signaled it will appeal the trade court’s ruling. And economists and analysts note Trump could turn to interpretations of laws other than the IEEP to claim authority to impose tariffs.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trumptariffs-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 10:12:25.568262

Tamela Peterson, the CEO of Oxford Center, is charged with second-degree murder, which carries up to a life sentence. Oxford Center employees Jeffrey Alan Mosteller and Gary Marken also face the second-degree murder charge, with all three defendants having the alternative lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter should the court not deem second-degree muder appropriate in the case. Aleta Moffitt, another Oxford center employee is charged with involuntary manslaughter and falsifying medical records.
The dates for the preliminary exams are set for September 15 and 16 after Oakland County Judge Maureen McGinnis said Wednesday that there were additional motions attorneys would be filing that might require a few months to resolve.
The death of 5-year-old Thomas Cooper of Royal Oak was preventable, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office is prosecuting the case, said back in March when her office charged staff members of the Oxford Center with murder and involuntary manslaughter.

“Instead, deliberate negligence and a blatant disregard for safety cost a child his life,” Nessel said in a statement. 
Cooper had received many in the hyperbaric oxygen chamber for ADHD and sleep apnea, attorney for the Cooper family James Harrington told WXYZ in February. But during the 36th treatment on Jan. 31, the chamber exploded with Cooper inside.
Cooper’s mother tried to save her child, but could not get him out of the chamber, Harrington said.
“Under no circumstances should anything like this ever happen, ever,” Harrington told WXYZ. “She was in the waiting room and was alerted that something was going wrong and rushed back, and he was engulfed in flames and she was trying to get him out and sustained significant burns to her arm.”
The Michigan Attorney General’s Office is arguing that employees of the Oxford Center showed complete disregard for patient safety, ignoring safety protocols for the highly sensitive environment hyperbaric oxygen chambers create, using chambers beyond the scope set by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.
Whereas the air people breathe everyday is 21% oxygen, the air inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber is 100% oxygen and can help patients heal wounds or fight off infection, according to the FDA. Conditions the FDA approves usage of hyperbaric oxygen chambers include crush injuries, burns, severe infections and sudden vision loss, but neither of the conditions Harrington said Copper had been receiving treatment for.
The Oxford Center lists dozens of conditions hyperbaric oxygen chambers can be used for on the center’s website including autism, anxiety and attention deficit disorder, whereas FDA has only approved usage for limited conditions.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
A natural gas company has surrendered its permits to pump water from a western Pennsylvania creek in a move welcomed by environmentalists fearful of rising industrial demand for surface water and the growing threat of climate change.
PennEnergy Resources asked the state’s Department of Environmental Protection in April to rescind its permits for 1.5 million gallons a day from the Big Sewickley Creek in Beaver County near Pittsburgh, saying the creek would not likely provide enough water for eight horizontal wells it plans nearby.
Years earlier, the company had requested to drain 3 million gallons a day from the main-stem creek and a million gallons from its north fork. DEP denied the application, citing risks to a fish, the southern redbelly dace, that the state classifies as threatened. The company modified its application, and in January 2024, the agency issued permits for a withdrawal of 1.5 million gallons a day.
But PennEnergy, a Pittsburgh-based independent oil and gas company, no longer wants the smaller amount, saying that changes in the stream flow would not provide enough water as required in its permits.
“We noted naturally occurring alterations of the stream-bed conditions making it unlikely that our approved withdrawal location would be viable to meet bypass flow conditions as specified in the permit ahead of the need for our well-development operations,” said Amanda Peterson, a PennEnergy spokeswoman.
Peterson declined to say if the company had found a new source of water. But she noted that each well uses between 9 and 18 million gallons for hydraulic fracturing operations, about two-thirds of which is recycled. She said the request to rescind the permits was a voluntary action and not a response to public pressure or instruction from regulators.
Across the country, the average hydraulically fracked gas or oil well uses about 4 million gallons of water, or about as much as New York City uses every six minutes, according to the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group. Opponents of fracking say water from surface sources such as creeks are the wrong use of a common and natural resource by a for-profit company.
Critics had urged PennEnergy to withdraw water from the nearby Ohio River or another larger waterway, not the Big Sewickley Creek. But the company first rejected that option, saying the creek fit its policy of using a withdrawal site as close as possible to its gas well pad, cutting truck traffic.

Advocates for the creek welcomed the company’s decision as a victory for the local environment.
“Big Sewickley Creek does not have sufficient flow, and other water sources should have been more thoroughly considered, especially prior to the clearing of mature forest, and the construction of a gravel pad in the creek’s most beloved recreational area,” Katie Stanley, president of the Big Sewickley Creek Watershed Association, said in a statement.
There’s no evidence that the permit surrender reflected public opposition to the water-withdrawal plan, said the association’s treasurer, Rose Reilly. But volunteers had planned to monitor stream flow and told PennEnergy that it would be held accountable to its permit limits. “This may have weighed into their decision to rescind the permits,” Reilly said.
PennEnergy may not have fully grasped the creek’s flow and its back channels, she said. A significant portion of the stream bypasses the site in Beaver County where the water would have been withdrawn, Reilly said. After heavy rains early this year, some 70 percent of the stream flow bypassed the intake site, she said.
If the withdrawal had gone ahead, Reilly said, it would have reduced the creek’s water quality and the area’s water table, harming the habitat it offers, including for southern redbelly dace.
DEP spokesman Brandon Glass confirmed that PennEnergy voluntarily asked the agency to withdraw the permits. He said oil and gas companies “occasionally” opt out of permits.
PennEnergy’s conclusion that Big Sewickley Creek would not be a reliable water source could be followed by companies inside and outside the fracking industry as climate change upends rainfall patterns, predicted Emma Bast, a staff attorney at PennFuture, an environmental nonprofit.

Industrial water users, including fast-growing data centers, may feel less confident about water from surface sources after the drought of 2024. Heavy rains in the spring of 2025 have only added to climate unpredictability, Bast said.
“With climate change, and this variability increasing, I would not be surprised to see something like this happening more often,” she said.
Heather Hulton VanTassel, executive director of Three Rivers Waterkeeper, a nonprofit that advocates for water quality in the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers and their watersheds in the Pittsburgh region, said many fracking companies withdraw water from nearby creeks but the proposed take by PennEnergy from Big Sewickley Creek was unusually large.
VanTassel predicted fracking in southwestern Pennsylvania will deplete waterways as companies vie for naturally flowing water and recycle less of it. “It’s a matter of time,” she said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/big-sewickley-creek-INSIDE-CLIMATE-NEWS-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

(Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)A federal magistrate judge has ruled that the state of Alaska did not violate the U.S. Constitution when it acted to limit intoxicating hemp products in 2023.
In an order published May 23, Magistrate Judge Kyle Reardon granted summary judgment in favor of the state and against the Alaska Industrial Hemp Association, which sued two years ago in an attempt to overturn regulations imposed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.
The court order means intoxicating hemp products, common in many other states, will remain illegal in Alaska unless sold through a licensed marijuana retailer. 
“It was rewarding to be part of the process developing the regulations, and I was happy when we successfully defended against the motion for a preliminary injunction in 2023,” said Assistant Attorney General Kevin Higgins, by email. Higgins represented the state in the case. 
“I’m not patting myself on the back too hard though,” he said. “The Division of Agriculture was motivated by public safety concerns when it took measured action to regulate an emerging industry. This was an easy case to make, which is probably why the plaintiffs didn’t file an opposition to the motion for summary judgment.”
An attorney representing the plaintiff did not answer a request for comment on Wednesday.
Alaska legalized the sale and use of marijuana for recreational purposes in 2014. The state subsequently created a tightly regulated market in which only licensed businesses may grow, process and sell marijuana.
Under a 2018 federal law and a state law enacted in 2021, cannabis plants that contain less than 0.3% THC — a common psychoactive chemical — were considered hemp, not the more tightly regulated marijuana. 
Even though those hemp products contain only small amounts of psychoactive chemicals, they could be extracted, processed and turned into intoxicating products that were available at convenience stores, gas stations and other stores not restricted by the state’s marijuana regulator.
While hemp products are federally legal, marijuana remains federally prohibited, and social media companies frequently restrict marijuana advertising, giving an advantage to the hemp market.
Marijuana retailers urged action, and a task force organized by Gov. Mike Dunleavy recommended that the state enact regulations to limit intoxicating hemp products.
The Alaska Division of Agriculture enacted those in 2023, leading to the lawsuit that was resolved this month.
Plaintiffs had argued that the division’s regulations violate the constitution’s supremacy clause, violate the dormant commerce clause, constitute a regulatory taking and are void for vagueness.
In each case, Reardon ruled against the plaintiffs and in favor of the state.
Early in the legal dispute, Reardon rejected a request for a preliminary injunction, allowing the state to enforce its regulations as the case progressed. 
Already this year, enforcement officers from the Division of Agriculture and Alaska Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office have seized products from three businesses in Anchorage and one in Fairbanks. 
Trevor Haynes, president of the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association and manager of a Fairbanks marijuana business, said that while the association has issues with the way the state is regulating hemp, it’s good that the state’s regulations for intoxicating hemp products were preserved in court.
“That is one way to stop the development of a gray area where people will … basically sell marijuana under the guise of hemp,” he said.
He was critical of the state’s decision to require hemp retailers to sell products that contain absolutely no psychoactive substances. Removing all traces requires costly, specialized equipment and generally isn’t economically feasible for small-scale Alaska businesses.
“I have a business that’s purely a hemp business and so I understand it from both sides. It’s unfortunate, and there might be a better solution, but (the regulations are) certainly a way to ensure that there’s no gray area where intoxicating hemp, aka marijuana under another name, can be produced in the state and sold in the state.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hemp-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

(Photo by Getty Images)As a U.S. Army veteran who served five combat deployments, I’ve seen firsthand the physical and psychological scars that many of my fellow service members carry with them after returning home. 
I’ve walked alongside soldiers battling PTSD, chronic pain, anxiety and the long-term effects of traumatic brain injuries. These are not just war wounds — they are life-altering burdens that often go unseen and untreated. 
In the years since I returned home, I’ve come to see that the path to healing doesn’t always come easily. And for many veterans, traditional treatments aren’t effective, leading us to turn to alternative treatments like cannabis.
I say this not as an outsider or a casual observer, but as a patient, an advocate and a former member of the Minnesota Cannabis Advisory Council. I’ve had countless conversations with fellow veterans and civilians alike who have found relief through cannabis when traditional medicine failed them. I’ve seen its power, not as a miracle drug, but as a legitimate and effective treatment for various conditions.
That’s why I strongly support the push to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act. The work that started during the Biden administration on this issue appears to have stalled out, and it needs a jumpstart. 
Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III would be more than a symbolic gesture. It would represent a tangible, meaningful shift in how we treat cannabis and those who rely on it. It would open the door to comprehensive clinical research that has long been stifled under federal restrictions. Researchers and medical professionals would finally be able to conduct studies with the rigor and scope this issue demands, helping us better understand the full spectrum of cannabis’s therapeutic potential.
And let’s be clear: Support for this change is not partisan. In fact, President Donald Trump has expressed support for rescheduling cannabis, recognizing the benefits of modernizing our drug laws. When leaders from across the political spectrum — conservatives, libertarians, progressives and independents — are aligned on an issue, it tells us something: This isn’t a radical idea. It’s a reasonable one.
Despite this growing body of evidence, our federal government still classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug, putting it on par with heroin and declaring it to have “no accepted medical use” and a “high potential for abuse.” 
Veterans, perhaps more than any other group, understand the consequences of bureaucratic inertia. We’ve watched the Veterans Affairs system struggle to keep up with the growing mental health crisis in our community. We’ve watched our brothers- and sisters-in-arms cycle through prescriptions, such as opioids, antidepressants and sleeping pills, many of which come with debilitating side effects and limited long-term effectiveness. 
Cannabis has been a lifeline for many of us. And the irony is, in states where medical cannabis is legal, veterans often still face stigma from health care providers and risks to their federal benefits if they choose to use it. Why? Because cannabis remains stigmatized by outdated federal laws that ignore decades of research and real-world experience.
Reclassifying cannabis would legitimize it in the eyes of our health care system. It would allow providers, especially those within the VA, to have honest conversations with patients about medical cannabis as an option. It would remove the concern that many veterans face when they bring up cannabis with their doctors, fearing judgment or repercussions.
We can’t talk about supporting veterans and then ignore a reform such as this one that could improve our lives. We can’t claim to respect our service members while denying us access to a medicine that helps us live with dignity and purpose. We served our country with honor. We did our duty. Now we are simply asking our government to do theirs.

(Photo by Getty Images)Recently released federal data shows that the number of children and youth in foster care nationwide dropped by 6.9% in 2023. 
Here in Minnesota, that might sound like good news at first glance. Fewer youth in care might suggest progress — a sign that our systems are getting better at supporting families and preventing unnecessary removals.
But for those of us who have lived through foster care, and who organize every day with young people navigating it now, the story is more complex.
At Foster Advocates, we are proud to be the only organization in Minnesota led by and for people with foster care experience — whom we call Fosters. We believe in a future where all young people, no matter how they enter the system, are met with safety, belonging and opportunity. Unfortunately, that future is still out of reach for most.
Despite this recent drop in the number of youth in care, the outcomes for those who remain paint a grim picture. In Minnesota, more than half of Fosters experience homelessness by age 24, according to Wilder Research. And according to the National Foster Youth Institute, over 90% of Fosters do not have even $500 in savings. Just 37% graduate high school on time in Minnesota.

That’s why we launched what we call the Minnesota Promise: a statewide campaign to ask Fosters directly what real justice and support would look like. 
Over the past two years, we’ve hosted listening sessions with over 120 Fosters representing more than 50 counties. What they told us was clear: They want to be seen, heard and empowered; not simply managed by systems that too often ignore their needs and voices.
Through our community organizing work, Fosters shared that, for many, it was the first time they had been in a room with others who shared their experience — without feeling ashamed or needing to hide it. They were able to have honest, difficult conversations with people who understood them immediately and without judgment.
The Minnesota Promise is not a checklist of reforms. It is a vision for transformation, one rooted in healing, culture and the leadership of those most impacted. It demands that we stop measuring progress by the number of kids in care and start measuring it by the outcomes we create for them. Are they housed? Are they connected to community? Are they thriving?
A numerical decline in foster care placements is not a promise kept. It could reflect positive shifts in prevention and family support, or it could mask deeper issues, such as youth aging out without support, or families discouraged from engaging with systems that historically have not served them well.
If we want to turn this moment into real momentum, we must do more than celebrate numbers. We must invest in Foster-informed services and wellness, peer-led leadership, and system redesign led by Fosters themselves.
Minnesota has the opportunity to lead the nation, not just in reducing the number of children in care, but in building a world where they no longer fall through the cracks once they leave. A smaller system does not mean a better one — unless we change the experience of those still inside it.
The question now is not just how many children are in foster care. It’s whether, collectively as Minnesotans, we’re finally ready to keep our promise to them.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2204197688-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

(Courtesy of Barry Dunn)EDITOR’S NOTE: This commentary is adapted from a speech to the 2025 Big Sioux Stewardship Summit in Sioux Falls.
My grandfather, Claude Lamoureaux, was a cowboy and an Indian. For a boy growing up in the 1950s and ’60s, that was just about the coolest thing ever. 
He and my grandmother, Hattie, ranched south of Mission on the Rosebud Reservation. My boyhood memories are of driving across the ranch in a two-wheel-drive, green Chevy pickup with my grandfather, checking the cattle and the windmills and making sure all the gates were closed and the fences were tight. Many times we rode horses, and from early on I saddled my own.

Grandpa was never very talkative, but I peppered him with questions to the point of annoyance, and I learned by some sharp looks that I needed to be quiet. I have no memory of him tucking me into bed or telling me he loved me or playing games. That was Grandma’s job. But on horseback, in his truck, around the supper table, he taught me many lessons, most of which I understand better today. 
I graduated from high school at Christmastime and immediately went to the ranch working full time. Sadly, my grandma died soon after, and I found myself alone with Grandpa Claude. He was grieving, and I was trying to grow up, so it was a poignant time for both of us.
By then, his brown skin had darkened even more and he had wrinkles from a hard life defined by scarcity. He wasn’t a tall man, but he was still rugged and straight, and his love for the land was obvious. 
He was a member of the Sicangu Lakota. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation south of what is now Winner, into extreme poverty and just two years after the Wounded Knee Massacre on the Pine Ridge Reservation, a few miles to the west. 
As a teenager, Grandpa rode in the last open range roundups in the Dakotas, clearing the reservations of Texas cattle to open the way for homesteaders. He described the landscape back then as beautiful, endless grassland, except for an occasional cottonwood grove, which was a sign of water and perhaps some shelter.
Right after World War II, he bought a place called the Antelope Ranch. He used his Indian preference status and was very entrepreneurial, buying abandoned homesteads for dollars an acre. He put together 12,500 contiguous acres and renamed it the L7 Ranch, after his brand. He received that brand from his father, and I still have it.
Most ranchers talk about their prize cattle and their best horses, and Grandpa was very proud of his livestock. He ran a band of mares with a stallion. But his true love was for the land.

During the homestead era, farmers had plowed up nearly every flat acre in Todd County they could find. When they failed during the Dust Bowl, they left the land abandoned, scarred and unproductive. Grandpa used to say that weeds were Mother Nature’s way of covering her nakedness. He found the old fields that he bought covered with weeds and annual grasses.
Without understanding the modern concepts of ecological succession, he called those fields “go back” — meaning to him that they were trying to go back to their native condition. As I reflect on that, I’m left wondering where that understanding of the power of succession, of Mother Nature to reclaim herself, came from.
He also knew that planting grasses would hurry the healing, and he worked with the Soil Conservation Service, which is now the Natural Resources Conservation Service. He planted hundreds of acres of scarred and blowing land back to introduced and native grasses, way back in the 1940s and ’50s.
He planted alfalfa with cool-season grasses because he knew it was a natural fertilizer for hay ground, like he knew that purple prairie clover was a natural legume in grasslands. He knew the pastures needed to be properly stocked, so he was careful to put just the right number of cattle in each one.
Beavers had been eliminated from the landscape a century earlier by fur trappers — some of them my ancestors — and he understood that by building a series of small dams on Antelope Creek, he could raise the water table of the entire valley, increase its productivity and provide water for livestock and wildlife. An interesting phenomenon occurred after that: The beavers came back.
My grandpa didn’t use fancy words when he talked about conservation and stewardship. He was pragmatic, blunt, usually quiet. He didn’t mention his Lakota heritage as part of his values, but upon reflection, they were on clear display. His principles and practices are timeless and elegant. He loved the treeless prairie, and taught me to love it.
One year, he won a small award from the Todd County Conservation District. He was so proud of it, and I was proud of him. My lifetime commitment to conservation was inspired by my grandfather and then solidified by education at South Dakota State University.

From earning my undergraduate degree in biological sciences way back in 1975 to securing a master’s and then a doctorate, I’ve had many opportunities to learn more about the ecology of our great state and the grassland biome that runs from Canada all the way to northern Mexico, and from the Rockies to the Mississippi River.
Many years after that eventful spring and summer following my grandma’s death, I saw a quote by the famous conservationist Aldo Leopold that reminds me of my grandfather. Leopold said, “The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, water, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.”
In short, a land ethic changes the role of homo sapiens from conqueror of the land community to a plain member and citizen of it. It implies a respect for the fellow members of the community. 
Leopold also said, “Teach the student to see the land, understand what he sees, and enjoy what he understands.” In those terms, my grandfather was a successful teacher. 
He was an old man when he built dams, planted grass and stocked his pastures. He didn’t live much longer than my grandma, because he couldn’t live without her. He wasn’t around to see or personally benefit from most of the conservation work that he did. He didn’t have to take the responsibility to leave the land better than when he found it, but I am certain he believed he did. His conservation work and land stewardship were an expression of his values and ethics.
It inspired me then and still does today. I clearly remember the moment when Grandpa’s land ethic clicked with me. It was 1971, during that pivotal time I spent with Grandpa after Grandma died.
It was a spring morning following some really good rains, which aren’t frequent in Todd County. It was a picture-perfect scene, something you’d expect to see in a Western movie. I was by myself, atop a horse, checking fences in an area I had ridden a hundred times before. And there it hit me, as vividly as Dorothy’s world went from black and white to color when she landed in the Land of Oz. 
We all know how South Dakota’s prairie can be that earthy amber color, a warm and sun-kissed reddish brown with golden undertones. But not that morning. Grandpa Claude’s hillsides were lit up. Wildflowers were everywhere in response to those infrequent rains, and it was amazing. But the experience was much deeper than that.

When I looked across the great expanse before me, I could see the difference in land ethics based upon land ownership. Grandpa Claude’s hills were a quilt of blossoms stitched together by sun, wind and open sky. I didn’t even need the fences to mark the boundaries.
The lack of conservation methods and stewardship and a land ethic contrasted drastically before me. The adjacent lands next to Grandpa’s pasture were being farmed for potatoes in Todd County, believe it or not. They looked like drouth-scabbed earth — patchy, uneven, gray, brown. They looked worn and diseased.
Beyond the beauty, there are important reasons why we all need those flower-covered hills. The journal Science recently reported that butterfly populations in the United States are dropping dramatically. In conservation terms, butterflies are what is known as a key species. The relative health of their population is an excellent indicator of the health of the ecosystem in which they live, and the health of all insects. 
Conservation, another science journal, reports that 40% of all insect species in America are on a dramatic decline. Insects help pollinate crops, and they’re on the food chain for birds and other animals. They’re critically important in the loop that Leopold described, because it’s an interconnected world. Conservation ethics — or land ethics, as Leopold called them — are an important link in life’s fragile chain, whether we live in cities or in rural settings.
As I mentioned, Grandpa wasn’t much for talking, but his actions and results spoke volumes. His land ethic instilled in me a love and respect for every blade of grass, every butterfly that flutters by, and even a bird’s nest where we don’t want it. He’s the reason I brush worms back into the dirt from the sidewalk, why I pick up litter, why I recycle everything I possibly can. 
My question for you today is, will our grandchildren or great-grandchildren have the same opportunities?
Will they experience the beauty of a swallowtail butterfly in its natural environment, or just view them in a museum of natural history or butterfly house? Will they hear a meadowlark sing or marvel at a red-tailed hawk on the hunt flying low across the prairie? I’m concerned that they will not.










“Teach the student to see the land, understand what he sees, and enjoy what he understands.”

Over the last several decades, native grasslands in South Dakota and the entire grassland biome that I described earlier have dramatically declined in total acres, and with it biodiversity, whose value we can’t possibly measure. Fortunately, we know what to do. We know the basics of ecology. We know the importance of soil health. We know the principles of good range management. We know that with the right tillage systems, we wouldn’t have dust storms. We know that conservation pays. We know what to do. 
What we need is ethics. We need core values that reflect a love for the land on which we live and receive our sustenance. But can we muster the common sense and selfless spirit of our grandparents to do that? I’m not sure. 
I think we need to commit again, every day, individually and collectively, to have a land ethic that expresses our care and compassion and our responsibility for the land. 
I’ll leave you with another quote from Theodore Roosevelt, one of my favorite presidents.
“Here is your country,” he said. “Cherish these natural wonders, cherish the natural resources, cherish the history and romance as a sacred heritage, for your children and your children’s children.”

Stanford scientists have recently confirmed California’s first known infection of a highly transmissible COVID-19 variant, known as NB.1.8.1. Detected in the state as early as April 17, its symptoms do not appear to be any more severe than earlier strains so far, and because NB.1.8.1 is an Omicron variant, the latest vaccines should provide some immunity.
But NB.1.8.1 is more infectious: The strain has been spreading throughout Asia and Europe, and is responsible for the latest surge of infections in China. In addition to California, it has been reported in international visitors traveling through airports in Washington, New York and Virginia. Separate from airport travelers, the variant has also been reported in Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii.
Amid news of this latest strain, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it will limit COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to people ages 65 and older, and people who are at high risk for severe infections. In an article published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, FDA officials said that “the benefit of repeat dosing — particularly among low-risk persons … is uncertain.” 
Historically the vaccine has been available to almost all people ages 6 months and older, and the new policy means that the FDA is no longer recommending the vaccine to healthy children and pregnant women. The FDA is led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has had a history of spreading widely debunked anti-vaccination views.
The FDA’s rule change comes two months after the California Department of Public Health said that President Donald Trump’s administration terminated more than $700 million in public health grants related to COVID-19 response.
Though there is no longer a pandemic, infections do tend to spike during the summer, with California seeing some of its highest surges last summer. More than 101,000 Californians have died from COVID-19 and more than 1 million Americans have died — exceeding by a wide margin American service member casualties in every war combined.

Kicking Californians off Medi-Cal?

Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed reinstating a limit on assets for Medi-Cal enrollees. Critics are concerned doing so would keep thousands of low-income seniors and disabled people from having vital health coverage, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
California last year eliminated its cap on how much in assets a person could own to qualify for Medi-Cal. That led to an unanticipated number of people enrolling for Medical, according to the Newsom administration. 
So, amid multibillion-dollar budget deficits for both the state and Medi-cal, the governor wants to bring back an asset limit which was originally set in 1989: $2,000 for individuals 65 and older, as well as those with disabilities. Among other things, assets include life insurance, cash on hand, savings accounts and even owning some funeral plots.
Newsom said the proposal would save the state $94 million this year and $500 million the next. But those opposed say it would create a financial cliff for those about to turn 65, and that it’s nearly impossible to live with just $2,000 in assets in California — especially if you must pay costly medical expenses.

Housing prices contribute to transit woes

Public transit systems across California are facing a “fiscal cliff,” and there are a number of reasons why ridership is down: Aging transit infrastructure, more people are owning cars and a lack of robust, on-going investment from state and federal governments, to name a few.
But as CalMatters’ Ben Christopher explains, there is another, less obvious reason: California’s housing affordability crisis. 
In neighborhoods located in Los Angeles and Orange counties that have reliable buses and trains systems, transit ridership tended to decrease where rents were rising, according to a 2024 study by UCLA researchers. At South L.A. Chinatown, for example, average rents went up $379 and transit use fell by 21%. In a part of San Fernando Valley’s Pacoima, rent was up $305, ridership was down 28%. 
The findings suggest that gentrification — in addition to widening economic inequalities — displaces some residents who rely on transit systems. When they move to other neighborhoods where the transit system may not be as good, they are pushed further away from their jobs, leading to more driving, more traffic and more pollution.

,California,2025-05-29 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,"‘I’m really scared’: Elderly and disabled Californians with more than $2,000 could lose Medi-Cal",Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/05/medi-cal-assets-newsom-health-insurance/,Health advocates say the proposal to reinstate the Medi-Cal asset limit would keep people in poverty while Gov. Newsom says it's essential to cut rising costs.,"In summary
Health advocates say the proposal to reinstate the Medi-Cal asset limit would keep people in poverty while Gov. Newsom says it’s essential to cut rising costs.



Cynde Soto, a quadriplegic who requires around-the-clock care, has been on Medi-Cal for most of her life. Recently, she came into a modest inheritance, about $8,000, that has helped cover her daily expenses. But it also means that she would lose her state health insurance under a proposal from Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom has proposed restoring a $2,000 limit on an individual’s assets — including savings accounts and property other than a home and a car — and $3,000 for couples to qualify for Medi-Cal. Anyone 65 and older or disabled who exceeds that limit would be ineligible. Newsom also is proposing a cap on how much home care Medi-Cal enrollees like Soto could receive.
In unveiling the proposal, Newsom said that California has a “spending problem” and needs to make “difficult choices” to address the state’s $12 billion deficit, which he attributed in part to growing Medi-Cal costs. His proposal would save the state $94 million this budget year and more than $500 million the next year, according to the governor’s budget document.
But health advocates say that it’s almost impossible for someone to live with just $2,000 in assets in California. Rent often exceeds that amount, and medical expenses not covered by insurance quickly add up.
Advocates say Newsom’s proposal unfairly targets people with disabilities and the elderly — those who are most likely to need full-time care and have fixed incomes.
“It’s draconian — $2,000 is no safety net for people,” said Kim Selfon, an attorney with Bet Tzedek, a legal services organization in Los Angeles.

For Soto, a Medi-Cal limit on assets would mean she would either lose the caretakers who help her bathe and eat or have to spend all of the money except for $2,000. With the inheritance, Soto said she can afford repairs to her Long Beach condo and buy medical supplies that Medi-Cal doesn’t cover, such as bandages or nutritional drinks to supplement her diet.
“It’s not cheap being disabled,” Soto said. “I’m really scared. I cannot live without my help.”
When asset limits were lifted, Medi-Cal enrollment surged
Some lawmakers and disability advocates have argued against the asset limit for years. They say it forces people into poverty and hasn’t kept up with rising inflation and cost of living. 
Newsom agreed to raise the limit to $130,000 per person in 2022. Then in 2024, the limit was erased completely. Now Newsom wants to bring back the original limit of $2,000, an amount that was set in 1989. 
This would reinstate complex rules about wealth and property that kept thousands of seniors and disabled people from qualifying for Medi-Cal. Under those rules, an individual’s first home and car are exempt, but other properties count toward the $2,000 limit. The balance of a 401k or retirement account are exempt, although payouts are considered income. Life insurance, cash on hand and savings accounts also count towards the limit. Even certain types of funeral plots count. 
The test would apply only to people 65 and older as well as those with disabilities, which creates a financial cliff for those about to turn 65. Medicare, which many seniors use for health insurance, does not cover long-term care and requires some co-pays, so many people use Medi-Cal to supplement their Medicare benefits.
In a recent Assembly hearing, Newsom administration officials said when the limit was eliminated, far more people enrolled in Medi-Cal than anticipated, contributing to the state’s growing costs. Between 112,000 to 115,000 people enrolled compared to early estimates of just 40,000, said health care services director Michelle Baass.
Seniors make up a small portion of all Medi-Cal enrollees, but they’re about twice as expensive as the average enrollee because they use more medical care. The elimination of the asset test last year contributed to most of the senior enrollment growth and cost the state about $500 million more than expected, according to a report by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. 
Still, lawmakers during the hearing questioned the prudence of kicking seniors and people with disabilities off of the program and whether it would actually save money in the long run. 
Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a Democrat from Santa Clarita, said these groups would need more expensive care like nursing home stays or homeless services if the asset test were reinstated.
“This is going to lead to more homelessness of seniors and the disabled. That’s what’s going to happen, and that will cost our state money too,” Schiavo said.
Making it ‘more expensive to age in California‘
Al Sanderson, one of Selfon’s clients, says that’s exactly what would happen to him. The Redondo Beach resident broke his neck three years ago in a surfing accident that left him paralyzed.  
Sanderson said his monthly rent costs more than the asset limit. He has significant savings as a former high school physical education teacher and baseball coach that he uses to pay for utilities, transportation and things that his kids need now that he no longer works. 
If he got kicked off of Medi-Cal and lost his caretakers, Sanderson said he would lose his independence.
“How am I going to pay people to come help me? How am I supposed to survive and live? I’d have to go to a nursing home,” Sanderson said.
Without full-time home care, both Sanderson and Soto would most likely end up in nursing homes, a more expensive option that is covered by Medi-Cal. The state pays on average more than $114,000 per person each year for nursing home care, according to Justice in Aging, which pushed for the elimination of the asset test. In contrast, the average annual cost of in-home care is less than a quarter of that, $25,400 a year.
“How am I going to pay people to come help me? How am I supposed to survive and live? I’d have to go to a nursing home.”AL SANDERSON, REDONDO BEACH RESIDENT 
Kevin Prindiville, executive director of Justice in Aging, said Newsom’s proposal would “make it more expensive to age in California.”
California’s elimination of the asset test came under fire this month from congressional Republicans, who claimed that it allows the “wealthiest Californians” to get free health care. But lawyers with legal aid organizations that help people enroll in Medi-Cal say that’s not happening. 
Regardless of their assets, Medi-Cal enrollees still need to meet income limits, which are currently 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $1,800 per month, said Linda Nguy, a lobbyist with the Western Center on Law and Poverty. 
“Our clients are not millionaires,” Nguy said. “We’re talking about people with very low incomes who aren’t able to access the health care services that they need.”

Ronald Dallatorre, 58, enrolled in Medi-Cal just two months ago. He had been looking forward to getting caretakers to help him at his Compton home so that his wife could take a break. 
Dallatorre got sick with COVID-19 in April 2020. He spent four weeks on a ventilator and almost a year in a hospital. Now the former heavy duty mechanic has Guillan-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disease that attacks the nervous system, causing muscle weakness and numbness.
Dallatorre uses a wheelchair and can’t move his hands. His wife quit her job with L.A. Unified School District to take care of him full-time. The Dallatorres also own a second home that a close family friend lives in, rent-free. Under the proposed budget, Dallatorre would be ineligible for Medi-Cal because of this property.
“Our clients are not millionaires. We’re talking about people with very low incomes who aren’t able to access the health care services that they need.”LINDA NGUY, WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY 
If he is kicked off Medi-Cal because of the asset test, Dallatorre said his medical costs would still be covered through his wife’s insurance, but they can’t afford caretakers. His wife would have to continue as his full-time support.
“I worked 40 years of my life never receiving help, always paying taxes. I was glad to do it because I thought maybe when I need it, somebody will be able to help me,” Dallatorre said. “I didn’t know how stupid the system is.”

Across Los Angeles, rent hikes have led to fewer bus and train riders in an example of how California’s housing crisis is also making its transit crisis harder to solve.


The northern tip of the Vermont Square neighborhood in South Los Angeles gentrified in many of the usual ways over the last decade. 
Median incomes shot up. The neighborhood’s share of Black residents declined. On the list of fastest growing home prices across the region, Vermont Square cracked the top ten. Along Western Avenue, new apartment buildings popped up as visible markers of change.
But there is a less obvious, if no less profound, marker: Fewer people began riding the bus. 
Between 2012 and 2017, public transit ridership fell in this Census designated tract — a roughly half-square mile neighborhood spanning Western — by 24%. In that same period, the neighborhood-wide rent increased by an average of $468 per month.  
That, according to UCLA researchers, is probably not a coincidence. A study published late last year compared changes in transit ridership numbers to rental market trends in neighborhoods across Los Angeles and Orange counties. It found that in neighborhoods well-served by buses and trains, transit ridership tended to fall in places where the rents were rising. 
At the south end of Chinatown, average rents went up $379 and transit use fell by 21%. In a sliver of Pacoima in the San Fernando Valley, rent was up $305, ridership was down 28%. Across the region, a neighborhood-wide rental hike of an extra $230 per month predicted a 22% decline in bus and train boardings. 
The most likely explanation, according to the researchers, is that as dense urban neighborhoods grow more costly, lower- and moderate-income renters, the very people most likely to ride the bus, are pushed out and replaced by a more affluent set who, on the whole, tend to favor getting around by car.
The findings suggest gentrification isn’t just bad for residents displaced by rising rents and scarce affordable units: It’s also bad for the transit systems those displaced residents rely upon.
Twin crises: Housing and transit
California’s public bus and rail agencies are in a decade-long slump. For that, there’s plenty of blame to go around. 
COVID-19 steered commuters away from crowded buses and train cars and ridership numbers have yet to fully recover. Federal rescue funding passed by Congress in 2020 and 2021 propped up these systems for a time but has now mostly dried up. Inflation, supply chain snags and now tariffs have made the cost of maintaining aging, legacy infrastructure even costlier. Even before the pandemic-era tumult, the advent of rideshare apps and a steady nationwide rise in car ownership rates resulted in a slow and steady decline of transit ridership.
The UCLA study points to yet another culprit behind the state’s public transit woes: California’s housing affordability crisis. 
“The basic premise of the paper is, ‘Can rising rents help explain why you’re losing transit ridership?’ And it seems to be that they can, because they reduce the likelihood that very high transit riders will live near transit stops,” said urban planning professor Michael Manville, lead author of the paper.
Manville and his fellow researchers weren’t able to track where displaced transit riders wound up. But given the relatively few number of transit-friendly neighborhoods in the Los Angeles and Orange County metro area, it’s likely most settled in neighborhoods with fewer public transportation options. Some may have felt compelled to lease or buy a car, at considerable expense to their own finances and to the environment. For others, unwilling or unable to incur that expense, being priced out of a neighborhood with steady bus and rail service might simply mean having fewer travel options. 
That latter outcome might be more likely these days. The study uses data collected before the pandemic. Now, with higher interest rates, higher ride-share costs and higher auto prices — which could sail higher still if high tariffs remain in place — “you might actually see people not being able to switch to driving as much,” said Manville. Instead, displaced renters may simply be forced to move and rely on “transit in neighborhoods where the transit isn’t as good.” 
Fewer transportation options have been found to put a person at risk of higher unemployment, poorer health and more pronounced social isolation.
The findings in and around the L.A. Basin are consistent with a general trend across California and North America, in which higher rents and prices push lower income residents further and further out of many dense, urban job centers. This “suburbanization of poverty” has changed who has access to public transit in cities as different and far apart as Toronto, Canada and Durham, North Carolina.
The desperate unaffordability of housing in California has a way of making virtually every other statewide problem worse. Higher rents swell the state’s population of homeless. Higher home prices widen economic inequality and put wealth accumulation out of reach for millions. Shortages of housing in urban cores push people further away from their jobs, snarling traffic and pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. 
The story of Vermont Square, and hundreds of other similar neighborhoods across the region, shows that California’s housing crisis is also making its transit crisis harder to solve.
Will California beef up housing near transit?
That double-whammy is top of mind for many legislators in Sacramento this year. San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat and prominent author of bills to boost housing production and support public transit agencies, is pushing legislation this year that is supposed to do both. Senate Bill 79 would allow for dense apartment construction around major public transit stops, including on land owned by transit agencies.
“If we’re going to make big public investments in public transportation, which of course I support and I know many of us support, we need to make sure that people can actually live near those stations and ride on those trains or those high-quality bus lines,” Wiener said at a legislative hearing late last month. 
The bill has survived three committee hearings, but only barely, overcoming the opposition of two committee chairs. Supported by advocates for denser housing development and public transportation, it is fiercely opposed by construction labor unions, an array of city governments, anti-density activists and some advocates who argue the state should prioritize new housing set aside for low-income residents over market rate development. 
The committee chairs who oppose the bill said they support more housing construction but think legislation like Wiener’s should come with more terms and conditions for private developers. 
In an opposition letter written to a Senate committee last month, a coalition of anti-poverty and environmental justice groups led by the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation wrote that California law should “ensure that the existing low-income households and people of color who disproportionately use transit daily benefit from transit-oriented development.” 
By allowing for more dense housing around transit stops without explicit affordability requirements the bill “risks accelerating displacement of these core transit users,” the letter reads. 
The bill now awaits a vote before the entire Senate. The vote is expected next week. 
The debate represents a broader rift within the California Democratic Party between those who believe the best way to alleviate gentrification is to build additional housing to accommodate an influx of new, higher earning residents and those who see market-rate development as, at best, a poor substitute for affordable housing and, at worst, something that makes the problem worse.
Manville said he has not been following the legislative debate closely, but argued that building more housing near transit stops is likely to boost ridership in two ways.
First, he said, incoming residents will be more likely to take the bus or train. Higher income gentrifiers may not ride transit as much as the lower income residents, but at least from a pollution and climate perspective, “one reduced trip by a high-income person eliminates so many more miles of driving than a trip by a low-income person, because rich people drive more.”
Second, and more importantly, building more apartment units diverts some of the feverish competition for existing units and eases pressure on rents. Slowing rent hikes will make it “easier for lower income people to stay in that neighborhood and continue to ride,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/051019_Light-Rail-Train_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081
,California,2025-05-29 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Angelenos agree MacArthur Park needs help. The reliance on police is where they differ,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/macarthur-park-strategy-los-angeles/,"Mayor Karen Bass and the LAPD represent one approach to the MacArthur Park restoration effort. But as a raft of new issues emerge, activists and other leaders are pointing to strategies that address more fundamental issues.","The residents, business owners, unhoused people, commuters and passersby in the area around Los Angeles’ MacArthur Park have some things in common: They benefit from the community being clean, and they all value their safety.
But that consensus papers over some significant differences about how to achieve those goals. As L.A. City Hall focuses time and resources on reviving MacArthur Park, some of those differences are surfacing and raising questions about whether Mayor Karen Bass and those around her are on the right track.
For the park and its surrounding neighborhood, the city’s campaign to clean and secure this area is urgent. Once a jewel of this crowded, vibrant, bustling immigrant community, MacArthur Park has fallen into decay, overwhelmed by the crises that afflict Los Angeles and so many other cities: drugs, homelessness, crime, blight. The result has been an alarming downward spiral, driving out families and turning the park into a drug market, with all its attendant violence.
Writ large, the struggle for the park is even larger. If Los Angeles cannot reclaim this piece of ground, cannot bring safety and community back through the city’s mix of enforcement and compassion, then those remedies may have lost their power, and sterner measures may be required for communities to live in peace. 
In that sense, the debate is about competing views of government, either as a tool for betterment or one of enforcement.
That’s what makes this area not just important for those who live here but also for other California cities taking note of this example. And with that in mind, the struggle already is showing signs of discord.
Bass and the Los Angeles Police Department represent one approach to this crisis. Early this year, the LAPD and other city agencies swooped into the corridor along the eastern edge of the park, displacing illegal street vendors whose merchandise often included stolen goods or drugs. To keep those vendors from returning as soon as the police departed, the city erected chain link fences that remain in place today, blocking off large sections of sidewalk.
The intervention worked. Violent crime in the neighborhood dropped significantly. Local business owners saw hope. City leaders took a victory lap.
But a new raft of issues emerged. Drug overdoses actually increased because users were forced to seek out new supply and were unfamiliar with new dosages, according to overdose response teams. 

Moreover, the fenced-in areas of the sidewalks are an eyesore, and maintaining them is a Sisyphean enterprise. People toss their trash into the enclosures, and they fill up with garbage. Cleanup crews valiantly do their best, arriving every morning to clean the sidewalks and sweep the areas. The enclosures fill up again overnight and the work repeats. 
If Bass and the LAPD represent one type of response, activists and neighborhood leaders propose another. To them, this is not a crisis for police to solve but a breakdown of social policy. Only in Los Angeles would Bass, a liberal Democrat, be considered a moderate, but in terms of the politics around MacArthur Park, the pressure comes from the mayor’s left.
Going beyond the ‘fallback solution’
On a recent afternoon, three members of the area’s neighborhood council sat on a picnic bench near a western entrance to the park and took stock of the work. 
There were a few kids with their moms on the playground, but the hillside near it was dotted with sleeping men. One man lit up a foil container and then nodded off. More stared vacantly, strewn across the grass. A traffic officer nearby moved cars along and ignored the drug use less than 50 feet away.

The neighborhood council members are young, thoughtful and earnest. They live in the area, and they are devoting much time and energy to their community. To them, a policing solution is doomed to fail.
“They’re just responding to crime,” said Mireya Valencia, who works for a nonprofit and has lived in the area for four years. “They’re not preventing it.”
Grace Bryant agreed. “We’re asking the police force to do too much,” she said. As she spoke, a police helicopter circled above, forcing her to raise her voice. “They’re the fallback solution to everything.”
The problem with that, they and fellow-council member Gabriel Owens-Flores argued, is that police can only do so much, that law enforcement solutions are more likely to move a problem along — the problems of MacArthur Park, in that view, are just those of the city’s Skid Row, having been pushed to the west from Downtown — than to address it at a fundamental level.
To these activists, the root causes of trouble in MacArthur Park are not street vendors or even the drugs or merchandise that some were selling. The core issues are housing and employment, both under stress in this city of the very rich and very poor.
There are measures that can help those problems. Eviction protections, for instance, can help keep people in homes, easing the pressure on homelessness; legislatively ordered rent freezes can bring stability to neighborhoods; city inspections can ensure safety in housing. In the neighborhoods around the park, which are some of the most densely populated in America, those and other solutions could bring some peace and stability.
But they come at a price. Many landlords already are feeling pressure as costs, such as insurance, utilities and taxes, rise. Add tariffs and the economic chaos that has become a hallmark of the Trump administration, and how are they to survive? 
Buffeted by rising costs and demanding tenants, landlords often look to maintain their buildings at the lowest possible level, nudging out tenants so they can tear the buildings down and replace them with higher-yield replacements. That’s bad for renters and disruptive to communities.
Those are not problems that LAPD foot patrols or community policing can do anything about. Yes, the LAPD can put up fences and chase off vendors, but the fences fill up with trash, and the crime just moves a few blocks away.
The most basic tension between those who turn to law enforcement and those who see solutions elsewhere, however, is this: Police are quick to respond, but don’t stay long; housing and employment plans may yield long-term results, but they aren’t quick. You can’t call 911 and get housing, and you can’t get police to solve chronic employment shortages.
L.A. City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez stands in the middle of all of this. She’s often critical of over-reliance on police, and she’s among the council members most happy to see the LAPD reduced in size and stature, an easy argument to make in a year when the city’s finances are tight anyway. For her, success in MacArthur Park is measured not in crime statistics but in overall community health. Winning, she says, will be when “every stakeholder can thrive.”
And yet, that can’t be done without some police involvement, she concedes. “There is,” she said, “a place for law enforcement.”
So the work at the park continues. The vendors are gone, but the police helicopters remain busy.

MGM Resorts International is advertising an offshore casino and sports betting site that is off limits to gamblers in the United States — a move that could prompt more regulatory headaches for the company, which recently paid $16 million to state and federal authorities for violating anti-money laundering laws. 
The logo for Monkey Tilt, an offshore casino and betting site, appears on an Aria poker table in an episode of PokerGo, a program that is sometimes produced at Aria. Among the gamblers at the table is Samer (Sam) Mohammed Kiki Jr., founder and CEO of Monkey Tilt. He did not respond to numerous requests for comment. 
The revelation puts MGM in the awkward position of advertising for an illegal competitor of its BetMGM site. MGM general counsel John McManus did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unknown whether MGM received compensation for the logo’s placement on the poker felt. 
Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairman Kirk Hendrick said via email that Nevada gaming regulation does “not specifically address what types of advertising are allowed by those approved to participate in Nevada’s gaming industry,” but noted regulations provide “guidance regarding types of advertising that may be determined as an unsuitable method of operation…” 
Under Nevada gaming law, licensees may be subject to disciplinary action for “failure to conduct advertising and public relations activities in accordance with decency, dignity, good taste, honesty and inoffensiveness, including, but not limited to, advertising that is false or materially misleading.”  
Hendrick declined to address Aria’s Monkey Tilt ad specifically, but said “the Nevada Gaming Control Board is concerned whenever issues relate to unlicensed gaming.”
“The PokerGO Studio at the ARIA Resort & Casino is your destination to participate and watch the biggest poker tournaments and cash games as seen on PokerGO,” says the PokerGO Facebook page. 
“What you’re talking about sounds more sloppy than anything that would require a regulator to get involved,” says Alan Feldman, director of Strategic Initiatives for UNLV’s International Gaming Institute and formerly MGM’s longtime corporate spokesman. “If it was an explicit endorsement, it  would require a formal approval. If it amounted to an implicit endorsement, it probably should have been approved.”
Kiki, a Las Vegas resident, is a former employee of MGM and Caesars Entertainment. His Instagram account features images of a villa at the Mansions at MGM Grand, an accommodation reserved for high rollers. A video shows Kiki gambling at Fontainebleau.  
Like a growing number of offshore sites, Monkey Tilt accepts only cryptocurrency, which is often used by offshore platforms to evade tracking by law enforcement. Prospective gamblers in the U.S. who attempt to register to gamble on Monkey Tilt are directed to monkeytilt.us, which is billed as a “social casino.” However, the site is inoperable. 
Americans bet more than $510 billion a year with illegal and unregulated operators, according to a report from the American Gaming Association, at an annual cost of $44.2 billion in revenue to legal operators. The AGA says 55% of sports bettors who placed illegal bets thought they were gambling legally.
Through the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), gamblers in the U.S. can circumvent the law and evade detection by masking their internet protocol (IP) address, which is used to identify location. 
“Having a logo for an offshore site on an MGM event gives the impression that the MGM is endorsing this site,” says former casino executive and California Gambling Control Commission member Richard Schuetz. “It is totally inappropriate and contrary to the goals of Nevada’s model of regulated gaming.” 
A bettor who views an ad for a gambling site on the poker table of a licensed Las Vegas resort “would absolutely have a reasonable expectation to believe” the site is legitimate, says Trey Delap, executive director of the Nevada Council on Problem Gambling. 
According to the AGA, illegal gambling operations don’t invest in responsible gambling programs, fail to protect minors via age verification, take no steps to prevent money laundering, and don’t guarantee fair payouts. 
“Unlike legal operators, illegal operators also don’t pay a dime in taxes, robbing state and local governments of more than $13 billion in tax revenue each year,” says the AGA. 
Feds fold?
State gambling regulators, including Hendrick, and the AGA have asked the federal government to crack down on offshore betting sites.
“Offshore operators who offer their products into these highly-regulated state jurisdictions are doing so in contravention of not only state laws, but federal law,” says a 2023 letter to then-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland signed by top regulators in New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, Mississippi, and Louisiana, in addition to Nevada. 
Federal law contains provisions for holding offshore sites accountable, such as the Wire Act of 1961, which prohibits the use of wire communication to transmit bets on sporting events across state or national borders, and the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), which makes it illegal for offshore sites to knowingly accept payment for unregulated gambling. 
Jurisdictional challenges, international laws, encryption methods, as well as the expense of global prosecutions, render such efforts rare.   
A 2022 opinion piece in Legal Sports Report on the AGA’s letter to Garland suggests the Department of Justice, “like many law enforcement agencies, focuses much of its attention and resources on particular areas. To the extent that illicit gambling might overlap with any of the areas of interest that the Justice Department has its eye on, one can bet that those operators will be a priority.”
President Donald Trump’s DOJ has its eye almost exclusively focused on deporting undocumented, as well as some credentialed, immigrants. 
Anti-money laundering investigations in Nevada casinos have flourished in recent years, initiated by federal authorities from the Central District of California. 
MGM paid $7.45 million to the feds as part of a non-prosecution agreement for failing to file suspicious activity reports, and another $8.5 million to Nevada regulators last month for the same offense. 
The GCB, based on federal prosecutions of illegal sports bookies Mathew Bowyer and Damien LeForbes, fined Resorts World $10.5 million in March. However, under the Trump administration, an anticipated non-prosecution agreement between Resorts World and the DOJ has yet to materialize. 
Two of three federal prosecutors who brought the charges against MGM and the illegal bookies have left the office, and Trump has replaced the U.S. Attorney who oversaw the cases. 
The president, who says he’s been persecuted and seeks to avenge individuals he perceives as similarly situated, may be unlikely to support anti-money laundering cases for personal reasons. 
Trump’s Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which closed in 2016, was plagued by repeated anti-money laundering violations and admitted to several willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, including failure to report suspicious transactions; failure to file currency transaction reports; and failure to keep adequate records, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN).
Trump, whose Las Vegas tower has no gambling, held a 10% share of the Riviera in the early 2000s.  In 2016, Harry Reid told the Washington Post that Trump couldn’t get a gaming license. 
Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, founder of Nevada-based Cantor Gaming, landed in hot water with Nevada gaming regulators, and paid a fine of $5.5 million, and with the DOJ, which he paid $16 million for engaging in illegal gambling and money laundering.  
Nevada Legislature up to bat
In the absence of aggressive federal pursuit of illegal actors, the Nevada Legislature is taking a crack at curbing offshore sites that cater to gamblers in the state. 
Senate Bill 256, which has passed both houses, would allow Nevada officials to prosecute illegal sites that cater to Nevadans and recoup the site’s gross receipts or profits, which would go into the state’s general fund. 
“While other states are looking to ban sweepstakes gambling and increase the penalties for illegal offshore gambling providers, Nevada may be the first to up the ante to include a provider’s ‘ill-gotten gains,’” reports Public Gaming International. 
The bill proposes increased penalties for individuals or entities facilitating illegal gambling, including the potential for felony charges.
It also seeks to derail the proliferation of so-called social casino sites, which presumably allow patrons to play games without money. 
“If you’ve ever had the opportunity to, unfortunately, click on that, which a lot of consumers do, you’re taken to an app that you download, where you purchase gold coins,” Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, sponsor of SB 256, testified before a Senate committee. “It is essentially gaming. It’s illegal gaming.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/55670D7E-92C8-4A41-A081-39D4A366F980-1024x571.jpeg,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)For almost five decades, a toxic sea of slowly decomposing trash has rested — hidden just below a grassy surface where, today, antelope sometimes graze. 
Ever since it closed down in 1979, the old North Temple landfill spanning 770 acres across a remote area between the Great Salt Lake and Salt Lake City International Airport has sat undisturbed. 
That is, until now.
On Wednesday, a small group of state officials gathered around a single excavator that was waiting to take the first scoop out of the landfill in decades — marking the beginning of a yearslong and expensive project to clean up the property and free it for industrial development that political leaders see as crucial for the state’s economic future.
“Let’s open this baby up!” shouted Gary McEntee, manager of Ninigret Construction, one of several companies state officials have contracted with to clean up the site. 
Some cheered as the excavator roared to life. The first scoop mostly contained “cover material,” McEntee said. “Just dirt.”

When the second scoop was dumped off to the side, it clinked with glass bottles. Then came a tire, and half-decomposed remains of countless other pieces of trash that were discarded decades ago. Mixed in with the dirt was a hair comb, mangled bits of unrecognizable rubber, and who knows what else. 
A few more swipes, and it didn’t take long for the stench to hit. As the rancid odor began to waft, McEntee ordered onlookers to stand off to the side, upwind. Once the excavator’s claw hit a layer of clay, he told the digger to stop so everyone could peer down into the trench and see the black sludge below. 
The grey leachate — toxic water that has percolated through all the layers of garbage — pooled at the bottom, dripping from the sides. The clay, McEntee explained, is largely why the landfill has had “minimal” contamination seeping off site because the thick clay has acted as a barrier, collecting all the leachate in something of a “bathtub.” 
There’s no telling exactly how much leachate will need to be dug up and pumped through an evaporative process as part of remediation efforts. But crews expect maybe 50,000 to 100,000 gallons just for the first phase of the cleanup, which includes 180 acres. As for the other 590 acres? They’re expecting a lot more — hundreds of thousands of gallons more leachate. 
It will take at least six or seven years — maybe many more, especially if crews come across something unexpected in the layers of dirt and garbage.

There’s a reason why no one’s cleaned up this old Salt Lake City landfill until now. For starters, it’s expensive. State officials estimate it will cost upwards of $200 million — likely more — over the next six or seven years. 
But why now? 
The push to clean up the landfill now — not later
For years, state leaders have eyed the site as a key parcel for the Utah Inland Port Authority, a powerful and controversial state entity that the Utah Legislature created in 2018 with the mission of establishing Utah as a “pivotal hub” in global trade and commerce. 
No, landlocked Utah doesn’t have a waterway or a shoreline that typically host ports, but the state’s Republican leaders have long had a vision that establishing the Utah Inland Port Authority would better coordinate the state’s warehouse, trucking and rail network to maximize the state’s import and export potential.
Back in 2018, a real estate arm of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints named the Suburban Land Reserve donated the landfill to a state agency that, at the time, was called the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA). That agency has since been renamed the Utah Trust Lands Administration, but it has the same mission: manage a portfolio of trust land to generate revenue for public schools and other state institutions. 
Trust Lands officials had already started the process to remediate the site in a “phased approach,” according to the Utah Department of Environmental Quality. But rather than cleaning up and developing parts of the 770 acres one at a time over the span of 20 or 30 years, state leaders wanted to tackle the project faster.

“The reality was someone was going to have to take this burden on at some point,” Ben Hart, executive director of the Utah Inland Port Authority, told Utah News Dispatch. “To a certain degree, it had been kicked down the road.” 
For port authority officials, Hart said their stance was “you can’t kick it down the road any further.” Waiting wasn’t “ideal,” he said, adding that “there was going to come a day” in 20 or 30 years that contaminants from the landfill could eventually seep into the Great Salt Lake.  
Plus, he said it’s more appealing for businesses to come to a fully remediated site rather than right next door to a former landfill. And he said costs would likely skyrocket in 20 years compared to today’s price tag. 
“Ultimately, for our partners, that was a hard and fast (rule) for us. We have to do this in five or six years. This cannot be a 20 or 30 year remediation,” Hart said.

That led to some “difficult negotiations” with SITLA officials that spanned years, he said. But in February, the port authority bought the land for $8 million, plus it paid $2 million to cover SITLA’s costs related to the property and additional payments to satisfy existing contractual agreements for previous remediation plans. 
“Yes, it led to some very hard conversations. It led to a two-year negotiation process with the prior land owner (SITLA),” Hart said. “And we don’t begrudge SITLA at all. They had a vision. They had some financial constraints. The port does not have those, so we felt like we were the better entity to take this on.” 
Financial means and the desire to develop the land quicker were the main reasons behind the port authority’s decision to take over the landfill remediation project, Hart said. To fund the remediation, port authority officials plan to use about $150 million in bonds the Utah Inland Port Authority Board voted to issue back in 2021. The rest, Hart said, will come from tax increment funds collected through the port authority’s project area. 
At the time, port authority officials envisioned using the $150 million in bonds to fund a massive truck-to-train transloading facility. But those plans have since been abandoned, the port authority’s brand and leadership changed amid frustration over lack of progress, and now instead state leaders are envisioning the landfill site to eventually be a hub for “advanced manufacturing.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)
That’s how Abby Osborne, Utah Inland Port Authority Board chair who is also chief of staff for Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, described it. In a speech before the excavator took its first scoop, Osborne motioned out to the east, where several Amazon warehouses have already been built nearby, saying “growth is coming this way.” 
“We really want to make this an epicenter of advanced manufacturing. Not just distribution centers, but advanced manufacturing with really high-paying jobs,” Osborne said. “This is going to be an economic engine for the state.” 
Osborne applauded the plans to push forward with more complete remediation now rather than later. 
“We’re going to start remediating, and we’re not going to stop remediating,” she said to applause. “We’re not going to develop until we stop remediating.”
Osborne also gave a nod to environmental reasons to clean up the landfill now, rather than later. 
“We’re on the edge of the Great Salt Lake,” she said. “We all know how important it is to this ecosystem and to this valley, and we’re going to make sure we do everything to protect it.
Continued controversy 
From the beginning, the Utah Inland Port Authority has been a controversial body. When lawmakers first created it, it took control of some 16,000 acres in Salt Lake County, some of which made up about a third of Salt Lake City’s remaining developable land.
Salt Lake City leaders cried overreach; they sued. A few years later, city leaders negotiated some changes to the board and its control over the inland port’s future tax increment, and the public tensions between the state and city over the issue largely fizzled. 
But environmental advocates remain staunch opponents. A coalition of community organizations called Stop The Polluting Ports are challenging the port authority’s constitutionality in court, and they continue to fight it as a “boondoggle” to benefit developers at the expense of Utahns and the environment. 
Environmentalists sue Inland Port, alleging ‘unconstitutionally formed’ board

They contend the port authority — through its planned developments in not just Salt Lake City but also its “satellite” ports in rural areas across the state — will only bring more warehouses, trucks and pollution to the state. 
Deeda Seed, a senior campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity who is also part of the Stop the Polluting Ports coalition, questions the port authority’s involvement in the landfill remediation and whether state officials can safely clean up the site within their desired timeframe. 
“I don’t really know if it can be done faster,” she said. “There’s a question about what are we the public getting in return? Are we going to get a more competent remediation? Or are we going to get a rushed remediation that cuts corners?”
She said the landfill is no “urgent crisis,” adding it’s been “stable” ever since it closed in 1979. But now that developers are starting to butt up against the landfill’s boundaries, they want to free up the land, and that’s the real “pressure point,” she said. 
“That’s really why they want to clean up the landfill, for the developers, to develop,” she said. 
Seed added that tax increment dollars that are supposed to offset impacts from industrial development on Salt Lake City residents are now going to be instead used to help finance the landfill remediation to “incentivize more industrial development.” 
“The bigger threat,” Seed said, isn’t the landfill, but pollution from all the development the inland port authority is bringing to not just Salt Lake City, but across the state. 
Seed also argued the landfill remediation is more about “the port authority being able to justify its existence.” 
“The port authority started as a boondoggle, and it’s still a boondoggle,” she said. “Every taxpayer in Utah should be concerned about this.” 
Seed likened the landfill remediation to “putting lipstick on a pig.” 
“They’re dressing up a very damaging agency with environmental remediation rhetoric,” she said. “But when you look at what is intended to happen in all of these (inland port) locations, the potential for enormous harm is there.” 
State officials including Hart and Osborne insist they’re working to “do this right.” 
To continued criticisms aimed at the port authority, Hart said he welcomes their involvement because they’ve “forced us to be better.” 
“We meet with them regularly. I would say they’re very well-intentioned individuals,” Hart said, though he added, “I think they’re getting fewer and fewer things to complain about because I think the port is doing right by everyone. Our hope is eventually to give them nothing to complain about.”

(Jemma Stephenson/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Attorney General’s Office said Wednesday the state may forgo drawing new congressional district maps before 2030 to prevent federal oversight of future redistricting. 
The state made the argument during a meeting with a three-judge federal panel and attorneys for plaintiffs who successfully challenged two congressional maps drawn by the Legislature in 2021 and 2023 that the panel said earlier this month showed intentional discrimination against Black voters. 
The plaintiffs asked the panel to consider preclearance under the Voting Rights Act as a possible remedy. Preclearance would require federal approval of any changes to election laws. Alabama was subject to preclearance from 1965 to 2013, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the relevant section of the Voting Rights Act that dictated preclearance for areas with histories of voting discrimination. But the law does allow courts to impose it as a remedy.
Less than two hours before Wednesday’s hearing, attorneys for the state filed a court document stating that while they “maintain their arguments about the necessity and constitutionality of any remedial plan,” legislative leaders “will voluntarily forgo any rights that they may have to attempt to draw an additional congressional district map as part of remedial proceedings in this case.”

“We have been talking to the state about the possibility of perhaps resolving some or all of the remedial issues in this case, and that we would like the court to give us an opportunity to continue to have those discussions if they prove fruitful,” said Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund representing the plaintiffs, during the status conference.
Federal court: Alabama Legislature intentionally discriminated against Black voters in redistricting

Jim Davis of the Alabama Attorney General’s Office said during the status conference that, though subject to appeal, the state agrees that the map drawn by a special master would be the final remedial map.
“There have been a few discussions,” Davis said to the three-judge panel. “It’s possible that it could influence the briefing, possibly even resolve some issues.”
A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with the Alabama Attorney General’s office.
The three-judge panel set a June 9 deadline for parties to file a joint written report on the status of the case and the possibility of resolving outstanding issues, including a request to place Alabama back into federal preclearance.
“Either we’re going to sort of settle things and resolve this case, or we’re going to continue on with our request for preclearance in this,” Ross said in a phone interview after the status conference.
The federal court ruling found that the Alabama Legislature had ignored previous orders to create a congressional map with two districts where Black voters would have a substantial opportunity to elect their preferred candidate. 
Alabama has had at least one majority-Black U.S. House district – the 7th – since 1992, but plaintiffs argued that it failed to give proper representation to Black Alabamians, who make up about 27% of the state’s population but, with a single majority-Black district, only made up 14% of Alabama’s U.S. House delegation. The three-judge panel struck down the 2021 map in 2022, ruling that racially polarized voting in Alabama meant that Black Alabamians could not select their preferred leaders. 
The judges ordered the state to draw a new map, a move the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2023. That summer, the Republican-controlled Legislature approved a map with one majority Black district and one district that was 40% Black. 
The judges sharply criticized the Legislature and appointed a special master who drew a map where two of Alabama’s seven U.S. House districts — the 2nd and the 7th – have majority-Black or near-majority Black populations. This map was used in the 2024 elections, resulting in the first time in history that Alabama elected two Black U.S. Representatives simultaneously.
The court Wednesday also provided a hearing schedule for the preclearance issue if a settlement is not reached. The state would file its brief by June 16, and the plaintiffs would have until June 23 to respond. Intervening legislative defendants would have until June 27 to file a reply.

For years lawmakers have worked to complete a budget prior to July 1, as required by state law, although failing to finish before the deadline carries no penalties. 
Hall has previously argued the Legislature’s responsibility under the state constitution is to pass a budget before the new Fiscal Year begins on Oct. 1, telling reporters the budget might not be finalized until Sept. 30, a move both Senate Democrats and Republicans have criticized as irresponsible.  
After teasing several budget items in the House’s plan for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 alongside fellow House Republicans, Hall once again refused to commit to finalizing the budget before the deadline. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Well, we’ll see. You know, I think we got to work through it,” Hall said when asked if he would commit to moving a budget out of the House before July. 
When pressed further, Hall criticized the Democratic-led Senate’s $84.6 billion budget proposal, arguing the budget was not balanced, following reports from the May 16 Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference which found lawmakers will have $320 million less in revenue than initially predicted, largely due to the impact of tariffs instituted by the Trump administration.
While the House has yet to pass its own proposals, Hall told reporters its budget would be smaller than the budget passed last year, when Democrats controlled the chamber. 
He also promised a $12,000 per-pupil allowance in the House’s education budget and $1 billion deposit in the state’s rainy day fund.
“This is going to make a big impact in our local school districts across Michigan, allow them to hire more teachers, shrink class sizes, update textbooks, invest in technology, improve school safety, and also, with that $1 billion rainy day fund, we’ll be able to prepare. If there’s any problems in the future that’ll be a good down payment toward addressing that,” Hall said
In the state’s higher education budget, Hall floated a $5,500 scholarship for every Michigan high school graduate attending a Michigan university or college which would be offered every year for up to four years. For community colleges, the state will offer students $2,750, Hall said. 
“We look at some of the scholarships that are being offered by the government, and a lot of them are based on, not everyone gets them. Some of them are based on income, family income, things like that,” he said.
“We want our universities to be attracting and working to gain Michigan students. And so I think really taking some of these scholarships that exist, and turning them into something that every Michigan high school student will receive to help make college and universities more affordable, while also ensuring they go to a Michigan University is going to make a big difference there,” Hall said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2597-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

CalMatters work was praised for showing “deep reporting” and “empathy” in this year’s Golden State Journalism Awards from the Sacramento Press Club.


CalMatters won four of this year’s Golden State Journalism Awards, for Capitol and environment reporting, California Voices commentary, and TV reporting driven by Digital Democracy.
The awards are given by the Sacramento Press Club for politics and public policy reporting across the state.
Alexei Koseff won for daily Capitol beat reporting.
The award is for a body of journalism showing “consistent daily excellence in beat reporting about the Capitol and/or state government.” Other finalists were journalists from Politico, the Los Angeles Times and KFF Health News.
Judges wrote: “We found Koseff’s entry to have an impressive range of Capitol-related stories, with stories that would meet the interests and needs of all Californians. We appreciated the mix of Capitol coverage approaches — accountability, following the money, and an inside glimpse at how the sausage is made. The entry covering Gov. Newsom’s promises on gun control was singled out for its approach and ability to cast a national eye on what happens in California’s Capitol. His entry reflected a deep understanding and skill on this vital beat.”
Koseff was awarded for highlights of his beat reporting: stories explaining why Gavin Newsom’s gun control constitutional amendment hasn’t gone beyond California, how California Democrats struck back against local conservative rebellions on LGBTQ rights and abortion, why no one spent more money than Google to lobby California officials, how Gavin Newsom had fallen short of his pledge to release his tax returns every year, and why Democratic messaging pivoted from ‘Trump-proofing’ California to affordability after the November election.
Rachel Becker won for environmental reporting.
An award that “recognizes exceptional reporting about policy, politics and activism related to water, wildfire, energy, climate change, pollution, endangered species and other environmental topics.” Other finalists were journalists from KQED and Capital & Main.
Judges wrote: “These stories, with their geographic sweep and intimate portraits, reveal the human toll of the state’s failure to confront its multiple water challenges, and the interplay between them. Becker documents how the depletion of groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley has led to a wrenching battle between farmers and regulators, while tens of thousands of low-income residents lack the most basic necessity – clean drinking water. Becker’s coverage shines because of her deep reporting, thoughtful storytelling and empathy for people caught in the crosshairs of water politics.”
Her 2024 reporting exposed policy failures underlying California’s collapsing fisheries, dwindling groundwater, polluted drinking water and aging infrastructure. She paid special attention to disadvantaged rural communities and skillfully covered generations-old tensions between agriculture and wildlife.
Yousef Baig won for opinion and commentary.
The award for “exceptional commentary that changed minds, held the powerful to account or perhaps simply delighted its audience.” Other finalists were commentary writers from the Los Angeles Times (Robert Greene, who recently joined the CalMatters commentary section) and Capital & Main.
Judges wrote: “We’ve all heard the attacks on the ‘train to nowhere.’ It’s never particularly easy to go against the pack. But Yousef Baig decided to get past the rhetoric and do real reporting on California’s high-speed rail project. For most Californians high speed rail is out of sight, out of mind, one of a long list of state government boondoggles. But in Fresno, people see hope for the future and a chance for revival. Without pulling punches – Baig writes about the delays and cost overruns – he delivered an honest, clear-eyed and compelling defense of the nation’s most ambitious high-speed rail project, interviewing merchants and workers, and high government officials in an especially strong piece of commentary.”
Baig’s commentary reviews California’s high-speed rail project outside of the traditional political worldview: centered in the Central Valley cities where the bullet train’s path will be centered.
“If you listen to California’s political class, the high-speed rail project sounds like a textbook boondoggle – over-budget, delayed and larded up with waste,” Baig writes. “Yet in communities across California’s farm belt, the discourse is refreshingly different. It’s a symbol of transformation for a region that’s already bursting with activity.”
CalMatters’ collaboration with CBS News won for TV enterprise reporting.
The honor is a powerful pairing of the rich Digital Democracy government-transparency database with reporting by Julie Watts of CBS News. The award is for Watts, CalMatters reporter Ryan Sabalow and Foaad Khosmood, an architect of Digital Democracy at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Other finalists were journalists from ABC10 and KCRA. No judging comments were provided for this award.
“California’s Fentanyl Fight” focused on advocates for fentanyl legislation who were upset to learn through Digital Democracy that their bills died when legislators declined to vote.
Watts’ broadcast followed a CalMatters’ story — “Power is never having to say ‘no.’ How California Democrats kill bills without voting against them” — co-authored by Sabalow and Watts. The story used data from Digital Democracy to look at more than 1 million votes cast by current legislators and revealed that Democrats voted “no” less than 1% of the time. Instead of directly voting against a bill, Democrats often killed bills by declining to vote.
And Christopher Buchanan, a former reporting fellow for the CalMatters College Journalism Network, was one of two journalists awarded for courage in journalism,
The award “recognizes a journalist or team of journalists who displayed exceptional courage to bring necessary coverage to the public.”
Judges wrote that a Gaza protest and counter-protest at UCLA “devolved into hours of violence, unchecked by the university or police. At least four UCLA student journalists were surrounded by counter-protesters, who sprayed the students with chemicals and punched and kicked two of them.” 
Buchanan, covering the protest for the Daily Bruin at UCLA, was beaten and kicked. He lost his phone during the assault, but he found it later, retrieved the video he shot, and published it.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sacpressclubawards.2025.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

Vernon Jordan, who once worked alongside Medgar Evers as a field secretary for the NAACP and later advised Bill Clinton, survived an assassination attempt in Fort Wayne, Indiana, by racist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin (who also wounded Hustler publisher Larry Flynt in 1978). 
Franklin was acquitted of the assault — only to confess his guilt years later. In an interview, Franklin said he considered Adolf Hitler his hero and “Mein Kampf” his Bible. “I read it hundreds of times.” 
Trying to start a “race war,” he said he bombed synagogues, shot interracial couples and killed “enemies of the white race.” By the time it ended, he had killed at least 22 people, including Jackson State University student Johnnie Noyes Jr., who had simply been washing his car. 
In 2013, Franklin was executed in Missouri for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue in St. Louis.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28111300/May29-FeatImage-AP963133884290.jpg,,,2025-05-29 09:09:18.325081

Ten out of 17 eligible voters cast their ballot. Eight voted to join, while two voted against it.
Six baristas led the charge to bring the workers into the Starbucks Workers United (SBWU), which represents over 570 union Starbucks stores, including locations in Scottsboro and Birmingham.

“We’re absolutely thrilled to win our union election here in Huntsville,” said organizing member Briar Wolf in a statement. “We can’t wait to sit down at the bargaining table and fight for the respect and security we deserve.”
Leaders of Starbucks Workers United have been trying to negotiate a union contract with the company since 2021. But four years later, hundreds of unionized stores and thousands of unionized workers later, there is still no contract.
Starbucks and the union announced a framework to address pending legal disputes over allegations of unfair labor practices and discrimination. According to the Guardian, talks broke down in late 2024 over pay issues and because they hadn’t resolved the lawsuits.
“For months, and in many cases, over a year, union partners have been waiting for meaningful contract negotiations. Instead of engaging in earnest dialogue, the company has repeatedly delayed, walked out of sessions, and refused to meet workers’ basic demands for dignity, respect, and a voice on the job,” Wolf said.\
Starbucks posted a statement on collective bargaining in 2023.
“As we work toward building a bridge to a better future for all partners, we continue to be committed to bargaining in a way that honors and respects the dignity, individuality and privacy of our partners. Each store’s contract will be negotiated separately and ratified accordingly.”
The company did not respond to an additional request for comment.

Phil Murphy have wildly different plans to rein in New Jersey's high cost of living. (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)[Election 2025 Voter Guide: Eleven candidates are running in the June 10 Democratic and GOP gubernatorial primaries.]Affordability is perennially a top issue in New Jersey elections, and the six Democrats hoping to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy all have plans to bring down costs here in the Garden State.
The Democrats, who are vying on June 10 for their party’s nod for governor in November, have plans to lower costs that range from broad tax code changes that would place more of the burden on wealthy residents to expanded tax credits for families and low-income individuals to significant tax cuts for property owners.
New Jersey’s cost of living and tax burdens could well decide the race for the state’s next governor. An Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill poll of New Jersey voters from earlier this month found 45% of respondents said the economy (including taxes) is the No. 1 issue facing New Jersey, followed by housing affordability at 12%.
It remains to be seen how voters will judge Democrats’ affordability promises after eight years under a Democratic governor. Neither party has won three successive terms as New Jersey’s governor since 1961.
“If you’re unhappy with the way things are going, you vote for a change. If you’re happy with the way things are going, you vote for whoever’s in charge,” said Dan Cassino, the director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University poll. “So it’s entirely plausible that voters are going to go to that voting booth and say, ‘Well, New Jersey’s unaffordable. We need a change. Let’s vote for a Republican.’”
 Ras Baraka (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
 Baraka

Tax reform features heavily in Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’s affordability plan. The progressive Democrat has proposed taxing the first $90,000 of income residents earn at 1.4%, the rate currently charged on the first $20,000 earned in a year, and reducing rates for those making less than $500,000.
Under Baraka’s plan, marginal rates would fall to 6.37% for those making at least $152,000, to 7.5% for those making at least $350,000, 9% for those with incomes of at least $500,000, and 10% for residents who earn at least $750,000.
Those who make at least $1 million would pay more under Baraka’s plan, and the state’s top earners would pay the highest state income tax rates in the nation.
Marginal rates for individuals making more than $1 million annually would range from 11% to 14% under Baraka’s plan, with the highest bracket kicking in after $10 million in annual earnings.
California’s top state income tax bracket, the highest in the nation, taxes earnings above $1 million at 13.3%.
Baraka says these changes would boost annual collections by about $2 billion.
 Steve Fulop (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)
 Fulop

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop also favors higher taxes for high earners.
Fulop would create new tax brackets for those earning $2 million, $5 million, and $10 million per year. Fulop’s affordability plan does not state the levels of the new brackets, but a New Jersey Policy Perspective report cited by his plan recommends they be set to 12%, 13%, and 14%, respectively. The think tank’s report, published in November, says the changes would generate $1.2 billion annually.
Fulop says he would like to raise the state’s earned income tax credit — which offsets tax burdens for very low-income residents with credits worth between $253 and $3,132 in 2024 — to 50% of the federal benefit, from 40%.
He’s also proposed changes to Stay NJ, a new state program that aims to halve senior citizens’ property taxes. Fulop would reduce the income limit for Stay NJ participants from $500,000 to $150,000 and make the program’s credits flat and phased-in rather than based on a resident’s property tax bill.

 Gottheimer

Tax cuts lie at the center of Rep. Josh Gottheimer’s affordability agenda. The five-term congressman’s cost-lowering plan centers around a promise to reduce state and local taxes by a combined $5.9 billion through a raft of cuts, credits, and rebates. The state’s average property tax bill in 2024 was $10,095
Gottheimer proposes requiring local governments to cut property taxes to receive an equal amount of state income tax revenue, echoing a Republican school-funding proposal from years past. 
Gottheimer’s version proposes to move roughly $4.7 billion in annual costs from local ledgers to the state budget. Because property taxes are set locally, municipalities would have to act to lower them, and matching state funds would only be offered to those that undertake efficiency reviews that Gottheimer says would pay for his tax cuts.
He says those reviews would cut 5% of state and local spending — $2.9 billion at the state level and $2.4 billion locally — by merging departments, unifying procurement offices, and even removing light bulbs from vending machines.
Local governments billed a little less than $35.7 billion in property taxes last year, according to state records, meaning that across-the-board 5% cuts would have produced close to $700 million less than the $2.9 billion advertised by Gottheimer’s plan.
The congressman’s property and income tax credits for renters, those with dependents, retirees, and businesses would reduce state revenue by $1.2 billion each year.
 Mikie Sherrill (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
 Sherrill

Rep. Mikie Sherrill has eschewed proposing broad changes to the tax code, though she favors increasing award amounts for the state’s child tax credit — a per-child refundable tax credit worth between $1,000 and $200, depending on income — and its earned income tax credit.
She would also create a caregiver assistance tax credit for residents caring for elderly family members. Sherrill has not proposed specific levels for any of the tax credits.
The congresswoman also proposes the return of a sales tax holiday for back-to-school items. The state implemented that in 2023 but halted it last year as the state’s budgeting began to tighten.
 Sean Spiller (Edwin J. Torres/NJ Governor’s Office)
 Spiller

New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller’s policy platform places little focus on affordability, at least in the realm of taxes.
He says he would seek to expand the child and dependent care tax credits, which offset a portion of taxpayers’ child care expenses, and boost other assistance for child care.
The state’s child and dependent care tax credit is set as a percentage of the federal benefit — $3,000 for a single filer or $6,000 for joint filers.
At present, New Jersey’s child and dependent care tax credit offers between 50% and 10% of the federal benefit, with those earning less than $30,000 receiving the largest credits and those making between $120,000 and $150,000 the smallest.
  Steve Sweeney (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
 Sweeney

Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney’s affordability plan focuses on seniors.
He has proposed a massive expansion of state income tax exclusions for retirees that would entirely eliminate all income tax for residents 65 and older with a household income of no more than $250,000.
At present, residents 62 and over who make no more than $100,000 can exclude from their income taxes large portions of their pension income — $100,000 for joint filers, $75,000 for single filers, and $50,000 for married individuals filing separate returns. 
Those with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 can exclude a percentage of their pension income from their taxes.
A separate process calculates exclusions for other types of retirement income, and New Jersey does not tax social security benefits. It’s not clear how much Sweeney’s exclusion proposal would cost the state in foregone revenue.
Sweeney also proposes lowering income limits for Stay NJ from $500,000 to $250,000.
That program, due to issue its first half-year benefit in the fiscal year that begins July 1, is expected to cost at least $1.2 billion annually under current law. It’s not clear how much money the state would save by halving the program’s income limit.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)MACKINAC ISLAND – Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan says he would propose investing $4.5 billion in Michigan’s schools if elected governor.
But he warned that investment would come with “punishment” for school administrators who fail to show progress toward education goals.
“If we’re going to pour $4.5 billion into our schools, the people who run the schools need to have some skin in the game,” Duggan said of his proposal, which he said was likely to “piss people off.”
Duggan gives a keynote address at the Mackinac Policy Conference every year as Detroit’s mayor, offering him a platform to tout his independent campaign in a way that his opponents in the Democratic and Republican primaries could not.
He said he decided to run for governor as an independent because of a “broken system” that has failed the state’s residents, as evidenced by population loss and low fourth-grade reading scores.
“I look at the trends of young people leaving across a whole bunch of governors. I look at the trend of the kids reading scores declining across a whole bunch of governors. And I thought, somebody has to say, the problem isn’t the governor, the problem’s the system,” Duggan said.
Other than suggesting the additional funding would come from reallocating existing state revenues and unspecified federal funds, Duggan provided no additional financial details.

Duggan pointed to shifting policies under Republican and Democratic governors as an example, including an A-F grading system for school performances that was created, replaced and saw its replacement get replaced before it was created again and then repealed again, all in the span of about 10 years.
“There’s no central vision that says, here’s what we’re going to do for the kids,” Duggan said. “It’s ‘what can I do to pass a bill that will give me a partisan advantage in the next election?’”
He said he would collaborate with educator groups to create some form of school grading plan – whether it be an A-F scale, based on percentages, or some other format that is easy for parents to understand – and place a five-year moratorium on changes to the grading system to allow results to be measured over time.
Results would be measured over five years, the same amount of time the $4.5 billion would be invested over to train more teachers and literacy instructors, as well as rebuilding career technical education programs offered in high schools.
If a school is failing in the first year, they would be required to submit an improvement plan. If they fail to improve by year two, the state would offer a support team to help turn things around. By the third year, if there is still no improvement, the principal would be fired and a new leadership team would be put in place.
“If you were in business and your business declined three years in a row, you either get rid of the leader or you go out of business,” Duggan said. “Only in public education can the principal fail year after year, and you send the next group of kids.”
If there is still no improvement by year five, Duggan said the district’s superintendent would be fired as well.
He said selecting replacement principals and superintendents would be left up to the local school boards.
Duggan said Michigan residents are “losing confidence in what’s happening in the schools,” citing the number of local millages that failed to pass in May special elections.
Polling commissioned by the Detroit Regional Chamber shows that Duggan pulls voters equally from Democrats and Republicans and is the only candidate with favorable views from both liberals and conservatives.
Other candidates for governor include Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the Democratic primary, as well as U.S. Rep. John James, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Attorney General Mike Cox and former congressional nominee Anthony Hudson in the Republican primary.
Duggan chastised Benson and Attorney General Dana Nessel for criticizing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s appearances with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office and at Selfridge Air Force Base.
“This chaos became a national embarrassment,” Duggan said.

Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, helped persuade the Kansas Legislature to pass a state sales tax incentive for developers of Kansas data centers valued at more than $250 million. On Wednesday, the planning commission of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, voted to endorse plans for a $12.6 billion data storage facility west of the Kansas Speedway. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The planning commission of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas, endorsed a proposal to establish a 550-acre business park for construction of a $12.6 billion data center that would become part of the internet’s backbone.
The planning commission voted 4-2 to recommend Wednesday the Unified Government Board of Commissioners adopt a package of rezoning, preliminary platting and master plan amendments to accommodate six huge buildings with a total of 1.8 million square feet. The “hyperscale” facility bisected by Parallel Parkway would be on property currently zoned for residential or agriculture use.
“We think it’s responsible development that’s going to bring the absolute best bang for the buck to the county,” said Corb Maxwell, an attorney representing developer Red Wolf DCD Properties.
No corporate occupant has been publicly disclosed for the site several miles west of the Kansas Speedway, but it would likely be one of big-tech companies Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon or Alphabet.
Maxwell said the business park designation would lead to a development that looked more like office buildings than an industrial complex. The property would be ringed with eight-foot earth berms, 3,000 trees and other landscaping to obstruct the view of people living nearby.
Homes on the perimeter of the property would be 500 feet to 1,400 feet from the nearest data center building, he said.
“It’s very much about … how do we give all of the neighbors the maximum buffer we can,” Maxwell said. “You’re trying to deliver a high quality development with attractive buildings. You’re trying to have performance standards that say all operations shall be conducted within a fully enclosed building. You’re saying no noise, odors, vibrations or other impacts shall be discernable off the premises.”
The energy-devouring data center buildings would be packed with computer servers supporting the digital economy. Developers pledged to pay the cost of utility upgrades necessary to extend electricity service to the data center, a commitment that included paying the UG Board of Public Utilities to build two substations.
The substations would be called on to handle 600 megawatts of power. That would be an amount greater than BPU’s current 500 megawatt capability, meaning the project would need to drawn from the Southwest Power Pool.
“We believe it is growing power resiliency as well as growing revenues for the BPU and is a real reason for pushing this forward,” Maxwell said.
 
‘Against it. Period.’
Planning commissioner Aaron Ward, who voted against the project, said anyone driving around the proposed site would quickly understand it was an agriculture region dotted with fields, pastures and livestock. The idea of dropping a business park into a mix of farmsteads and residential neighborhoods didn’t make sense, he said.
“In no way, shape or form is this industrial,” Ward said. “I just don’t see how it fits in with the community that we have there, because it really doesn’t.”
James Sheets, who owns property in the development zone, was among folks who attended the planning commission meeting to register opposition.
“I’m against it. Period,” he said. “This project has got me totally surrounded. I guess because I never returned calls about selling.”
The UG should include in the development blueprint a requirement the data center run on solar or wind power, said Ty Gorman, who works with the Sierra Club. Albert McComas, who lives near the site, said the UG should establish a fund to compensate residents if their water wells became contaminated due to heavy construction.
Neal Palmer, another critic of the project, proposed a 30-day delay in the planning commission’s vote to determine whether developers ignored a handful of procedural requirements.
Liberty Church representative Rich Lavin said the data center could be a deterrent to people who might otherwise attend the Parallel Parkway church in the future.
“There is simply too many unanswered questions concerning these data centers,” Lavin said. “Let your conscience be your guide.”
 
Tax advantages
Advocates touted economic development potential of the project, and the fact it could become the county’s largest source of property tax revenue at an estimated $12.9 million annually. The land on the site currently generated about $43,000 annually in property tax revenue for the city, county, state, schools, colleges and library.
“We believe these rezoning projects for the data centers is a strategic and forward-thinking decision,” said Greg Kindle, president of the Wyandotte Economic Development Council. “Development will occur in this area. We believe a business park would be preferable to alternatives that we’ve been looking at, including apartment complexes.”
During the final day of the 2025 session of the Kansas Legislature, a 20-year state sales tax exemption was approved for construction of Kansas data centers costing a minimum of $250 million.
The sales tax break covered purchases for development, acquisition and operation of a data center, including land and site improvements as well as buildings and equipment; labor services to install and maintain data center equipment; purchases by a contractor to build or modify a data center; as well as acquisition of backup generators.
A data center accepting the state sales tax break couldn’t take advantage of a law lowering utility rates for large economic development projects by 20% to 40% over 10 years.

When I worked at Safe Recovery, I saw every day how losing access to resources, such as free food, causes profound harm to our entire community.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Cora Honigford: Supporting Burlington’s downtown means supporting Food Not Cops.","This commentary is by Cora Honigford of Hinesburg. She worked at the Howard Center’s Burlington syringe service program, Safe Recovery, until this March. Most of the clients she worked with at Safe Recovery are unhoused, and many eat at the Food Not Cops daily free lunch distribution. I am deeply disappointed to see that Burlington’s city council has voted to force the Food Not Cops daily lunch distribution to move from the Marketplace Parking Garage. I have read the letter from Burlington businesses to the city administration and I fail to see how moving this free, community lunch program will help anyone.The only reason provided to move the FNC lunch distribution is that some of the people fed have “have repeatedly stolen from businesses or caused harm”. Are we then to accept that people’s negative behavior means they deserve to starve? I refuse to tolerate the idea that imperfect behavior should be punished by denying someone food.I understand that the open letter from Burlington businesses does not call for the elimination of the FNC lunch distribution, but where are they meant to move to? Where else in the downtown area would host FNC?In a city that lacks any free public transportation, the location of services is absolutely critical to their availability — if FNC is forced to move away from the downtown area, the people who need access to free food the most will no longer be able to access it. Furthermore, taking services away from the most vulnerable and poorest members of our communities harms all of us. It does not just harm the people who eat lunch every day at the parking garage, though of course it will harm them most of all; it also harms the businesses who have signed this letter.We know that crime, especially the shoplifting that has burdened the downtown area, is directly correlated with poverty. When people do not have their basic needs met, when they are sleeping unsheltered on the sidewalk and waking up every day not knowing where their next meal will come from, they are more likely to steal to meet their needs. FNC meets one of those needs: everyone knows they can get lunch every day at the Marketplace Garage. I do agree with the signers of the open letter on a few counts. They ask for more support to respond to mental health crises and express their desire to enjoy a safe, welcoming Burlington. We all want to live in safe communities — and when I say all, I mean most especially my community members who are unhoused and therefore extremely vulnerable to interpersonal violence.When I feel unsafe, I know that I can go home. I can lock the door. The people I worked with at Safe Recovery, a community that I care about deeply, do not have this “privilege.”Being unhoused is both disabling and traumatizing. Every single person I worked with there, regardless of their mental health when they became unhoused, has developed symptoms of PTSD.It is very true that they need more mental health support, and that Burlington as a whole needs more resources to respond to these crises. I beg you to recognize that Food Not Cops is one of those resources.When I worked at Safe Recovery, I saw every day how losing access to resources, such as free food, causes profound harm to our entire community. If we all want a safe, thriving community, we must commit ourselves to ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met — all flourishing is mutual. The FNC lunch program is free for both recipients and the city. This organization is not funded by taxpayers. It does not cost the community anything; all they need from Burlington is an accessible place in the downtown area where they can distribute food to anyone who needs it.Food Not Cops is asking very little of our community and shame on us if we deny them such a low ask. Do not strip another resource away — we have already lost enough, and our neighbors are hungry. If you do not want to feed them, do not tell them how, or where, to eat. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Cora Honigford: Supporting Burlington’s downtown means supporting Food Not Cops.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-29 07:59:49.234194

Though modest in scope, this law will have a profound impact on those it protects.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Emmett Avery: Expanding job-protected leave Is a win for working Vermonters.","This commentary is by Emmett Avery of Burlington. He manages the Vermont Paid Leave Coalition, an organization of over 80 businesses, nonprofits and everyday Vermonters working to ensure no one has to choose between making a living and caring for themselves or their loved ones.Caring for a sick parent, settling a loved one’s estate, or escaping abuse are some of life’s most difficult experiences. No one should lose their job for facing them. Thanks to the recent tripartisan passage of H.461, more Vermonters won’t have to. This new law expands access to job-protected leave, so more people can care for themselves and their family without risking their livelihoods.For over 30 years, Vermont has guaranteed many workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off to care for themselves or a loved one during serious health events or when welcoming a new child. This bill strengthens and expands those protections.The new law recognizes that family comes in many forms and broadens eligibility accordingly, particularly by updating definitions to better include LGBTQ+ families. H.461 also adds important new protected categories to Vermont’s unpaid leave statute, including bereavement leave, safe leave and military leave.The bereavement provision allows workers time to grieve, attend a funeral or settle affairs after the death of a loved one. Safe leave ensures survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking can take time off to heal or seek safety without fear of job loss. The military leave provision supports workers dealing with needs related to a family member’s military service.Though modest in scope, this law will have a profound impact on those it protects.It strengthens what makes Vermont strong: our shared commitment to fairness, justice, and dignity in our workplaces and communities. It means more families can be there for one another. It means those experiencing loss have the space to mourn and begin to heal. It means survivors can prioritize safety without risking their job. Thank you to the Vermont Legislature for passing this bill, and to Gov. Phil Scott for signing it. These protections offer relief during some of life’s hardest moments — and that matters. But we can and must build on this success.While this legislation ensures more Vermonters can return to their jobs after taking unpaid leave, far too many still can’t afford to take that leave at all. Roughly 76% of Vermont’s workforce lacks access to paid leave through their employer, and each year, Vermont workers lose an estimated $85 million in wages due to unpaid or underpaid leave.  That number does not begin to account for the hardship faced by those forced to put off critical healthcare, rush back to work after childbirth or stay with an abusive partner simply because they cannot survive without the income.Beyond the toll on individuals and families, this weakens our communities and Vermont’s economy. Lost wages and lost jobs mean less spending at local businesses, less saving for retirement, fewer people in our workforce and more stress for folks already stretched to the breaking point. This is why the Vermont Paid Leave Coalition continues to urge lawmakers and the governor to enact a strong paid leave program for all working Vermonters: because no one should have to choose between making a living and caring for themselves or their loved ones.While H.461 isn’t the comprehensive solution we need, it’s a meaningful step forward. By passing H.461, lawmakers have helped ensure fewer Vermonters are forced to choose between their jobs and their families.That’s a victory worth celebrating — and building on.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Emmett Avery: Expanding job-protected leave Is a win for working Vermonters.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-29 07:59:49.234194

She is a parent of two kids and has been active in state and local efforts to build grassroots support for issues including climate action, approving the capital bond for Winooski school district improvements and expanding voting access to all legal residents in Winooski city elections. She is associate director at VPIRG.To my elected officials and school district leaders:I live in Winooski. Our schools are not just the hub of public education, but also where our diverse community comes together and invests in one another. With the passage of Act 127, our school district is finally getting the share of public education funds for our kids to have equal educational opportunities to kids who live in wealthier towns.The law brings our distribution of resources into alignment with the ruling of the Vermont Supreme Court in the Brigham decision. And our school is thriving.At the same time, my property taxes, like so many others, skyrocketed last year. It’s rough. I still voted for our school and city budgets, but I can understand why many folks felt they could not.I can understand our leaders’ sense of urgency to address taxpayers’ concerns. But what I see the governor and Senate doing now is repeating the mistakes of past reforms — where you made major changes without fully understanding the consequences.READ MORE
As a taxpayer, homeowner and parent, I beg our leaders to take a page from what we teach our kids. Do your homework. When you’re making an important decision, pause and consider the impacts of your decision. If other people are impacted, make sure they have a chance to understand what change means and have an opportunity to weigh in.The future of our public school system is too important for radical, sweeping and rapid education reforms without us all truly understanding the impacts and whether these changes will actually fix the problem of rising property taxes.On education reform, please pause. Here is some homework.Convene a joint hearing of the House and Senate where you present the details of your reforms and invite superintendents, school board members, parents, students and taxpayers to weigh in.Share the many and varied factors that contributed to property tax hikes.
Study the unintended consequences of Act 127 that did impact many districts’ school budgets.
Delay action on major education reforms until the consequences are fully understood and communicated to district leaders, parents and taxpayers, and feedback is offered.
Commit to a statewide listening, learning and information-gathering tour.Your work could/should include:Conducting a statewide tour of school districts with delegates from the House and Senate Education, Finance and Appropriations Committees, and the secretary of education.
Presenting more than one course of possible action to the problem of rising property taxes and the potential pros and cons of these approaches.
Pursuing reforms to property taxes that will help families, such as addressing income “cliffs” in state funding support.
Prioritizing addressing the double-digit health insurance premium hikes that have driven up the personnel costs for our schools. I’ll note that this would also help small businesses and nonprofit organizations that are also struggling to keep up with the rising costs of health care.
Sharing a plan for building more affordable housing to stem the skyrocketing housing costs and attracting more families and children to live in or stay in Vermont.Your stalemates and political threats have lost sight of what matters — providing equitable, high-quality public education to all of Vermont’s children regardless of race, class, disability, family circumstances, language of origin, gender and more.Take a break from Montpelier. Come to Winooski. Meet with the educators and families your decisions impact before casting a vote on major reform.If Gov. Scott is not willing to pause, then I urge him and the secretary of education to engage constructively with lawmakers and Vermont’s local districts in this process.We’re getting enough top-down threats and upsetting sweeping changes from D.C.

The Washington State Beekeepers Association will use proceeds to support research and public education on pollinators. (Image courtesy of Washington State Beekeepers Association)Washington drivers really like their specialty license plates — and they are getting more of them. 
Up to six new options will arrive this fall, including plates featuring Smokey Bear, pickleball paddles, and pollinators. Old-style plates, one with white lettering on a black background and the other with green lettering on a white background, are in the mix too.
Another seven offerings — including one showcasing Mount St. Helens — would become available if their backers garner enough support.
The 13 plates are parked in an omnibus bill signed into law May 20 by Gov. Bob Ferguson. 
Those issued would join the nearly 70 different special license plates in Washington recognizing the military, sports teams, colleges, farmers, orcas, lighthouses, square dancers and wine. Fees vary, with the money generally going to support causes that are tied to each plate’s theme.
This latest group of 13 will be the last for a while. The new law, Senate Bill 5444, bars the state Department of Licensing from accepting or issuing applications for any additional plates until Jan. 1, 2029. Notice of this moratorium must be posted prominently on the agency website.
And the licensing department must set up a work group to delve into the specialty plate program — from how applications are handled and plates are chosen to the state’s ability to recoup costs from less popular plates.
Sen. Adrian Cortes, D-Battle Ground, sponsored the legislation, which had a companion bill in the House authored by Rep. Ed Orcutt, R-Kalama and Rep. Brandy Donaghy, D-Snohomish County.
Cortes attributed its success to Bill Ramos, the late state senator, for providing the energy and strategy to cement Senate approval on April 18. 
Ramos died the next night while on a trail run near his Issaquah home. 
“It has Sen. Ramos’ fingerprints all over it,” Cortes said in an emotional floor speech April 25 when the Senate took the final vote that sent it on to Ferguson. 
In tribute, the legislation is known as “Bill’s bill.”
“We’re thinking about Bill as we’re signing this legislation,” Ferguson said.
Coming this fall
The state Department of Licensing will begin issuing new plates on Nov. 1, barring any issues with their design and production. There is an initial fee of $40 for special plates and a renewal fee of $30. 
One will recognize pickleball, named the official state sport in 2022. It will be the first pickleball license plate in the nation. The Seattle Metro Pickleball Association launched the effort in 2022 and first secured the state Senate’s support in 2023. Proceeds will be used for the construction and maintenance of dedicated pickleball courts throughout the state.  
Smokey Bear will be featured on another. Proceeds will go to the Department of Natural Resources’ wildfire prevention programs. Hilary Franz, the former commissioner of public lands, championed the idea and her successor, Dave Upthegrove, has picked up the baton. Washington will join Oregon and Texas with Smokey Bear plates.
“Approximately 90% of wildfires every year are human caused. We couldn’t have a better advocate for wildfire prevention crisscrossing Washington along our interstates, highways and roads than Smokey,” Upthegrove said in a news release.
A monarch, a honey bee and a mason bee will star on a license plate. The Washington State Beekeepers Association will use proceeds to support research and educational activities about such pollinators. And the LeMay classic car museum in Tacoma will have one with its logo to generate funds for education and job training related to automobiles.
The licensing department will issue two plates featuring styles from past eras.
A “Keep Washington Evergreen” plate will help fund installation of electric charging stations. It will have green lettering on a white background like ones Washington issued in the 1970s.
The other plate will have white lettering on a black background similar to the design of those issued in the early 20th century. Money raised will be used for expanding and improving driver’s education programs and activities.
On deck
The remaining seven special license plates authorized in the law will be issued if a sponsor submits at least 3,500 signatures in support.
Mount St. Helens could be the first in this batch. Proceeds would go to Mount St. Helens Institute, a private nonprofit organization, to support youth education, land stewardship and science at Washington’s most active volcano, which is located in the southwest corner of the state. Supporters had previously submitted signatures, but their application expired and they must resubmit, according to the department.
Other pending plates include:

A working forests plate to support the Washington Tree Farm Program. That program helps certify small landowners who practice sustainable forestry.
A nautical northwest plate to celebrate Whidbey Island’s maritime communities. Money raised would go to Whidbey Island Maritime Heritage Foundation and Historic Whidbey. 
A Donate Life plate with proceeds going to LifeCenter Northwest to build awareness for organ donation.
A Firefighter Memorial plate with funds going to the Washington State Council of Firefighters to benefit firefighters and their families in need.
A Naval Academy plate with receipts going to the state’s Veterans Stewardship Account to benefit veterans or their families. Washington now has six Armed Forces special license plates.
A Seattle Reign FC plate with proceeds going to the RAVE foundation, the nonprofit charity for the club and for the Seattle Sounders. The Sounders already have a license plate.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pollinator-plate.jpg,,,2025-05-29 07:59:49.234194

I need to report someone who’s a danger to themselves and others. It’s the Florida Legislature.
No, operator, this is not a joke! Didn’t you hear what they did? After one of Florida’s worst hurricane seasons in years, they passed a bill to block local governments from trying to build back better.
And they did it right before the start of another hurricane season, one that’s predicted to be above normal, just like last year. No, I can’t tell you why it’s supposed to be so bad. It involves climate change, and the governor doesn’t want us to talk about that.
Even if climate change wasn’t heating up the Gulf of Whatchamacallit to a temperature that you’re more accustomed to seeing in an oven, this hurricane season seems especially fraught with peril because of the chaos in Washington.
The tumult and the shouting in D.C. are interfering with disaster aid and preparation. Nothing increases everyone’s pre-storm jitters like hearing that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is not ready for the season.
I know Gov. Ron DeSantis has been trying to convince everyone that Florida doesn’t really need FEMA, even though it stepped up to hand over $1 billion to aid homeowners and renters last year.
But this is the guy who can’t even get members of his own party to approve a new state budget. That means we could be facing a state government shutdown on July 1, shortly after the start of hurricane season on June 1.
So, given the unreliability of FEMA, the prediction of another horrible hurricane season, and this ill-considered bill that passed Tallahassee with flying colors, can you see why I’m worried that the Legislature wants to kill us?
I mean, does it sound to you like they’re paying attention to anyone’s safety, including their own?
 The exact opposite of safe
Operator, the bill they passed, the one that puts everyone in peril, is Senate Bill 180. That’s a pretty good description of it, too, because it’s 180 degrees from what would have been much safer for all concerned.
The specific part of the bill that’s got me and a lot of other people worried would prevent any local government in Florida from adopting anything for its growth regulations after a hurricane that could be deemed too “restrictive or burdensome” to developers.
“One part of the bill prevents cities and counties listed in federal disaster declarations for Hurricanes Debby, Helene, and Milton — a majority of the state — from adopting tougher development rules until October 2027. The ban is retroactive to August 2024, also threatening to undo any recent rule changes,” the Miami Herald reported last week.
And there’s no real end-date for what it does, either. We could be stuck with this restriction forever.
“Another part of the bill calls for a similar one-year ban anytime a local government is listed in a federal disaster declaration and lies within 100 miles of a hurricane’s path,” the Herald said. “It could renew each time a storm strikes Florida’s coast, a regular occurrence for the storm-plagued state.”
  Kim Dinkins via 1,000 Friends of Florida
“These are decisions that need to be made by local governments locally, not by people in Tallahassee,” Kim Dinkins of the smart growth group 1000 Friends of Florida told me. “Every time a storm comes through, we learn more about how to deal with them.”
Worse, she pointed out, the bill will interfere with the ability of cities and counties to take advantage of money from the feds and the state for converting septic tanks to sewers and fixing drainage problems. If those fixes require ordinance changes that affect development, such as requiring new homes to connect to the sewer lines, this bill won’t allow it.
How did we get here? Bear in mind that we’re a state surrounded on three sides by water, so we’re especially vulnerable to a rising sea level. Yet our state has seen rampant overdevelopment in flood-prone spots in recent years.
Our blatantly pro-development legal and political structure has turned the state into a hotbed of poorly planned projects that are constantly risking inundation. Developers don’t want that to change.
  State Sen. Nick DiCeglie via Florida Senate
Here’s the truly alarming thing, operator: This idiotic bill was sponsored by Sen. Nick DiCeglie,  whose own home flooded during Hurricane Helene.
He’s a storm victim himself, yet he’s OK with blocking cities and counties from putting in place any additional protections for future storm victims. DiCeglie is in the trash-hauling business, so maybe that’s why he pushed this particular piece of garbage.
Despite the obvious life-threatening flaws in this bill, our fine Legislature passed it by nearly a unanimous vote in both houses. I swear, it’s as if we’re being governed by the writers of the TV show “Seinfeld: “No hugging and no learning!”
And operator, did I mention that this isn’t the first time they’ve done this kind of thing?
 Strike one, strike two …
The first time this happened was in early 2023, a few months after Hurricane Ian.
Ian, you may recall, clobbered the Southwest Florida coast and killed 149 people. “Scores drowned as they fled on foot, while in their cars or after seawater swallowed their homes,” NBC News reported. “Ian was one of the deadliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. in the past 20 years.”
The high body count showed that the development pattern in that area had flaws. It would have been great if Lee County had done something to adjust its building regulations in response.
But Lee couldn’t.
  State Sen. Jonathan Martin via Florida Senate
When the Legislature met in special session the following February, one of Lee County’s own, Sen. Jonathan Martin of Fort Myers, sponsored a bill that said local officials in the area hit by Ian could not impose any new development rules deemed “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books.
Marttin’s bill passed the Legislature and was signed into law by DeSantis. It covered a 100 square mile radius affected by Ian. Also, it was set to expire in 2024. That was strike one.
Months later, the Big Bend area was smashed by powerful Hurricane Idalia. The casualty count wasn’t as high, but the property damage was really bad.
  State Rep. Jason Shoaf via Florida House
During a special session in November 2023, a new bill, sponsored by Rep. Jason Shoaf of Port St. Joe, extended the ban on any commonsense regulation changes on development through 2026.
Worse, it expanded the area affected to list 10 specific counties that had to wear the Legislature’s handcuffs: Charlotte, Collier, DeSoto, Glades, Hardee, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota.
DeSantis signed that one into law as well. Call that strike two.
Then came this year’s session and SB 180. The guv hasn’t put pen to paper on this one, so we can’t call it strike three — yet.
Some groups, such as Volusia and Miami-Dade counties, are urging him to veto it.
  Mayor Daniella Levine Cava via Miami-Dade County
The bill will “not only limit our ability to responsibly manage development, flooding, and ensure public safety … but also could expose local governments to attorney’s fees and costly litigation if local government regulations, enacted in good faith, are challenged,” Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava wrote to the governor this week.
“This legislation prevents local governments from enacting changes that may help our citizens in future storm events,” the Volusia County Council wrote to him in its own veto letter.
But I doubt DeSantis will listen to them, because this bill benefits developers. Our governor loves developers even more than he loves eating pudding while wearing his white go-go boots.
 The hungry seagull
Operator, I asked around about who was behind this bill. The word in Tallahassee is that its major proponent is a big-time developer in Manatee County named Pat Neal.
Neal is a former legislator who’s built 25,000 homes in Florida, most of them in Manatee and Sarasota counties. He’s now a billionaire, according to Forbes magazine, but compares himself a hungry seagull — and not the touchy-feely Jonathan Livingston kind.
“I have the right to swoop down on any chicken bone,” he told the magazine proudly. That’s not a motto you’d hear from someone who’s much concerned about the fate of his fellow man.
Thus, even though the Florida housing market seems to be headed for another crash with all the rapidity of a competitor in a demolition derby, Neal plans to keep building more and more homes. It’s what he’s been doing since the ’70s, and as the ’70s soul duo McFadden & Whitehead would say, “Ain’t no stopping him now.”
However, the Manatee County Commission, alarmed by flooding from last year’s hurricanes, has proposed a development moratorium while they figure out how to build subdivisions and other projects that will drain better.
Neal has been one of the more vocal opponents of a development moratorium, and his opinion does carry a lot of weight. He’s a guy for whom public officials tend to do favors.
For instance, 10 years ago I watched in open-mouthed wonder as the members of the Southwest Florida Water Management District board did Neal a huge favor. They did so despite the fact that it went against a judge’s ruling and they did it over the strong objections of environmental activists.
Now that the Legislature has said no local government can pass any “burdensome” post-storm regulations, the Manatee moratorium has been murdered in its crib. All you little Floridians must kneel to Neal and his needs! Give him all your chicken bones!
I tried reaching Neal to ask him about this, but he didn’t respond. Perhaps he was too busy squelching other good ideas for coping with the increasing intensity of Florida’s hurricanes.
If this bill becomes law, all the folks buying Neal-built homes will be just as much at risk of flooding as they were last year and the years before that, too.
But more importantly, Neal will still make money and spend his spare time contemplating his legacy.
“We want to make sure that what we leave behind is authentic and good,” he told Forbes. I hope someone will point out to him that homes he considers “authentic and good” won’t stay that way if they turn soggy with the next big storm surge and fill up with mold.
The larger problem, dear operator, is that Manatee County was far from the only place in hurricane-ravaged Florida where officials were talking about imposing new building regulations.
 Coping with the coops
Just down the road from Manatee, over in Polk County, the county commissioners were considering new stormwater requirements for developments in stressed basins, as well as some other changes.
Not anymore.
Here was the headline in the Lakeland Ledger: “Polk County delays vote on roosters, chicken coops and development issues over pending state bill.”
The chicken coop line is no yolk (sorry!). Polk commissioners had been considering new restrictions on where homeowners can keep their chickens.
But because DiCeglie’s bill passed, it’s Polk County that’s cooped up with its existing regulations. Polk’s commissioners voted to hold off taking any action until they see what DeSantis will do.
But that’s not as big an impact as what’s happening in New Smyrna Beach.
Back in 2022, after Ian passed through, the town of New Smyrna Beach first proposed a moratorium on growth. In those days, you almost never heard the M-word in Florida. But the folks in New Smyrna Beach were desperate.
During Ian’s onslaught, the city experienced “close to 21 inches of rain and 4 feet of storm surge in some areas,” the Daytona Beach News Journal reported. “County and city first responders rescued about 215 individuals as a result of the flooding, while over 850 homes suffered catastrophic damage to their properties.”
That was followed in 2023 by two non-hurricane storms that caused serious street flooding in a section of town called Venetian Bay. Major roads were impassable for days on end. Residents demanded the city do something.
That led to a moratorium on building permits pending work on fixing the drainage system. The city also passed new stormwater regulations in February. But all that will go away if DeSantis signs SB 180.
As a result, city officials have written to the governor urging him to veto the bill, and they’re encouraging all of New Smyrna’s 32,000 residents to do the same. I sure hope they fill up DeSantis’ inbox with urgent pleas for him to pay attention to this issue.
So, tell me, operator, can you help us all out? Send over some paramedics or even some cops to handle these self-destructive lawmakers? Help them to recover their sense of who they’re supposed to serve?
Because if not, all of us residents are likely to need some really urgent aid around the time the first big storm hits.

Mike Braun’s second-in-command, along with a key executive branch agency, pointed to a lack of planning under Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration as the reason hungry Hoosier schoolchildren won’t be able to use a summer meals program. 
“The previous administration did not file for SUN Bucks in the way they should have,” Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith told a crowd at a Zionsville town hall on Tuesday. “I’m working with Gov. Braun to get those SUN Bucks dollars back.”
‘A giant leap backwards’: Indiana opts out of summer program for hungry schoolchildren

That “lapse,” along with other perceived failures of Holcomb, were part of what propelled the duo into office, Beckwith continued. 
Last year, 669,000 Hoosier children who qualified for food benefits and reduced-price school meals got an additional $120 while schools were closed for the summer, for a total of roughly $80 million. But Indiana opted out of the program this year, saying that Holcomb’s administration hadn’t done the legwork in advance of 2025. 
Oversight costs for the program would be roughly $3.7 million for the state, according to the administration, a tough sell following the state’s projected $2 billion revenue shortfall earlier this year. In response, budget writers trimmed nearly every agency by 5% and sharply cut into economic development and public health programs.
“The successful implementation of the SUN Bucks program required early planning and strategic coordination to launch in Summer 2025. To ensure a timely rollout, the Division of Family Resources (DFR) needed clear direction from state leadership during late summer to early fall of 2024, during the prior administration,” Marcus Barlow told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
Barlow is the deputy chief of staff and director of the office of Strategic Communications and Public Affairs for the Family and Social Services Administration, which administers the program alongside the Department of Education. 
He said “due to the complexity of procurement processes and system enhancements,” the Holcomb administration should have done the following before 2025, which is when Braun took office:

Finalize contract amendments with the Electronic Benefit Transfer processor to allocate funding for Summer EBT
Secure a system vendor to support technical enhancements and application processing for 2025

Summer EBT, or S-EBT, is the official name for the SUN Bucks program. The Food and Nutrition Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, handles the program at the federal level.
 More details

It’s unclear what changed between the program’s administration in 2024 and 2025 that necessitated such changes. In response to a follow-up question, Barlow noted that “since that prior administration didn’t move forward, no decisions were made regarding whether or not to use the same vendor.” 
“Upon taking office, this administration quickly submitted a waiver application to the Food and Nutrition Service to explore all possible avenues for launching the program this summer. However, our review revealed that the gaps in prior preparations prevented implementation in time for Summer 2025,” Barlow said. 
That waiver application, dated for March 2025, appeared to indicate that the state was moving forward with the program and would be submitting a Plan for Operations and Management for approval under Braun’s administration. 
However, Barlow didn’t respond to further questions about that plan and whether it was submitted or approved, saying the Indiana Capital Chronicle would need to submit a records request for the document.
The federal government also declined to share a copy of Indiana’s plan or comment on whether it was submitted or approved. 
“USDA Secretary (Brooke) Rollins believes in empowering states to tailor programs and policies to their specific circumstances, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach. She recognizes that states are best equipped to understand their own populations and encourages them to explore innovative ideas to address their unique needs. Under Secretary Rollins, USDA is committed to engaging with Indiana to find bold and sustainable solutions that support and protect both participants and taxpayers,” a USDA spokesperson said.
 What to do this summer

Barlow pointed to existing resources under the USDA’s Site Finder Map and the Hunger Hotline for families to connect to food resources. The hotline is accessible Monday through Friday between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. Eastern Time at 1-866-3-HUNGRY (1-866-348-6479) for English speakers or at 1-877-8-HAMBRE (1-877-842-6273) for Spanish speakers.

At the Tuesday town hall, the devout Beckwith continued on the topic of summer meals by saying that the state should “take advantage” of the federal money being offered.
“We should go after that federal money,” Beckwith said to cheers. “It’s just going to go to a different state.”
Additionally, the Noblesville pastor asked the faith community to step up in place of the state to “be the hands and feet of Christ in these communities” this summer.
“I don’t think the state is equipped to do it as well as nonprofits,” Beckwith concluded. “… It’s a nonprofit’s (and) faith community’s job to do it. They can do it better than the state (and) far more efficiently.”

(Rendering courtesy of JBS) JBS announced plans Thursday to build a $135 million sausage-production facility that will create more than 700 jobs in Perry. 
Cameron Bruett, head of corporate affairs for the company, said the facility will be “state of the art” and that “there’s gonna be nothing like it” in America. 
“This would probably be the first facility of its kind built in the last 40 years. And so that’s exciting for us to be a new entrant, a new competitor, in a growing space in agriculture,” Bruett said in a call with Iowa Capital Dispatch. 
The announcement comes nearly a year after the shuttering of a Tyson Foods pork processing facility in Perry that employed nearly 1,300 people.

Bruett, who was in Perry Wednesday along with other members of JBS senior staff, said the reception to the project has been overwhelmingly positive. 
“We think that this could have a long-term positive impact on the community over the next 50 to 100 years, if we do this right,” Bruett said. “And it’s a community that I think is ready for a project like this, and, frankly, needs a project like this.” 
The new facility will have 500 direct positions. While it doesn’t fill the 1,300-slot hole left in Perry by Tyson’s departure, Bruett said he believes there will be “ample opportunity” for former Tyson employees in town to find work at the new facility. 
Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh said at the time of the Tyson plant closure he was unsure how the town of about 8,000 would recover from the closure and loss of jobs. 
Following the news from JBS, Cavanaugh. said the project was a “potential game-changer” for Perry. 
“JBS USA’s intentions to invest here reflects the resilience and promise of our community,” Cavanaugh said in a statement. “This facility will not only create good-paying jobs but also provide long-term benefits for our schools, infrastructure, and local businesses.” 
Bruett was unable to share wage ranges for the jobs the facility, if approved, would provide. He said the starting salary for other JBS facilities in Iowa is about $22 per hour and the Perry site would be comparable. 
JBS also anticipates the construction of the facility will require around 250 local construction jobs, starting in 2025 when it hopes to begin building. The company expects the facility will be operational in late 2026. 
The sausage-making facility would process around 500,000 sows to create 130 million pounds of sausage each year. 
Bruett said the facility will create an additional outlet for local pork producers who currently transport most of their sows east for processing. 
Aaron Juergens, president of Iowa Pork Producers Association said he was excited to see the proposal from JBS and the opportunities it would bring for pork producers in the state. 
“It strengthens our state’s leadership in pork production, creates new opportunities for pork producers, and supports the rural communities that are the backbone of Iowa agriculture,” Juergen said. “This is a win for pig farmers, Iowa’s economy, and for the Perry area.”
Additionally, JBS plans to invest in the Perry community through its Hometown Strong and Better Futures programs which fund projects in the community and help JBS team members and their family members attend community colleges. 
“We believe in giving back to the communities we call home,” Wesley Batista Filho, CEO of JBS USA, said in a statement. “Our investments in Perry will go beyond dollars — they will help build careers, strengthen families, and ensure a thriving community for generations to come.”
JBS will submit a request to the City of Perry to change the zoning for the property, located on the southeast side of town, from agricultural to heavy industrial, according to Bruett. The city council will have to approve the project before it can begin construction.

(Getty Images)Roughly 45,000 Minnesotans would be at risk of losing all of their federal food assistance, and tens of thousands more could lose some of that assistance under cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) approved by Republicans in the U.S. House. The bill still needs to pass the Senate and win the signature of President Donald Trump to become law. 
All told, 11 million people nationwide would be at risk of losing some food aid under the $230 billion in cuts approved by House Republicans, according to a recent estimate by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. That money would be used instead to partially fund tax cuts that mostly benefit the rich.
“One of the harshest cuts would take food assistance away from people — including, for the first time ever, parents with children over the age of 6 and adults aged 55 to 64 — who don’t meet a red-tape-laden and ineffective work requirement,” the CBPP writes.
Studies have consistently shown that those work requirements do not actually boost employment.
Minnesota has relatively low SNAP participation compared to other states, so the cuts won’t bite as sharply here as they would elsewhere. They’d be distributed more or less evenly across the state’s eight congressional districts, with between 4,000 and 6,000 people in each district at risk of losing benefits completely.
Districts in more impoverished regions of the country, like Appalachia, the deep South, and parts of the Southwest, would see tens of thousands of adult residents at risk of a total loss of benefits.
The severity of the final cuts will depend in part on whether affected states can fill gaps with state funding. Even a relatively small funding gap in Minnesota could wreak havoc on the state’s budget, which lawmakers are currently working to finalize.
Roughly 440,000 Minnesotans currently rely on SNAP, according to data from the Department of Children, Youth and Families, including 50,000 children under the age of 6.
“Food insecurity is directly linked to higher rates of chronic conditions,” the agency warns. “Without SNAP, more vulnerable Minnesotans will go without consistent access to food, increasing the strain on an already stretched health system.”
A 2022 study by researchers at the Department of Human Services found that for every additional month a recipient received SNAP benefits, their annual health care costs decreased by roughly $99.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-05-29 07:01:40.184959

Justin Sparks (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). A new lawsuit filed by the Missouri NAACP accuses Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey of failing to follow state law last year when the annual vehicle stops report omitted data that shows whether minority motorists are being stopped more frequently than white drivers.
Filed Tuesday in Cole County, the lawsuit also accuses Bailey and the University of Missouri of violating the state Sunshine Law by withholding documents showing why the information called a disparity index was left out of the report on stops during 2023 and whether it was calculated at all.
The lawsuit was filed just days before the report for stops in 2024 is due on Sunday.
The disparity index is a ratio of stops among an identifiable group compared to their share of the population of driving age. If the ratio is one, it means that traffic stops in that particular group align with their share of the whole.
Bailey “has an absolute, statutory and ministerial duty, pursuant to (state law), to include a ‘disparity index,’ that is a comparison of the percentage of stopped motor vehicles driven by each minority group and the percentage of the state’s population that each minority group comprises, in his annual report,” the lawsuit states.
In the executive summary of the report issued June 1, 2024, the omission was explained as a decision to stop using a data point of questionable value and sometimes incorrect interpretation.
A disparity index of two for any minority group, the summary states, means very different things in a community where 10% of the population are members of that group compared to a community where 50% of the population are members of that group.
“The (vehicle stops report) already provides detailed information on traffic stops and rates relative to subgroup population, so no new objective information is provided by calculating the index,” the summary states.
 Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel Jr. speaks during a May 15 rally on the Missouri Capitol steps (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
But Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP and a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said questions about the usefulness of a data point are not enough to excuse ignoring the law that requires it.
“The requirements of the statute are clear, there shall be a disparity index that is produced by the attorney general,” he said. “Last year, Attorney General Bailey recognized that, I think, in his summary, and chose not to do it.”
For the state as a whole, the report for 2023 shows, 538 police agencies made almost 1.4 million traffic stops, issued almost 570,000 citations and made 57,713 arrests. White motorists accounted for 77% of the stops, another 17.3% of the motorists were Black and 3.1% were Hispanic.
The Independent calculated a disparity index that showed the index for white drivers was 0.97 while the index for black drivers was 1.59. For Hispanic drivers, the disparity index was 0.8, indicating stops in smaller numbers than their portion of the population. Those figures are similar to what past reports showed. 
In the lawsuit, the NAACP is asking for an order directing Bailey to publish the disparity index calculations for the state as a whole and for the 538 police agencies that submitted reports on their traffic stops. The lawsuit also asks for an order stating he has a statutory obligation to include it in future reports and to turn over records requested last year regarding the decision to omit the index.
The Sunshine Law violations alleged in the lawsuit state that the last communication from the attorney general’s office regarding a Nov. 13 request for records was Feb. 26. Bailey’s office said records would be ready in a week but has not delivered them, the lawsuit states.
The University of Missouri performed calculations presented in the report, and the NAACP sought records regarding those calculations and the decision not to include the index. On May 16, the university, after taking six months, delivered 443,000 documents. But it also said, according to the lawsuit, that “many of the records identified in response to your search criteria have been withheld” under Sunshine Law provisions allowing records to be closed. 
One of the exemptions cited is that the withheld records were related to legal actions or litigation or confidential or privileged communications with attorneys. In the court filing, the NAACP says that claim is a ruse because, other than the lawsuit filed Tuesday, the University of Missouri is “not involved in legal actions, causes of action or litigation involving the requested documents.”
Bailey’s office said it would not comment on the lawsuit. 
University of Missouri spokesman Christopher Ave, in an email, said “we deny liability for the violation alleged in this case and plan to present our defenses in court.”
The vehicle stops report has been published since 2000 under a law intended to detect and prevent racial profiling of motorists. The data reported has been refined over the years, including the disparity index.
The most recent version of the disparity index, before it was discontinued, was calculated based on total stops within a jurisdiction and for stops of motorists who reside within that jurisdiction.
That is an improvement in the data, Chapel said, because it shows whether minority visitors to tourist areas are being stopped in greater numbers than the resident population. The NAACP travel advisory for Missouri issued in 2017 used data from the vehicle stops reports to state that “African Americans are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped and searched based on skin color than Caucasians.”
The allegation is supported by data on stops that result in discovery of contraband, Chapel said.
“If you look at most of the data, it says that black and brown people get stopped more than anybody else, but the rate at which they’re found with contraband is lower,” Chapel said. “So that would say that we are misusing community resources in a way that is not effective.”
In 2023, 25.5% of white drivers stopped had contraband, compared to 20.5% for Black drivers and 16.3% for Hispanic drivers. Black and Hispanic drivers were, however, much more likely to receive a citation after the stop, with 38.2% of white drivers stopped receiving a ticket, compared to 55.2% for Black drivers and 50.4% for Hispanic drivers.
Don Love of Columbia, who has been analyzing the annual vehicle stops reports for more than a decade, said that he dislikes the disparity index because it is an imprecise measure of officer motives for a stop.
He’s argued for a new method to replace it.
“What they did wasn’t replace it, but just to leave it out entirely,” Love said. “It wasn’t good, but it’s illegal for them not to have it in there.”
The use of ratios to analyze the data should be expanded, he said, to cover other data in the report, including the number of drivers searched, the contraband found and the arrests made, as well as whether drivers get a citation or just a warning.
Breaking the stop data into resident and non-resident stops added a new dimension to the data, Love said.
“If you look at what happens for Black drivers when they leave their home jurisdictions and go someplace else, there’s something more than two times the white rate,” he said.
Omitting the disparity index was not done without thought, Chapel said. The lawsuit is intended to discover the motive and prove that the law requires it as part of the report, he added.
“There’s any number of things that the attorney general is supposed to do,” Chapel said, “and if he’s just making the decision not to do it, we deserve to know.”

Aallyah Wright, a Clarksdale native and former staff reporter at Mississippi Today, is Capital B’s rural issues reporter.

When Jaleesa Collins discovered that Sinners was set in her hometown, she saw it as a great opportunity to organize a public screening.
The military veteran, philanthropist and entrepreneur — along with Dave “Dooney” Houston, owner of Dooney’s Barbershop and Carnival Treats — originally pitched the idea as a fundraiser for the first-ever Clarksdale Day, the committee of which they serve on. The three-day event, set for Labor Day weekend, plans to unify the town and celebrate local culture through activities such as a parade, car show, award ceremony and barbecue competition.
The idea sparked conversation across Facebook.
Following that, Tyler Yarbrough, a community organizer and Clarksdale native, jumped into action and launched an open letter to Sinners’ director Ryan Coogler expressing his desire to host a screening and facilitate conversations.
After much discussion, Warner Bros. Pictures, the distribution company for Sinners, announced it will host multiple public screenings of the film May 29 through May 31 in the majority Black city of 14,000. On May 29, Coogler will visit the town and enjoy a screening in downtown Clarksdale. Following the screening, there will be Q&A with Coogler, Ludwig Göransson, the film’s composer, and actor Miles Caton. Also attending are Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian, who are producers for Proximity Media, and executive music producer Serena Göransson.
This event is part of Clarksdale Culture Capital, a three-day festival that includes “dynamic panels featuring local Clarksdalians, historians, artists, cultural workers, and musicians, anchoring the film in the soil it came from and uplifting the voices who live and breathe this region’s truths every day,” according to a news release. For the full schedule and ticket information, visit this website.
“There’s a groundswell of activity happening in Clarksdale, that’s burbling up from the ancestral soil that is known as the Delta. This moment is bigger than myself, bigger than Sinners, it’s about pride and ownership, and love,” Yarbrough said in a statement. “We’re bringing that to life, leveraging the premier of Sinners in Clarksdale, but we’re also very interested in keeping the microphone on Clarksdale now and in the future.”
Mayor Chuck Espy of Clarksdale said in a statement that this moment for Clarksdale “signals that the Delta’s creative power, history, and people are not just worth watching, but investing in.”
In Clarksdale — the birthplace of the blues — there’s no active movie theater. Despite that, several residents told Capital B it’s important for filmmakers who are inspired by the town’s history to be intentional about creating opportunities and giving back to the community in meaningful ways.
“I’m just happy to see how far this has gone — from just the start of an ideal to transforming action into opportunity, and now we’re at the end state of making this a reality,” said Collins, who is also on the planning committee to help the event come to fruition. “I’m all about culture. I’m all about art … and we’re bridging the gap and bringing all of that together.”
Since Capital B first-reported the story, there have been national conversations across several social media platforms and media hits from CNN and USA Today to The Breakfast Club, leading executives of Warner Bros. to reach out directly to Yarbrough.
Collins and Houston hope this screening will present an opportunity for attendees to support local businesses and create opportunities for the local community. Additionally, they want the events to empower Clarksdale residents to work together and create a better future for the present and future generations.
“Clarksdale is on its way back, but it ain’t coming back in a form that the older generations like my mom and dad saw it. It’s coming back through arts, culture, and film,” Houston said. “We got a voice out there in the world, and we need to promote it. We’re the people trying to save our city.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28194434/AP25104706150811.jpg,,,2025-05-29 07:59:49.234194

Two Hoback residents filed a complaint in federal court arguing the fees that go toward workforce and affordable housing are ‘unconstitutional.’
The post Teton County’s development fees face legal challenge appeared first on WyoFile .","Two Hoback residents are suing Teton County in federal court for what they claim are unlawful development fees.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of a legislative session ripe with bills that targeted the county’s fees, which are intended to offset the impacts development has on affordable housing.  
Shelby and Trey Scharp filed the complaint because they don’t believe they should have to subsidize the county’s affordable housing program for “problems they didn’t create.” 
It’s not news that Teton County has one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. One contributing factor is that jobs far outpace available housing. The county is only adding new units at half the rate of jobs, which is still better than the surrounding area. Even then, many units in town are often priced at rates unattainable for much of the local workforce.
The couple currently lives in a cabin near Hoback Junction, south of Jackson. Both have been dude ranch managers at Flat Creek Ranch, an hour’s drive north of Jackson, for the last two decades. 
The Scharps have plans to construct an on-site single-family home, with the goal of turning the cabin into a rental unit, according to a press release from the law firm representing the couple. 
Before they could get the permit for the new building, the Scharps had to pay a $24,325 fee that goes toward the county’s workforce and affordable housing mitigation efforts. 
The complaint argues this fee is unconstitutional, according to the Pacific Legal Foundation attorney, David Deerson, representing the Scharps free of charge. 
“The Scharps didn’t create the affordable housing problem in Teton County. In fact, they’re helping to solve it by building new units and adding new supply,” Deerson said. 
His firm has settled previous lawsuits against similar housing fees, including a 2024 case in the Sonoma County, California, town of Healdsburg. 
KHOL reached out to the Scharps through their attorney but didn’t immediately hear back.  
Teton County had not yet been served with the complaint when reached for comment.
The county attorney referred to its most recent “nexus study” in a statement, which determines how much property owners like the Scharps have to pay in housing fees to get new building permits. The “nexus study” says it uses publicly available data to provide “a technically robust and legally defensible fee program” linking new development to the creation of new jobs that will require workers, who will need to be housed.
The residential fee is assessed on a combination of factors, including the number of new housing units a project builds compared to the number of units needed in the area. 
“Teton County strongly stands by our most recent affordable housing nexus study completed in 2023,” Chief Deputy County Attorney Keith Gingery said in an email. “The county’s adoption of affordable housing mitigation fees is fully compliant with all constitutional provisions requiring an essential nexus and proportionality.”
Mark Newcomb, chair of the Board of County Commissioners, declined to comment for now and referred KHOL to Gingery’s statement. 
“I will defend it rigorously through the court process.” Richard “Dick” Stout, Teton County attorney
This isn’t the first time the county’s program has been challenged. It faced a battle in the Wyoming Legislature earlier this year, with members of the Freedom Caucus writing an amendment that would have barred the town and county from requiring the mitigation fees, though it ultimately failed.
The bill, Senate File 40, had the backing of several prominent Teton County Republicans, including Rebecca Bextel, who recently lost her bid for state GOP chair. 
“I feel confident in the legal footing we have and if we need to defend it, we will stand up and defend it,” County Commissioner Natalia Macker previously told KHOL in a March interview. 
The county’s prosecuting attorney, Richard “Dick” Stout, said he also believes the housing program fees are constitutional.
“I will defend it rigorously through the court process,” Stout said in a text message.

My strongest memory of Bond was his pursuit as the Republican gubernatorial candidate to replace the Democratic governor who controlled a legislature dominated by Democrats.
He began his election campaign critical of Democrats, until, as I was told, Republican Attorney General Jack Danforth advised Bond to put more focus on issues of importance to Missourians.
I suspect that was a factor in Bond’s subsequent policy-focused agenda, which led his lasting legacy and the frequent description of Bond as a moderate.
Bond’s successful agenda included consumer protection, campaign finance disclosure requirements, expanding education programs for children, the Sunshine Law providing public access to government records and reforming state government hiring.
Bond’s focus on consumer protection issues was not surprising since he served as Danforth’s consumer protection director.
Bond went further in his bipartisan approach, crossing conservative Republican lines when he supported Missouri ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (which ultimately failed).
His cross-party agenda came under dramatic attack from a few fellow statehouse Republicans. The most vivid demonstration of the split between Bond and his party came from long-time Carthage Republican state Sen. Richard Webster.
Angered by some of Bond’s gubernatorial staff and proposals, Webster attacked Bond’s staff on the Senate floor.
Webster coined the phrase “kiddie corps,” which he used in his Senate attacks to describe Bond’s staff as brash younger folks, not sufficiently conservative for Webster.
Webster’s attack reflected the views from some Republicans who had hoped for a new Republican-focused conservative agenda without a Democratic governor.
It was not to be.
I do not recall Bond ever wavering from his agenda.
Instead, Bond pursued issues that could win bipartisan support, including moderate Senate Republicans.
I still miss that era when a partnership with Bond, Democrats and moderate Republicans dominated public policy in the legislature.
Bond demonstrated his cross-party support for major issues when, after leaving the U.S. Senate, he returned to state government on behalf the Missouri Chamber of Commerce to support Medicaid expansion.
Facing stiff statehouse GOP opposition, Bond’s efforts failed in the legislature. But it was eventually enacted by initiative petition.
But it was another demonstration about how Bond could cross ideological and political boundaries for an issue he felt was important for our state.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052025_kitbond2-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-29 07:01:40.184959

(Photo courtesy of Aqeela Sherrills)Community-based violence intervention programs nationwide have long worked alongside law enforcement officers to deescalate conflict, prevent retaliatory shootings and, in some cases, arrive at crime scenes before police do.
In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Feds’ funding cuts ‘will get people killed,’ attorney general says

Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
 ‘Wasteful grants’

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
 Impact on communities nationwide

In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

Beau Beaullieu has updated his proposal to change state ethics laws concerning gifts to public officials. (Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers are no longer looking to broadly lift restrictions on gifts to elected officials and public employees while doing their jobs, but they appear intent on discouraging ethics investigations.

Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-Iberia, removed language from House Bill 674 that would have allowed public servants to receive $200 worth of gifts annually. This would have applied to all local and state government employees, from a local police officer to the governor. 
Instead, Beaullieu has rewritten the legislation to keep a portion of a current limitation on government worker gifts in place. Now, gifts that aren’t food would be mostly restricted to $200 worth of flowers or a charitable donation to express sympathy for a family death. 

New allowances for “seasonal” food and beverages remain in the legislation, however. Under current law, most public officials are not supposed to receive food and drink as gifts unless it’s at a party or reception. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under existing rules, they have to consume the food in person at the event where it is given. The edible gift can cost no more than $79 per person, a cutoff the Louisiana Board of Ethics adjusts every year based on the Consumer Price Index. 

Beaullieu’s updated proposal would allow elected leaders and public employees to take seasonal or holiday foods as gifts for a religious or state holiday, even outside of a party or reception. The cap on food gifts would also be $79 per person per holiday or whatever new price the ethics board adopts in future years. 
Besides the gift policy changes, Beaullieu’s bill contains several ethics law modifications that would make it much harder for the state ethics board to investigate and charge people with misconduct. 

The ethics board oversees enforcement of campaign finance laws and the state ethics code for public employees, elected officials and lobbyists. Anyone from a public school teacher to the governor can be subject of one of its investigations. 

The adjustments Beaullieu proposes would require more members of the ethics board to vote in favor of  pursuing an investigation and give the board far less time to decide whether a person should be charged with ethical wrongdoing. People accused of ethics violations would also have more ability to push back on the allegations under Beaullieu’s bill. 
If the legislation were to pass, the new standards that would have to be met in order for the ethics board to launch an investigation would be very difficult to achieve. For example, the ethics board would have to be confident that wrongdoing had occurred in order to sign off on any preliminary probe into the alleged misconduct. 

Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said earlier this month the process Beaullieu seeks would “skew” the process in favor of the public servant accused of wrongdoing. He also took issue with a new restriction Beaullieu proposed Tuesday on ethical investigations and charges. The state representative added language to his bill prohibiting the ethics board from launching an investigation based on information it received through an advisory opinion request. 
The board is frequently asked to explain how ethics laws apply in specific situations through advisory opinions. It issues at least a few of these public letters monthly providing feedback. 
“If someone submits an advisory opinion request that indicates a violation has already occurred, it should be within the board’s prerogative to initiate an investigation of that,” Bordelon told senators at a committee hearing Tuesday. 
Beaullieu said he is trying to overhaul state ethics investigations because many elected officials feel the board has been too aggressive when pursuing allegations. 
The state’s preeminent state government watchdog, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, has come out strongly against the bill. 

“This is designed to make sure we don’t have ethics investigations,” Steven Procopio, the organization’s president, said of the proposed changes. 
The legislation is backed by Gov. Jeff Landry, who has had several personal conflicts with the ethics board over his nine years in statewide office.
In 2023, the board charged Landry in 2023 with the ethics violation of failing to disclose flights he took on a political donor’s private plane to Hawaii for an attorneys general conference. That dispute is ongoing because the governor and board members have not reached an agreement on what Landry’s punishment for the violation should be. 
Stephen Gelé, the attorney representing Landry in this ethics dispute, also helped write Beaullieu’s legislation to overhaul the state’s ethics laws. 
The Louisiana Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the bill Tuesday with no objections. An earlier version of the proposal also passed the Louisiana House unanimously, but both the Senate and the House will have to approve the amended version before it can become law. 

It must pass by the Louisiana Legislature’s session adjournment June 12.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The Rice Lake office and an office in Mounds View, Minn., are both operated by the USGS Upper Midwest Water Science Center. They are among the more than two dozen offices across the country DOGE has targeted for closure, according to Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. 
USGS staff and environmental policy workers across Wisconsin say closing  the office in Rice Lake could harm the quality and quantity of the data available in the state — making it harder for local, county and state governments, as well as private citizens and businesses, to make plans and policies in a region that will be at more risk of both drought and extreme weather events as climate change intensifies. 
The USGS water science centers operate thousands of streamgages across the country, gathering data on stream flows and water quality. That data can be used to help design plans for infrastructure such as bridges and dams; inform research on pollutants such as nitrates and pesticides; help farmers set irrigation plans during droughts; give homeowners information on flood plains and support recreational industries such as whitewater rafting. 
“The Rice Lake office is just a very important but small piece of what they do, and what they do is so fundamental to what so many other people are trying to do across so many sectors in the state of Wisconsin,” says Erin O’Brien, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Wetlands Association. “They support state agencies and local communities and others doing not just land and water conservation work, but development and transportation planning and all these other sectors.” 
The agency has been operating streamgages in the United States since the 1880s. One of the first 120 gages the agency installed was in Wisconsin in 1899, according to USGS data. That longevity gives scientists an essential resource for tracking Wisconsin’s bodies of water. It’s easier to understand the effect of a 100-year flood when you’re working with more than a century of data. 
Each individual streamgage increases the value of the entire network, and every additional year of data further improves the data. Many practical uses of the data to understand how rivers and watersheds are functioning require 20 years of measurements, according to a 2021 report on the USGS streamgage network by the Congressional Research Service. 
At a field office such as the one in Rice Lake, the staff is responsible for maintaining and repairing the gages. The risk of closing an office is that the staff won’t be close enough to do that work, resulting in lower quality data, according to Paul LaLiberte, who serves as the chair of Wisconsin Green Fire’s Environmental Rules and Water Resources Work Group. LaLiberte worked on water quality issues for 36 years at the state Department of Natural Resources. 
“This flow data is continually recording, and [the field offices are] the ones that install the equipment, maintain the equipment, and, importantly, go out and calibrate it on a schedule and even in response to events,” says LaLiberte, who worked with staff in the Rice Lake office when he was based in Eau Claire with the DNR. 
“By closing the field offices, that’s going to make it a whole lot harder to do this calibration and maintenance and even run as many stations as they do,” he said. “The consequences will probably be some combination of dropping some stations or having the data be less accurate, because due to travel times, they just can’t send the crews out there to recalibrate the stations. So if the data is less accurate, then the predictions are going to be less accurate, and the infrastructure designs associated with that are going to be less accurate.”
One USGS staff member who works outside of Wisconsin, granted anonymity because agency employees have not been authorized to speak to the media, says staff members across the country weren’t aware their offices were being shut down until the General Services Administration told their landlords the leases would not be renewed. 
The staffer says the terminations are “shocking” because these offices are filled with lab equipment that is difficult to move and there are still not yet plans for alternatives. The result is that the data won’t be collected. 
“I guess maybe this is apparent, but leaving these leases was not a strategy for efficiency,” the staffer says. “There’s no plan in place to leave these facilities and find other alternatives. And it’s a huge effort to now create a plan to find alternatives for these facilities when you know these facilities are in full use, and we don’t see any other options. We will not be able to collect the data that we need to fulfill our mission, because we will be reassigning resources to deal with moving that we don’t have.” 
A USGS spokesperson said in a statement the terminated leases will not harm the agency’s mission. 
“USGS remains committed to its congressional mandate as the science arm of the Department of the Interior,” the spokesperson said. “We are actively working with GSA to ensure that every facility and asset is utilized effectively, and where necessary, identifying alternative solutions that strengthen our mission. These efforts reflect our broader commitment to streamlining government operations while ensuring that scientific endeavors remain strong, effective, and impactful. This process is ongoing, and we will provide updates as more information becomes available.”
The Rice Lake office’s lease is set to end July 31, 2026.

But there's 90 days to decide. (Getty Images)Idaho is switching contractors that run health insurance plans for vulnerable patients.
Starting June 1, the private health insurance companies running Idaho Medicaid and Medicare’s plans will change to Molina Healthcare and UnitedHealthcare.
That will only apply to the about 27,000 Idahoans who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, said Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter. Over half of them were already enrolled in an insurance plan run by a private company, called managed care.
People dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid qualify for disabilities, low income and age. 
Many patients have already been automatically enrolled in one of the new duals insurance plans. But patients will have 90 days, or until Aug. 30, to pick, McWhorter told the Sun in an email.
Only 2,000 people chose a specific insurance plan so far, after Health and Welfare sent out letters in March, he said on May 22. 
“Many people haven’t chosen a new plan because they like the plan they will be enrolled in if they do not make a selection. But we want to be sure that everyone who wants to make an active choice does so,” he said.
Idaho’s dual Medicaid and Medicare offers two types of plans.

 How the new Idaho Medicaid duals contracts work

For people dually eligible, Medicaid generally covers costs not fully covered by Medicare, such as for nursing homes and home and community-based services, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Both of the new Idaho companies, Molina and United, will be required to honor existing patient authorizations for the first 90 days of the contract, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare says. 
Health and Welfare is winding down readiness reviews of the new companies and hasn’t spotted any concerning issues, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron told the Idaho Capital Sun in a May 19 interview.
“Could there be bumps in the road? Of course,” she said. But that’s why she said Idaho officials are communicating proactively.
People who have questions or concerns should reach out to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, or United or Molina, she said.

 Idaho officials, companies resolved gap in duals contract

The health insurer Blue Cross of Idaho previously ran Idaho’s dual Medicaid and Medicare plans. Last year, Idaho went out for a competitive bid for the contract for the first time.
Initially, there was a six-month gap starting this June when Blue Cross’s contract ended and United would’ve started, Idaho Reports reported in January. But since then, Health and Welfare has worked with the new insurance companies to start June 1. One United plan is available starting Jan. 1, 2026.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)It may have been just a ceremonial signing but Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and advocates lauded two public safety bills Wednesday afternoon.
Braun signed Senate Enrolled Act 324 and House Enrolled Act 1014, both bills to protect Hoosier families as a part of his agenda, he said. 
“Keeping Hoosiers safe is our top priority, and we’ve secured several wins for public safety this session.” Braun said in a news release. “These bills will increase the penalty for pushing fentanyl on our streets, help keep police officers safe, and make our communities safer for Hoosier families.”
SEA 324, effective July 1, increases penalty levels for crimes involving fentanyl. It also states that a court must consider requiring a person charged with domestic violence to wear a monitoring device as a condition of bail. 
The bill hits close to home for one Indiana family — the Stoebick’s, who attended the bill signing after losing a loved one to domestic violence. 
Jessica Stoebick, a nurse at Riley Hospital for Children, was murdered by her ex-husband after a history of domestic abuse incidents on Dec. 18, 2023. 
Her mother, Bobbi Stoebick stood next to Braun as he signed the bill wearing a shirt that read ‘I wear purple for my daughter. Stop domestic violence.’ Jessica’s father and sister also attended. 
Bobbi Stoebick said she thinks that if her daughter’s ex-husband was wearing a ankle monitor, her daughter would have had more time to prepare herself. 
“It is baby steps,” She said after the signing. “Women live in fear everyday, it has to stop.” 
Braun also signed HEA 1014, which will restrict government entities from hosting or organizing obscene performances. 
“That’s just common sense,” Braun said about the bill. “It just isn’t what the government should be spending taxpayer dollars on.” 
During the legislative session, no examples were provided of any such instances.
The law also makes it a sentencing aggravator to be in the U.S. “unlawfully,” as well as having distributed a controlled substance. 
“There are no disruptions from the federal border,” Braun said. “Things are already getting better.”

“It is not unreasonable to want to feel safe at work and to have a voice in the procedures that impact us and our patients,” Dickmann continued. “It is not unreasonable to want fair compensation for our labor.

A management position paper distributed Wednesday by the hospital’s communications department asserted that the hospital and the union both “agree that staffing levels are a critical component to safe patient care.”
The paper stated that the hospital’s approach to staffing assignments needed “to remain flexible” so it could move personnel in response to “patient needs and census changes.” It said the hospital would review “the staffing matrix” in four units the union identified as having problems, and that nurses and support staff in the affected units would be included in the process.
At the union’s picket line rally on Tuesday, bargaining team member Amber Anderson said the management proposal fell short.
“Meriter management refuses to put staffing solutions in our contract,” Anderson said, calling the management proposal “a vague promise to review staffing with no timelines, no accountability and no enforceable standards. That is not enough.”
The union has also focused on security and on wages. Union proposals have sought  increases particularly for nurses with the longest tenure, as well as metal detectors in certain areas.
The management paper said average wages would go up by $4.67 an hour over the life of the agreement under the hospital’s proposal, and that Meriter had plans to install weapons screening equipment in its emergency department this summer.
At Wednesday’s picket line rally, striking nurses heard messages of support from Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Black Earth).
Pocan recalled his visit to Meriter for three clogged arteries seven and a half years ago.
“And I got time to spend in the ICU and other rooms here at Meritor, and I received excellent health care,” Pocan said. “Not because of the comfort of the bed or the colors of the wall, not because of the profitability of the hospital, but because of the staff and the nurses at Meriter.”
Johnson came to Madison because he sees issues in the strike as important “not just for nurses in Madison, but really for nurses all across the state of Wisconsin,” he said in an interview. “When you stand with labor, it’s not just a sometime thing, it’s an all the time thing.”
Strikers also got support from union activists organizing at other area health care employers.
“The people who own the health care industry are running a race to the bottom, where executives try to lower quality of care, increase ratios as much as they possibly can get away with,” said Colin Gillis, who has been active in the effort begun more than five years ago to win union representation for nurses at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics in Madison.
“And when they do it here, at the hospital next door, they look at their nurses and they say, ‘Hey, they take six patients at night, so can you,” Gillis said. “Well, you and your nurses are here to say, ‘Heck, No!’”
Dr. Ira Segal, who has been among the employees at Group Health Cooperative in Madison organizing a union, said his coworkers see the Meriter nurses as allies.
“Together, we will persevere and we will shape a future where workers and patients come before profit, and where every voice is heard,” Segal said.

Though the legal dispute may be quashed, both parties continue to point fingers. 
The post Wyoming GOP drops lawsuit against Laramie County clerk, but blame game continues appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Republican Party has settled its civil lawsuit against Laramie County Clerk Debra Lee over the testing of election equipment performed last year. 
The legal dispute began last August when the state GOP sued Lee for improperly testing ballot tabulators. The matter appeared to resolve itself fairly quickly when the parties reached an agreement and settled less than two weeks later. 
The issue, however, rekindled in October when the state party accused Lee of not fulfilling the obligations of that agreement. A Laramie County District Court judge was set to determine whether the clerk was in compliance when the state party chose to dismiss the complaint on May 23. 
Though the legal dispute may be quashed, both parties continue to point fingers. 
The state party maintains Lee “refused to provide the evidence of testing as directed by the court,” while the clerk contends that the state GOP’s “failure to meaningfully respond to our earlier offers needlessly dragged the case on for many months and continued to rack up thousands in legal bills.”

How we got here
Wyoming law requires county clerks to use test ballots to confirm the accuracy of electronic tabulating equipment at least two weeks before an election. 
Part of that involves the clerk assigning a different number of votes to each candidate for an office. The idea is to produce distinct results in order to confirm the accuracy of the machines.
“If candidates have the same number of votes, you can’t definitively say that the votes intended for that person were counted that way,” Malcolm Ervin, president of the County Clerks’ Association, previously told WyoFile.
But ahead of the 2024 primary election, several counties’ tests, including Laramie County, instead used the identical number of votes. 
As such, Secretary of State Chuck Gray sent an Aug. 12 letter asking local election officials to conduct retests. Several did so, including Laramie County on Aug. 13.
But by then, the lawsuit had already been filed and the state GOP had remaining concerns about the accuracy of the vote tabulators. That’s when Laramie County and the state GOP struck a compromise.
The day before the Aug. 20 election, they entered a consent decree — a court-approved settlement between parties that outlines the terms of the resolution. 
Part of that agreement included additional testing of Laramie County’s tabulation machines — both before and after the election — that extended beyond the statutory requirements. 
Test receipts
The consent decree also required Lee to provide certain documentation to the state GOP — which is where much of the legal dispute rested until last week. 
The agreement required the clerk to provide “a written statement describing any non-public testing conducted by the defendant of the DS200 tabulation machines, describing the date of such test, the parties conducting the test, and the nature of the test. Defendant shall, if available, provide the test deck summary sheets and the corresponding post-test receipts from the tabulation machines.”
Lee maintains that she met those requirements.

After entering the consent decree, Lee learned that there was no easily obtainable method of printing duplicate receipts from the tabulator machines, according to a prehearing memo prepared by Lee’s attorney and former Republican state lawmaker Tim Stubson.
The receipts in her possession “were on lengthy strands of thermal paper,” according to the memo, which raised “concerns that trying to copy those receipts could damage them and compromise the integrity of the official election records that must be retained and protected” by the clerk’s office. 
After Lee determined that a duplicate copy was not readily available, she notified the plaintiffs via her attorney and provided a statement to meet the requirements of the consent decree. 
“It is important to keep in mind that Clerk Lee made multiple offers to the plaintiffs to allow them to inspect the test receipts and if desired to even take pictures of the receipts for their records,” Stubson wrote. 
By the time the plaintiffs responded several weeks later, and “demanded that they be allowed to review the receipts,” they had been sealed, as is required by state law, and the tabulator machines had been cleared and readied for the general election. 
“The plain language of the consent decree contemplated that a statement could be provided in lieu of test receipts if they proved to be unavailable,” the memo states. “That is exactly what happened here.”
The plaintiffs disagree. More specifically, the state GOP argued in its own filings that Lee failed to provide the specific information required by the consent decree and, as such, was in contempt of court. 
The test receipts were sought “because there were genuine concerns as to whether or not [the] defendant had ever tested the tabulation machines, publicly or privately,” Caleb Wilkins, the state GOP’s attorney, argued in a pretrial memo. 
“In the absence of such testing, there were, and are, genuine questions as to whether the tabulation machines would correctly tabulate votes cast in the election.” 
The state GOP also alleged that Lee and her election manager confirmed that all “deliverables continue to exist in a format that can be copied and provided to the plaintiffs as required by the consent decree.”
Settlement
“When the Wyoming GOP offered to settle the complaint days before the hearing, we reluctantly agreed in order to put an end to this matter and not incur additional cost to taxpayers,” Lee wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
The litigation cost Laramie County roughly $50,000 “and hundreds of hours of the Laramie County Clerk staff,” Lee wrote. 
“Under the guise of ‘integrity,’ the Wyoming GOP’s barrage of demands during a critical period in electoral operations (during the election) threatened to jeopardize the successful administration of Laramie County’s Primary and General elections,” she wrote. 
Meanwhile, the party maintains the clerk was at fault. 
“Why the Laramie County clerk initially chose not to follow Wyoming election statutes, why she ignored the requests of the Laramie County Republican Party to properly test the machines resulting in forcing the hand of the Wyoming Republican Party to file suit, and why she chose to violate the court ordered consent decree resulting from that suit we may never know for certain,” Wyoming GOP Chairman Bryan Miller said Tuesday in a statement to WyoFile.  
“But be it known to all involved in the state’s election process that the Wyoming Republican Party stands firm in protecting the integrity of Wyoming’s elections.”
The case’s dismissal last week was “with prejudice,” meaning it’s a final judgment and the case cannot be brought back to court.

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)After dropping to historic levels last year due to ongoing drought and high temperatures, hydropower generated in the Northwest is expected to rise slightly this year from much needed precipitation.
Hydropower in the region is expected to increase about 17% compared to last year, a welcome boost to growing energy demand, but will still be below the 10-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Officials at the Energy Information Administration published their 2025 forecast on May 19, as well as annual expectations for water supplies in key river basins generating the hydroelectricity.
Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average. Hydropower represents about 6% of the country’s electricity.
Amid dry, warm spring, Idaho may need to tap into water reservoirs

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring. Parts of southeast Oregon received record rainfall this spring, causing Gov. Tina Kotek in March to declare a state of emergency.
Despite the increased precipitation in some parts of the state, the Upper Columbia River Basin near Grand Coulee Dam in Washington will have a below-normal water supply this year when compared to the past 30 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest River Forecast Center. Water supply will be about normal or above normal in the southern portion of the Columbia River, which includes the Snake River Basin.
Eleven Western states produce up to 60% of the country’s hydroelectricity. Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower. About 40% of the electricity used in Oregon comes from the region’s hydroelectric dams.
But ongoing drought, periods of low precipitation and rising summer temperatures that melt mountain snowpack too quickly have led to lower-than-usual power generating capacity at dams in the West.
Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between October 2022 and September 2023. Hydropower generated in 2024 was the lowest it’s been since 2010, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
The loss in generating capacity has cost the hydropower industry billions in revenue in recent years, according to researchers from the University of Alabama. The sector lost about 300 million megawatt hours of power generation between 2003 and 2020 due to drought and low water compared with the long-term average, equating to about $28 billion in lost revenue. Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.
In Oregon, the hydroelectricity sector is estimated to have lost more than $1.5 billion in revenue over those 18 years.

Republican counterparts in Montana and Idaho are taking bold steps to protect public lands, writes guest columnist Pete Madsen.
The post Wyoming’s congressional delegation should follow neighbors’ lead on public lands appeared first on WyoFile .","When it comes to fighting to protect America’s public lands, conservative champions are emerging in the congressional delegations from our neighbors in Idaho and Montana. 
The need for conservative champions from the Cowboy State is greater than ever.

Opinion

In the first five months of 2025, the ill-considered debate over the transfer or sell-off of America’s public lands intensified, with many lawmakers in Wyoming either supporting or remaining silent on those efforts while their Republican counterparts in Montana and Idaho took bold stances for our land.
Rep. Harriet Hageman, along with Gov. Mark Gordon and 26 state legislators, supported Utah’s legal bid to transfer millions of acres of federal land to state control. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case. While the conflict still remains, defenders of public lands are increasingly stepping forward.
During our most recent Wyoming legislative session, the Senate narrowly defeated a resolution demanding the transfer of federal lands — except Yellowstone National Park — to the state. (Senators later amended the legislation to also exclude Grand Teton and Wyoming’s national forests, but that didn’t stop the measure’s defeat.)
And in Congress, the recently formed bipartisan Public Lands Caucus — launched by Republican Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing from Montana,  and Mike Simpson from Idaho — quickly demonstrated its influence by successfully advocating last week for the removal of a controversial public land sell-off amendment from the House’s reconciliation bill. 
The amendment, introduced by Republican Reps. Mark Amodei, from Nevada, and Celeste Maloy, from Utah,  and supported by Wyoming’s Rep. Harriet Hageman, authorized the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah. 
“This was my San Juan Hill; I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said after the decision.

This fight is not over, however, as the bill must now make its way through the Senate, where a simple majority could revisit the sell-off of our public lands. 
Such a move would have a hard time garnering the support of Montana’s Republican Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy. Earlier this year, they broke ranks with their party by voting for an amendment to prevent the privatization of federal public lands. This amendment sought to block the inclusion of land sales in the federal budget. It failed on a 48-51 vote, but support from Daines and Sheehy underscored Montana’s commitment to public lands. Wyoming’s senators, on the other hand, voted against the amendment. 
We need to remind Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis that protecting America’s public lands also protects Wyoming’s outdoor heritage, and it’s an idea favored by nearly 6-in-10 voters across the Cowboy State, according to a recent Colorado College poll. Simply put, protecting our public lands protects the Wyoming way of life.
Zinke, the former Interior Secretary under President Donald Trump, has also co-sponsored the “Public Lands in Public Hands Act.” This bipartisan legislation aims to prevent the Interior Department from selling or transferring public lands without congressional approval and deserves the support of our representatives. 
Zinke, Downing, Simpson and many other Western lawmakers understand what our Wyoming delegation seems to be ignoring: There is overwhelming opposition to selling off America’s public lands. 
They’d be wise to follow Zinke’s lead, and keep his view in mind: “Public land is not a Republican or Democrat issue; it’s an American issue, and we should approach it within the framework of being red, white, and blue.”

Wha[...]","Barb Emineth of Laurel speaks about NorthWestern's proposal to put a natural-gas power plant in that town. (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).Yikes. NorthWestern Energy has just outrageously imposed a 16.8% increase in electric rates for us captive customers without regulatory approval. This occurred before the June 9 hearing of the Public Service Commission where an 8.3% increase had originally been proposed. But, you may recall, NorthWestern received an increase of 28% a year-and-a-half ago. 
What is going on? Are we Montanans being unfairly exploited?
To answer this question, let us examine incentives and responsibilities. NorthWestern Energy, a descendent of Montana Power, is a monopoly. With respect to the distribution of electricity and gas, it seems appropriate for only one energy corporation to be a provider. Otherwise, we might be beset by the chaotic mess of poles, wires, and pipes of competing companies. But with no competition, a monopoly can charge exorbitant fees, public welfare be damned.
To protect the more than 400,000 customers of NorthWestern Energy from predatory charges, the publicly-elected members of the PSC are legally granted the authority to approve or disapprove utility rates and what are essentially profit margins (“return on equity” is the technical name, but corporate profits are what’s truly at play). Hence NorthWestern, a large investor-owned corporation, has the incentive to increase profits while the PSC, a governmental agency, has the responsibility of protecting public welfare.
Let’s first examine who profits economically from the income NorthWestern is able to generate. The primary beneficiaries are corporate shareholders, most of whom do not live in Montana. The PSC has traditionally granted the utility profits of about 10% annually. What, 10%?  Some large corporations, such as successful supermarket chains, are happy to receive a 1 to 3% yearly profit. Outsiders, rather than Montana citizens and our small businesses, are the beneficiaries of the current arrangement. (Large corporations and institutions are able to negotiate lower rates from NorthWestern.)
Further beneficiaries of profits are the corporate executives, most of whom reside in Sioux Falls, the corporate headquarters. It must be great to be Brian Bird, the CEO of NorthWestern. He earns about $2400 per hour. NorthWestern might claim that his compensation is in line with other energy CEOs, but that seems more like an indictment of unjust wealth distribution than a valid argument for such compensation
NorthWestern, with its army of lawyers, engineers, and public relations persons, seems like Goliath in relation to the PSC as David. To the PSC’s credit, last year it applied a 7.24% decrease in the interim residential rates NorthWestern charged. But when the rates Montanans now pay are compared with the rates customers in other Western states pay, it is clear the PSC needs to do more to protect Montanans from outsourcing our wealth. For 800 kilowatts of power each month, Idaho Power charges customers $70. NorthWestern has charged $107, but with its imposed increase it will be $125.  
NorthWestern’s incentive to increase profits for shareholders encourages it to engage in expensive projects of expansion with little regard for prudent spending or even proper approval. A new rate increase would pass on to us consumers the costs of building and operating the Laurel methane-fired plant, brazenly constructed even when violating zoning laws and without approval of the PSC. 
Its guaranteed profit means that NorthWestern ratepayers must cover all of the utility’s expenses, even those spent on unwise and unapproved projects. We, not they, shoulder the risks. The PSC can restore balance by holding NorthWestern to reasonable standards with fair rates for everyday Montanans. 
The PSC will hold a public hearing in Helena on June 9 to discuss how to respond to Northwestern’s requested rate increases. PSC members need to deny these unjust rate hikes and thereby reduce NorthWestern’s exorbitant 10.8% return on equity (profit). Granting an increase in rates legitimates NorthWestern’s arrogant and risky actions that benefit shareholders but further stress local families and small businesses. Ratepayers and the PSC must stand up to this out-of-control monopoly.

As a result of O’Connell’s public stance, Homan warned that Nashville could soon see an […]","Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell with, at far left, Metro Nashville Legal Director Wally Dietz and near left, Hal Cato, CEO of the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee at a May 5 press conference addressing raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)U.S. “border czar” Tom Homan said Tuesday on Fox News that Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell is under investigation by a Congressional committee over his condemnation of immigration sweeps that led to the detention of nearly 200 people earlier this month.
As a result of O’Connell’s public stance, Homan warned that Nashville could soon see an even larger federal multi-agency immigration crackdowns: “We’ll flood the zone,” Homan said repeatedly.
“We’ll flood the zone in the neighborhoods to find the bad guy. We’ll flood the zone at work sites to find the bad guy, but we’re going to do it, and he’s (O’Connell) not going to stop us,” said Homan, the White House executive director of enforcement and removal operations.
A spokesperson for the Congressional House Homeland Security Committee referenced by Homan did not respond to questions about a potential investigation. The committee is chaired by Tennessee Republican Rep. Mark Green.
Homan’s remarks came days after Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles held a press conference to denounce O’Connell, a Democrat, for “aiding and abetting illegal immigration.” Ogles, without offering evidence, accused the Nashville mayor of obstructing the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. An Ogles spokesman did not respond to questions about his assertions this week.
Ogles instead used his Memorial Day press conference to reference O’Connell’s public remarks condemning a joint effort by the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE agents during the first two weeks of May, when state troopers making traffic stops led to the ICE detention of 196 individuals in one of Nashville’s most heavily immigrant neighborhoods. The majority of those detained had no criminal records.
Tensions run high among officials, community organizations after ICE enforcement in Nashville

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell publicly said of the early May detentions.
Ogles also cited an executive order signed by O’Connell that requires city emergency officials to report, within 24 hours, any interaction with federal immigration enforcement officials to the Mayor’s Office of New Americans.
Homan appeared on The Ingraham Angle Fox News program with host Laura Ingraham Tuesday.  “We’ll see,” he said in response to a question from Ingraham about whether he would seek criminal prosecution of O’Connell.
“I know Homeland Oversight is opening up a congressional investigation,” Homan said.
“I cannot confirm or deny if ICE is investigating (O’Connell), but we’ll see where it plays out. It isn’t just what he says, it’s what he does…I said that from day one that we’re going to hit every sanctuary city. Everybody that wants to push back against ICE, we’re going to pay a lot of attention to them.”
Nashville is not a so-called sanctuary city, a designation adopted by some U.S. cities to limit cooperation with ICE relating to immigrants accused of non-violent crimes. State law bars all Tennessee cities from adopting sanctuary status.
In his television appearance, Homan also took aim at O’Connell’s support for the so-called “Belonging Fund” established by the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee, a 30-year-old mainstay of the local charitable sector.
The Community Foundation announced in early May the creation of an emergency assistance fund for transportation, rent, food, and child care for immigrant families impacted by ICE sweeps.
The fund, as of Wednesday, has raised $286,343 in private donations and does not receive public funding, according to a foundation spokesperson.

“As far as the belonging fund that (O’Connell is) supporting, I have my own belonging fund,” Homan said Tuesday. “We can give housing, food and free medical care in ICE detention and that’s exactly what we’re going to do in Nashville.”
Ogles took to the social media platform X Wednesday in a series of posts to amplify his criticism of the Belonging Fund, inaccurately labeling it as the “mayor’s fund.”
“Mayor O’Connell’s so-called “Belonging Fund” — which may be using taxpayer dollars to help illegal aliens evade ICE — has no system to track who the money is going to?,” he wrote. “This is exactly how Americans end up funding terrorists and gangs. Shut down the fund. Investigate O’Connell.”
Community Foundation officials, in announcing the fund, pledged they would keep confidential the names of individual recipients of aid.
Recipients of The Belonging Fund donations thus far have included a pregnant woman unable to work due to health conditions, who used the funding to buy medication, food and pay part of her rent after Nashville immigration sweeps caught up the family’s breadwinner, the foundation spokesperson said.
Another recipient spent the $1,600 she received from the fund on food and rent after family members were taken into custody, the spokesperson said.
Immigrant advocates have highlighted the terror and trauma experienced by immigrants caught up in sweeps that took place near busy thoroughfares in South Nashville, an immigrant community hub. Children at the scene were seen tears as mass arrests were made.

“It appears anti-immigrant politicians and pundits are still clamoring to spin this traumatizing event — which left children at home without caregivers, pregnant mothers without income to support their families, and community members too fearful to leave their homes for groceries,” said an emailed statement from Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Commission, which has helped connect funding to families impacted by the immigration sweeps.
Sherman Luna called the measure an effort to “further their political agenda, drive division in our city, and demonize immigrant communities and those who support us.”
In a separate post, Ogles on Wednesday claimed he had met with ICE officials who told him, “there’s an illegal alien gang operating in every Tennessee city. No one is safe. This isn’t rhetoric — it’s the reality of blue mayors obstructing law enforcement.”
Ogles did not provide support for those claims on social media. The majority of cities in Tennessee, which is largely rural and Republican, appear to be led by mayors who are either nonpartisan or Republican.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)MAGNOLIA, Ark. — After a third attempt, a lithium royalty has been set for the first time in Arkansas.
The Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve an application by SWA Lithium, a joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy company Equinor, to set a 2.5% royalty on lithium extracted from brine.
The royalty applies only to the Reynolds Unit, which encompasses parts of Columbia and Lafayette Counties.
You can read a breakdown of the now-approved application here.
The royalty structure proposed by the joint venture was identical to the structure proposed in a rejected 2024 royalty application. At least 100 people and companies objected to last year’s application — but only a half dozen submitted written objections this time around.
﻿
This time, Standard Lithium was able to overcome concerns about whether its proposed royalty was fair and equitable, as required under state law.
Commissioner Charles Wohlford, who extensively questioned applicants during the November hearing, made the motion to approve the latest application, noting when making the motion that he believed the proposal was fair, consistent and competitive. 
Unlike during the previous royalty hearing, the joint venture presented more concrete projections about what it would cost to build the first phase of its SWA Project, also known as Smackover Lithium. 
Jesse Edmondson, Standard Lithium’s director of government affairs, said at the start of the hearing that a failure to set the royalty this time would be detrimental to the venture’s ability to proceed.
Wednesday’s hearing moved swiftly compared to the November hearing, which lasted two days and saw dozens of objections and public comments. 
Only six formal written objections were submitted to the commission prior to Wednesday’s hearing, and only two individuals spoke against the 2.5% proposed royalty. Barely anyone spoke in favor of the 1.82% royalty rate that had been offered in November, but far more spoke in favor of the 2.5% rate — mostly elected officials and economic and educational leaders in South Arkansas, whose institutions stand to gain from commercial lithium extraction, which an approved royalty brings closer to reality. All those who spoke in favor highlighted the positive economic impacts the project is expected to have on the area.
Latest lithium royalties hearing set for Wednesday in Magnolia

Joshua Gaines, a mineral rights owner living in Columbia County who said he was speaking on behalf of “the little guy,” was one of the two who spoke in opposition to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty. In his comments to the commission, he lambasted “corporate greed” and said that since the joint venture would be profiting on his minerals, he and other mineral rights owners deserved a fair share.
He took issue with the commission setting a hearing at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday — a time, Gaines said, that most local people would not be able to attend. Gaines said he had to take the day off work to attend, but added that many people wouldn’t have that option.
Meanwhile, Emon Mahony, the vice president of the South Arkansas Minerals Association, which represents mineral-rights holders, urged the commission to ignore outside pressure to approve the application. He accused prospective lithium companies of purposefully low-balling proposed royalties to pressure the commission to accept a royalty that wasn’t fair and equitable.
“I know that the longer this drags on, the more pressure you’re going to feel to take the easy number that they’re putting in front of you on that day,” Mahony said. “Pressure will eventually get to you, and mineral owners won’t get a fair deal.”
Commissioner Jim Phillips took issue with that. After Mahony finished, Phillips invoked the words of former AOGC commissioner Mike Davis, saying he and his fellow commissioners leave their friendships at the door when making decisions. Royalty owners were not the only people the commission had to consider in its decision, Phillips said.


Let us know what you think...


 

“We also have to consider the people that can’t afford to be here; the mom-and-pops, the restaurants, the severance tax that goes to the cops, the police, the firemen, the schools,” Phillips said. “I mean, there’s a whole bigger picture.”
“We get pressure from the state; we get pressure from elected officials,” Phillips continued. “I’m getting a lot of pressure, but it’s from myself, to get this right and to get it done” so it’s fair to everyone.
Andy Robinson, president and chief operating officer of Standard Lithium, said he was “really pleased” by the commission’s vote. The goal is to make a final decision on whether to move forward with the project by the end of the year, Robinson confirmed.
Having more clarity as to the costs of the full-fledged project allows the companies to begin seeking the financing needed to pay for the rest of the project, Robinson said after the hearing. The company estimates the cost at upwards of $1 billion. The venture has already obtained $225 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy.
Robert Reynolds, president of the mineral owners group, said the result wasn’t what they hoped for. Whether SAMA objects to future royalty applications filed by other companies, Reynolds said, would depend on the terms proposed in those applications.
In an emailed statement sent out immediately after the conclusion of the hearing, Department of Energy and Environment Secretary Shane Khoury said the approval was “a huge step forward” for the state’s nascent lithium industry.
“Lithuim brine extraction in Arkansas is unique — it enables Arkansas to unleash its energy and critical mineral potential in a way that results in minimal surface impact to the Natural State,” Khoury said. 
In the same emailed statement, commission chairman Jerry Langley declared mission accomplished, after saying last year that the commission had one shot to get the royalty matter right.
“Throughout this process, all parties wanted a payment structure that is fair, consistent, and competitive, and today’s approval accomplishes this goal,” Langley said.

In this way, the cost of being charged “reasonable” attorney fees is to take your case to trial and risk losing your home, writes guest columnist Declan North.Being taken to eviction court comes at a grave cost to Idaho tenants. Recent data shows that the threat of eviction leads to a significant increase in depression, anxiety, psychological distress, suicide, poor self-reported health, high blood pressure, and premature death.
Jesse Tree, an eviction prevention nonprofit in the Treasure Valley, estimates that 95% of all evictions occur due to a family’s temporary inability to pay rent as a result of an unexpected expense like a medical emergency or car accident. 
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

In addition to the physical and mental costs, the financial cost of eviction on tenants is equally harmful and far less covered by media and research articles. 
Falling behind on rent is only the beginning of a tenant’s financial hardship in Idaho. This is due to landlords shifting the cost of legal fees, including hiring an eviction attorney, onto tenants. As a result, tenants can enter the courtroom in debt to their landlord for rent and, after legal fees, leave with their debt doubled or tripled by a $1,500 attorney fee. This practice worsens housing insecurity for already vulnerable renters. 
Landlords can shift these fees if the lease and eviction notice state that legal fees will be awarded to the “prevailing party.” 
While Idaho has protections against “unreasonable” attorney fees, few tenants actually benefit from the spirit or letter of this law. The law specifies that the reasonableness of attorney fees must be determined by a judge after a case has gone to trial, but tenants are encouraged by advocates, nonprofits, and even judges to avoid going to trial. 
Idaho’s limited tenant protections, combined with the consequences of an eviction judgment on a tenant’s record, and the lack of available attorneys for tenants often make going to trial too great a risk. In this way, the cost of being charged “reasonable” attorney fees is to take your case to trial and risk losing your home. 
In addition, there is no agreement on whether there is a “prevailing party” if cases do not go to trial. Most private landlords say that there is, but agencies like the Boise City Ada County Housing Authority do not. 
Rather than go to trial, tenants can choose mediation to find an agreement out of court. In Ada County, legal fees billed after mediation can range from $600-$1,750. Despite this high price, the legal paperwork needed for a mediated agreement is minimal, only requiring the attorney to complete a few basic forms. 
On top of this, landlord attorneys have started to increase their fees, knowing that they will be passed on to the tenant. While more understanding landlords offer payment plans to cover legal fees, tenants still have no choice but to pay the fees and often seek help from nonprofits like Jesse Tree. 
When tenants are expected to pay portions of these fees on top of rent as they work to recover from the emergency that caused them to be at risk of eviction, they remain insecure in their housing longer-term. With these legal fee increases, even nonprofit assistance is not enough to prevent tenants from leaving court with more debt. 
Idaho’s eviction court process is uniquely problematic. A recent report shows that rents in this state are projected to rise faster than all but one other city in the United States. As rents increase, more and more renters will fall behind and find themselves facing eviction. Without serious reform, the court system will have unnecessarily pushed people into further housing insecurity and homelessness.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Seeking a deputy secretary post in the Trump administration, former Tennessee Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn is promising to eliminate financial conflicts of interest to get the job, including minimizing ties to a Tennessee lobbying firm.
Schwinn, who left the state job in 2023 and served for a short time as Vice President for PK-12 and Pre-Bachelors Programs at the University of Florida, was selected for the U.S. Department of Education position nearly as soon as President Donald Trump won election this year but still hasn’t received Senate confirmation to take the appointment.
In a May 5 letter to an Education Department ethics official, the former Tennessee education leader for Gov. Bill Lee described steps she would take to avoid any “actual or apparent” conflict of interest, including personal participation in any matter in which she would have a financial interest.
If confirmed for the job, Schwinn said she will resign from an unpaid position with Nashville-based 38 Ventures LLC and become a non-managing member, though she will receive passive investment income from the entity. Blake Harris, former chief of staff for Lee, is the registered agent for the company located at 611 Commerce St.
In addition, Schwinn said she would resign her post with BHA Strategy, a lobbying company founded by Harris, Lee’s former communication director Laine Arnold, and Brent Easley, the governor’s former legislative director. Schwinn wrote, though, that she would receive a set referral fee of 30% for a contract she brought to BHA.
Education commissioner runs into possible conflict with $8M contract

Schwinn said two companies she controls, Bexley Group, LLC, and PLSchwinn LLC, which are set up to receive business income, would stop conducting business and representing clients. Bexley Group’s listed address also is 611 Commerce St. in Nashville.
After being confirmed, she also would resign from a post with Soliant Health LLC through which she holds vested and unvested incentives with TVG-Soliant Holdings, LP. She would receive a cash payout for her vested incentives before taking the deputy secretary post, according to the letter.
In addition, Schwinn said she would resign from posts with TVG-MGT, Edmuntum Inc. and Really Great Reading and would divest interests in Odyssey and Amira Learning.
Schwinn went through a similar ethics process in March 2021 when she told Tennessee’s Central Procurement Office she would distance herself from an $8 million contract with TNTP Inc., a reading skills educator training company that employed her husband, Paul.
Schwinn came under fire from lawmakers in 2020 when the legislature removed the education commissioner as a voting member of the Tennessee textbook commission and took away the commissioner’s ability to grant waivers for school districts seeking to use unapproved books and materials. Lawmakers were concerned that Schwinn was too involved in the textbook adoption process.

DemasThis story was published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence.
The first fatal shooting of the year in Lansing, Michigan, was solved quickly. All four alleged shooters in the drive-by killing of 21-year-old Jaivion Husband on January 27 were arrested the same night. 
The circumstances around the men involved in the shooting were complicated; three of the four were fellows with Advance Peace, a violence intervention program that was launched in Lansing in 2022, after initial hesitation from law enforcement. The fellowship is designed to keep people who have been engaged in shootings away from situations like these through concentrated mentoring, daily communication, job opportunities, skills development, and monthly stipends.
After the suspects had been arrested, Paul Elam, a criminologist at the Michigan Public Health Institute who helped bring Advance Peace to town, visited the fellows. One of them, a 19-year-old who had been with the program since the beginning, broke down in tears, telling Elam that he knew getting into the car that night was a mistake. “He told me, ‘I let you down, I should have called,’” Elam recalled. “They let somebody influence them to hop in the car and go do something. He was able to articulate that he was changing his behavior, but he had this moment where he didn’t do what he knew was right.” 
The tragedy reminded the leaders that a moment is all it takes. The fellows “have so much coming at them daily,” Elam said. “You don’t know what they’re being pressured to do.”
In the two-plus years since Advance Peace came to Lansing, gun violence in the city has dropped by 52 percent, according to police data, and community activists, along with law enforcement, are pointing to the program’s success. The program isn’t perfect, some city leaders acknowledge, but it is making long-term strides to accomplish mutual violence prevention goals.
Residents in Lansing said the actions taken by the police, including a focus on repeat offenders and illegal firearms, have also played an important role. To sustain the city’s progress, police officers and community workers are navigating the streets carefully — cooperatively, but independently. 
Since its inception in 2010, Advance Peace has been effective in other cities including Richmond, CA and Rochester, NY. Unlike other national anti-violence organizations, this one doesn’t focus on geographical areas, victims of shootings, or people who could potentially get involved with gun violence. Instead, their violence interrupters identify people through information from family members or others plugged in on the streets who are shooters — people often unknown to the police. Once they identify the shooters, they enroll them in an 18-month fellowship program, during which they work directly with community violence interrupters, or credible messengers, who check in on them multiple times a day. In Lansing, one interventionist works with as many as five fellows at once. 
“If a shooting occurred this week, nobody’s going to talk to the police, but they’re going to talk to our people,” said Elam. “The target population for us is folks who are engaged in gun violence, who are evading law enforcement and the justice system.” 
Throughout the mid-to-late 2010s, shootings in Lansing weren’t concentrated in specific areas; gun violence was more sporadic and random, especially across the south side of the city, where 60 percent of the population lives. No particular demographic or age group was overrepresented among perpetrators or victims, a reflection of the city’s relative progress in addressing the historic segregation that still dogs nearby cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo. 
That all changed after COVID-19 hit and retaliatory conflicts worsened between different groups on the southwest and west sides — neighborhood beefs, escalated on social media during lockdowns, turned into shootings. Shootings in Lansing increased by 80 percent between 2019 and 2020. In 2021, the city notched the highest number of homicides ever, with 25. 
“It was lawless. A lot of young men were engaging in this back-and-forth, cyclical gunfire, and you had kids dying,” said Michael Lynn, a local activist who runs The Lansing Empowerment Network and The Village Lansing, two organizations focused on addressing and providing wrap-around services to those most affected by gun violence. “When the pandemic happened, it was like a bomb went off in the city.” 
Shootings in Lansing have been in decline since the peaks of 2021, similar to national trends and the result of strategic work by community groups and law enforcement after the surge in youth violence. Though the program now receives widespread praise, when Advance Peace was first introduced in 2021 as a potential option for tackling the worsening crisis, Police Chief Robert Backus said the model didn’t “sit well” with his colleagues. “There was skepticism about how it focused on people you knew were your priority offenders,” Backus said. 
Marlon Beard, a credible messenger with Advance Peace, said at first “everybody was looking at it like, ‘so you guys gonna pay shooters and sponsor them to buy them guns.’ I think that was just ignorance of not really sitting down to do your research.” 
Once law enforcement and city leadership were educated about the mechanics of the program, they became more receptive to it, Beard said. 
During a recent event on the Michigan State campus, a handful of fellows, along with the credible messengers, learned about financial responsibility and entrepreneurship through an exercise led by Archie Hudson, a local business owner in Lansing. On the streets, these kids are often treated as — or posture as — adults, but in this setting, as they asked inquisitive questions and answered with “yes, sir” and “no, sir,” their age was apparent. Some were just 13 or 14. More importantly, they were comfortable around the credible messengers and other leaders of Advance Peace, the result of a hard-won trust.
“We never involve the police. Every conflict we’ve had resolved doesn’t involve the police,” said DeAndre McFadden, one of the credible messengers, as they’re called, who is working for the program. “They know they can’t infiltrate the situation the way we can. So far, the police have respected our space and our work.”
Though Advance Peace doesn’t share any information with the police, a key reason the organization retains its credibility, the authorities provide Advance Peace with regular shooting data and a list of names of people they believe to be involved in gun violence. 
“It’s almost like we’re running parallel to each other, like we both have the same goal, which is no more violent incidents,” Chief Backus said, noting that the priority of police is enforcement and accountability. “We have an obligation to represent victims, and if someone is our suspect, we have an obligation to put that person in front of a judge.” 
Despite the success of recent efforts, distrust between residents and the Police Department persists. That distrust stems from a decade of police shootings in and around Lansing, and a lack of transparency from the department on how the investigations progress, community leaders said. Since 2020, there have been four officer-involved shootings in Lansing, which has a population of roughly 112,000, and all of the cases were deemed “justifiable.” By comparison, in the 10 years before 2020, there were four. In the most recent case, in December 2023, officers shot and killed Stephen Romero, a Hispanic man, after they were called for a domestic dispute. 
“How can we create real positive relations when all of this is consistently going on,” asked Lynn, the local activist.
Backus acknowledged that police shootings erode progress, and since they’ve happened more frequently since 2020, it’s been difficult to rebuild trust. “When they’re happening so often in a short time, it doesn’t give us time to repair those relationships,” he said, adding that unsolved homicides and people’s unwillingness to speak to the police also hurt officers’ credibility in the community.
“Ain’t nothing changed,” said Beard, the Advance Peace worker, referring to the tense relationship between the community and law enforcement. “The same way we get looked at as Black men — because one Black man did something, we all did it — that’s kind of how we view the police.” 
One of the fellows with the program said if the police ever tried to talk to him, he’d “just walk away and not say anything.”
Over the last few years, the department has tried to put more emphasis on developing trust in the community by hosting more events, getting in front of active local groups, and being more visible in struggling areas. It has also focused more on firearms access. But the road to strategic cooperation is long.
That’s why activists, residents, and police agree that Advance Peace is crucial. A recent study of the program revealed some promising data, showing that over 90 percent of the fellows no longer use guns to resolve their conflicts. Yet just as the program is beginning to show its worth, the city is in jeopardy of losing it, as it’s funded in large part by community violence interruption grants from the federal government that were terminated in April by the Department of Justice, leaving cities like Lansing scrambling for alternative funding sources. Some groups have joined a lawsuit against the Trump administration to restore the funding. 
DeVone Boggan, who is originally from Lansing and founded Advance Peace in Oakland, California, in 2010, said the recent funding issues are another example of why local cities and counties need to include funding for community violence intervention work in their fiscal budgets. “That local infrastructure must budget for CVI practices,” Boggan said. “That’s the only way to sustain the work.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_7926-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-05-29 06:04:17.954321

(Photo: John Partipilo)Congress may be poised to roll back electric vehicle tax credits and institute new annual taxes on electric vehicle owners — moves that could spell trouble for electric vehicle manufacturers in Tennessee and across the country, according to industry organizations.
The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a revised version of President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill last week. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” slashes multiple tax credits available to consumers who purchase new, used and commercial electric vehicles (EVs). It also creates a new annual tax for owners of EVs ($250) and hybrid vehicles ($100), money meant to make up for a lack of owners’ lack of gas tax contributions toward infrastructure upkeep.
The bill now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration. Should it pass, the EV tax credits will expire on December 31, 2025, instead of the original December 2032 sunset date.
Industry advocates and analysts warn that axing the tax credits — which can save buyers up to $7,500 on new, American-made and sourced EVs — will kill the industry’s momentum in Tennessee and put investments and jobs at risk.
Tennessee has incentivized its growing electric vehicle industry with hundreds of millions of dollars of state contributions and tax breaks over the last decade. The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development estimates more than 20,000 Tennesseans are employed by companies with EV operations, and EV projects have injected $16.2 billion in capital into the state since 2017. In West Tennessee, BlueOval City’s EV assembly line for Ford’s new electric truck is still under construction, and BlueOval SK is gearing up for battery production. The massive $5.6 billion campus is expected to reshape and reinvigorate rural West Tennessee.
The Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group advocating for electric vehicle adoption and supportive public policy, called the move a “sledgehammer to Tennessee’s EV industry” in a statement published Tuesday.
EVs in Tennessee: Uncertainty abounds as Trump targets Biden-era electric vehicle funding

“It would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Electrification Coalition Executive Director Ben Prochazka stated. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting Tennessee jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”
Reached by email, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development declined to comment on industry organizations’ concerns.
What does this mean for Tennessee auto manufacturing?
Tennessee’s electric vehicle industry has grown over the last two decades to include manufacturing plants for Ford, Volkswagen and GM, in addition to multiple companies that produce EV batteries or EV battery components.
Nissan also assembled its all-electric Nissan LEAF at its plant in Smyrna until recently. The 2026 LEAF will be assembled at the company’s Tochigi Plant in Japan, according to a company spokesperson, meaning the company no longer assembles any EVs or hybrid vehicles in Tennessee.
The state has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the electric vehicle industry over the last decade, according to records kept by the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development. This includes a $78 million grant for the recruitment of Ultium Cells LLC, an EV battery manufacturer, to locate jobs for 1,300 workers in Maury County.
State lawmakers approved a $900 million incentive package for Ford’s BlueOval City campus in 2021, including $500 million in reimbursements for construction work on the campus in Stanton, Tennessee.
Some U.S. Republicans are pushing to keep energy tax credits. Tennessee lawmakers aren’t among them.

While Tennessee’s growth in the industry predates tax incentives created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden to support the production of batteries and battery components in the U.S., those incentives helped companies stand up more cost-competitive electric vehicle plants in the U.S., Harrison Godfrey, managing director of clean energy industry association Advanced Energy United, told Tennessee Lookout in November.
An October Washington Post analysis found Tennessee received an estimated $12.6 billion in investments in clean energy projects since the IRA passed in 2022.
Ford and GM did not respond to requests for comment on the potential rollback of consumer EV tax credits. But the Alliance for Automotive Innovation — an industry group with members from 42 U.S. automotive companies including GM, Ford, Nissan and Volkswagen — listed support for electric vehicle manufacturing among its 2025 policy priorities. 
The organization specifically stated that policymakers should maintain both production tax credits for vehicle manufacturers and “consumer incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles.”
The Nissan spokesperson stated the company’s position on EV tax credits aligns with the policy priorities of Autos Drive America, a trade association representing international automakers in the U.S., including Nissan. Autos Drive America has worked to increase the number of electric vehicles that qualify for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit since the IRA’s passage in 2022.
The Tennessee Chamber of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment.
Budget politics
In April, Gov. Bill Lee celebrated the latest EV-related business expansion in Tennessee: a $54 million investment from automotive supplier Avancez in assembly operations at the BlueOval City Supplier Park.
A spokesperson for Lee did not respond to a request for comment on how EV tax credit rollbacks may impact Tennessee’s continued industry growth. 
Lee voiced his support for the budget bill in a post on X on May 21, saying it will “secure the border, unleash American energy & deliver tax cuts — all measures that guarantee opportunity, security & freedom for the American people.”
The Electrification Coalition urged U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty to “take a more balanced approach” and preserve the tax credits to ensure the U.S. does not fall “further behind” in the global EV market.
Blackburn and Hagerty did not respond to requests for comment.
All of Tennessee’s U.S. Representatives voted in favor of the budget reconciliation bill, except for U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat based in Memphis. The bill passed in the House 215-214. All Democratic representatives voted against the bill.
Cohen could not be reached for comment by press time. U.S. Republican Reps. DesJarlais, Fleischmann, Green, Harshbarger, Kustoff, Ogles and Rose did not respond to requests for comment.
  “This bill rolls back Biden’s Green New Deal tax credits that we don’t have the money to pay for,” said Tennessee 2nd District U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of President Donald Trump’s budget reconciliation bill, which cuts tax credits to electric vehicle owners and levies new fees. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Republican representing East Tennessee, said in an emailed statement to Tennessee Lookout that he voted in favor of the bill due to national debt concerns.
“Our nation is currently $36 trillion in debt,” Burchett stated. “This bill rolls back Biden’s Green New Deal tax credits that we don’t have the money to pay for. I believe in an all-of-the-above energy approach, but we shouldn’t plunge our country deeper in debt as a result.”
Burchett also stated that the new tax for EV and hybrid owners “makes sure all drivers contribute towards our nation’s infrastructure,” as “electric vehicle owners don’t pay a gas tax which is used to fund vital highway projects.”
The Electrification Coalition and Nissan both expressed support for EV and hybrid drivers paying their “fair share” toward infrastructure, but the new tax level is more punitive than practical. 
“We believe the new annual tax should be more in line with the gas tax equivalent ($150) rather than being set at a level that seems punitive,” the Nissan spokesperson stated.
“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka, of the Electrification Coalition, stated. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The state’s legislative leaders don’t yet have the efficiency study they asked for from the cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA), but for the past two weeks, they’ve had a 19-page report.
That puts the state’s public transit agency a third of the way done with an overdue study lawmakers mandated RIPTA deliver to them by March 1.
The efficiency study was requested by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget to plug the agency’s deficit. RIPTA now faces a $32.6 million shortfall heading into the fiscal year beginning July 1.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who has made clear there is no extra money to fill RIPTA’s deficit now that federal pandemic aid has dried up, confirmed Wednesday that he had received the report.
“I received an embargoed synopsis that I have not fully reviewed yet,” Shekarchi said in a statement. “However, I look forward to hearing from RIPTA on how they plan to change their management practices.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson said she too plans to review the memo sent by RIPTA.
“This is an issue that has been a top concern of many members of the Senate,“ she said in a statement. “A robust public transit system is vital to our economy and quality of life.”
RIPTA’s board of directors commissioned Canadian-headquartered engineering consulting firm WSP to do the efficiency study on March 27 at a cost of $412,346. The scope outlined in RIPTA’s request for proposals called on the contractor to deliver a memo within 30 business days detailing best practices among public transit agencies, a performance assessment of transit operations within 45 days, and a review of the state’s long-term transit strategy and its implementation within 75 days.
“We’re working rapidly to get all reports coming out of the study to the General Assembly as soon as possible to inform the state budget,” agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in an email to Rhode Island Current. “We will update you when the next product is complete.”  
WSP completed the first phase on May 16, a report that looked at five other similar-sized transit agencies. The peer comparison report confirmed that RIPTA is not alone in facing a post-pandemic deficit.
The other agencies were Hampton Roads Transit based out of Norfolk, Virginia; Regional Transit Service, which services Rochester, New York; Capital District Transit Authority, which serves Albany; Delaware Transit Corp.; and the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority.
The report found per capita spending ranged from $23 to $145 among the five while administrative cost per service hour ranged from $21 to $48. Other data points included advertising revenue and passenger trips per service hour and fare revenue per trip.
But no corresponding figures for RIPTA are provided in WSP’s memo. 
“Recognizing the timing constraints related to the state budget process concluding in June, we have structured the scope of work to prioritize delivering critical information as quickly as possible,” Raposo Perry said. “This includes sharing draft deliverables such as this. The final report will include those figures.”
A man who answered the phone at a Connecticut number for WSP said he could not answer questions about the report and then hung up. A spokesperson for the firm in Montreal did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
“Many agencies are facing a drop in funding due to expiring pandemic funding and rising costs due to inflation,” the WSP report states.
WSP pointed to a “novel approach” of one agency’s pursuit of “universal access agreements,” defined as partnerships where employers pay an annual fee to cover their workers’ fares to commute. But the report does not specify which of the five agencies had embraced these initiatives.
RIPTA has already been coordinating with area employers to boost revenue. In January, RIPTA extended its 10x and 28 routes to align with shift schedules at the new Amazon Fulfillment Center off Route 6 in Johnston. In return, Amazon agreed to pay $90,000 annually over the next decade to cover employee fares.
On Wednesday, RIPTA announced that the Omni Providence Hotel First Hotel Group had agreed to partially subsidize fares for 216 employees who work at Rhode Island’s largest hotel. Passes for the general public cost $70 but the pass costs $65 for participants in the “Wave to Work” program. Raposo Perry said the hotel will pay $45 per monthly pass, while hotel employees pay the remaining $20 balance for unlimited bus rides.
Legislators have proposed their own measures to close RIPTA’s deficit. That includes legislation that would put a $100 million transit bond on the 2026 ballot, upping the agency’s share of the gas tax, and added rideshare fees that would go directly toward funding mass transit.
Transit advocates have also pointed to resolutions introduced in the House and Senate in late February that would appropriate the full $32.6 million to keep the agency afloat for another year.
But the Rhode Island General Assembly is facing significant challenges with a budget deficit and potentially devastating federal funding cuts with just weeks to go before the end of the 2025 legislative session. 
Among them, a $17.8 million budget shortfall for the state’s homelessness services and an additional $15 million to cover proposed pay raises for state troopers and correctional officers.. The state will also have to make up a $24 million shortfall in education aid to local school districts in its fiscal 2025 and 26 budgets after a correction was made to data on the number of students in poverty.

(Getty Images)Republicans in Congress aren’t satisfied with just slashing Medicaid, so they are now looking at using reconciliation to repeal large swaths of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to pay for tax breaks for billionaires, big corporations and campaign donors.
These days, everyone has heard of “Obamacare,” the landmark 2010 law that for the first-time created consumer protections like no discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and gender, and no annual or lifetime caps on coverage.
The Affordable Care Act turned 15 earlier this year and, despite a rocky start and endless “Repeal and Replace” attacks from Republican opponents in Congress and President Donald Trump, it has persisted and is more popular than ever. While the march towards quality, affordable health care for all remains a long one, the political battle to pass the ACA by the narrowest of margins was huge, and we now face another huge fight to maintain the gains we’ve made in healthcare access and equity so that progress isn’t lost. 
Under the current administration and Republican-controlled Congress, the ACA, including Medicaid coverage, are at risk once again. Congress is marking up its long-awaited committee bills to achieve the $1.5 trillion in spending cuts outlined in April’s budget resolution to hand out tax breaks to billionaires, big corporations, and campaign donors.
The budget resolution outlines significant cuts to Medicaid, squarely threatening Medicaid expansion which covers more than 160,000 West Virginians. Among the included provisions are harsh work reporting requirements for adults between the ages of 19 and 64, increased paperwork and red tape for all expansion enrollees, and increased cost sharing and co-pays for some adults.
A recent report by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy estimates that roughly 40,000 West Virginians would lose their health care coverage as a result, including more than 23,000 residents in Congresswoman Carol Miller’s district and 17,000 in Congressman Riley Moore’s.
In addition, these coverage losses would result in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding that currently goes to hospitals and providers in West Virginia. As a result, thousands of jobs in the state would be lost and rural providers have warned that hospitals operating on the margins would be at risk of closure.
Also, this resolution does not extend the enhanced premium tax credits that have helped more people get affordable coverage since 2022. More than 50,000 West Virginians get their health coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace, with over 95% receiving a tax credit subsidy to help make their monthly premiums more affordable. As part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and then the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Congress increased the amount of financial assistance available to families who get their health coverage through the ACA marketplace. In West Virginia, this resulted in marketplace enrollment more than doubling. 
West Virginia residents saw the most benefit from the increased ACA subsidies, as our state has the highest health care costs in the country. If allowed to expire at the end of the year, the 50,000 residents who get their health coverage through the Marketplace would see their monthly premiums increase by 140 percent.
We’ve been down this road before. Taken together, the renewed Republican effort to repeal key parts of the ACA will threaten coverage for upwards of 25 million Americans, and that doesn’t include coverage losses resulting from their attacks on Medicaid.
These policies are highly unpopular — even among Republican voters. If Republicans get their way, costs will go up, hardworking families will lose their coverage, and the entire health care system will be thrown into chaos.  
This means that Republicans, after promising to lower prices and improve the economy for working Americans, are set to do the very opposite: take food and health care away from working class families to make the richest people even richer.  It’s up to us to stop them.

Federal reimbursement for damage after flooding is frustratingly slow and complex, but state officials still see it as essential support.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘We need help’: While tallying recent assistance, Vermont officials consider a future without FEMA.","For many Vermonters, summer’s return ushers in familiar fears of flooding. This year, that anxiety is complicated by a new concern surrounding federal changes to disaster relief programs that have helped the state in the recent past.State and local leaders worry about how reductions in staff and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or the loss of the system altogether, may be felt in Vermont, in the near and long term. Already, an estimated 20% of permanent staff have left the agency through buyouts or early retirement, and the agency ended a crucial door-knocking program, designed to reach people immediately after a disaster. All of this comes as President Donald Trump and his administration weigh even deeper cuts to the agency.Still very much in the throes of recovery from the 2023 and 2024 floods, the state, municipalities and individuals have depended on these federal funds to cover the cost of rebuilding. These  recent disasters show just how much the state draws from FEMA.“There’s a fear, too, of what happens if there’s flooding this summer,” said Sarah Henshaw, the coordinator for the Lamoille Area Recovery Network, or LeARN, a group created after the 2023 floods to help individuals navigate disaster recovery. “What are we going to do, as a community, when there is no FEMA?” she said. “The state has done (its) best to try to build out (its) systems, but the systems are reliant on FEMA.”The fears surround the state’s capacity to manage short-term response and long-term recovery — things like repairing roads and houses — if more disasters hit the state in the future. Though some residents worry about how the federal shakeup may affect long-term recovery payouts from past disasters, state officials confirmed that those efforts are moving forward without significant changes. Chief Recovery Officer Douglas Farnham testifies before the House Ways and Means Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on April 3, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“I think the most accurate way to phrase it right now is that our interaction with FEMA and our progress on obligations and disbursements is functioning or behaving pretty much how it did under the previous administration,” said Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer. Still, statements by federal officials and actions are fueling anxiety about the future of the agency, even as day-to-day payouts progress.During a May 20 congressional hearing, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem advocated for shifting the burden of disaster response onto states and away from FEMA, which is housed under her department. Her comments build on a sentiment Trump has advanced since the early days of his term to possibly eliminate FEMA.Since then, he’s proposed a barrage of cuts to the agency’s budget and workforce, including the end of a $750 million grant program that his earlier administration designed. Also, FEMA administrators said they had no plan to address the projected $8 billion deficit in the agency’s emergency fund during a recent congressional hearing. The cuts leave emergency managers wondering how — and if — FEMA will be able to help communities rebuild after the next big disaster.Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, and Assistant Secretary for Health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Admiral Rachel Levine tour flood damage on Severance Hill Road Lyndonville on August 5, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerExperts also worry about the agency’s capacity for short-term response, given that FEMA has sharply reduced training for those tasked with on-the-ground response, as Reuters reported, and canceled its door-knocking program. “The whole point of federal assistance is to bring in more humans, to bring in more bodies than the state(s) can provide themselves, especially in small states,” Farnham said. “So we just can’t shift our population, our workforce that much. We need help.”Federal support on past disastersFederal aid has been crucial in rebuilding from the 2023 and 2024 floods.FEMA’s disaster recovery payouts fall into two main categories: individual assistance and municipal assistance. The requests and reimbursements from federal disaster declarations in 2023 and 2024 in each category underscore how much the state, towns and individuals rely on federal support.The Pavilion Building in Montpelier is undergoing remediation after the floods on July 18, 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerFor the summer 2023 floods, FEMA dispersed $26.2 million to 3,616 Vermonters — that’s to provide support for things like reconstruction of homes, replacement of private roads or bridges lost, rental assistance, or even for more nuanced “other needs assistance” for things like kidney dialysis machines or space heaters that may have been damaged in a storm. The maximum amount an individual can receive from FEMA is $42,500, though many individuals saw damage in 2023 and 2024 that exceeded that amount.The window to file requests for more aid from FEMA related to the 2023 floods has now closed. “That doesn’t mean work is done. It just means that work (and) resources need to be identified with non-FEMA sources,” said Jason Gosselin, who coordinates the individual assistance program through the state’s Agency of Human Services. He underscored how FEMA is one piece, though a large one, of the multiple sources people draw from to recover — like their insurance, savings accounts and community recovery groups. The appeals and payouts for last summer’s floods are still moving forward. For the first first major July 2024 flood, FEMA has provided $12.1 million in assistance to 1,686 Vermonters and more than $1.7 million to 225 Vermonters for the later July floods that year. For both 2024 disasters, FEMA has 230 appeals open, as of mid-May, according to the agency’s regional office.The process for towns and cities to secure reimbursements is not unlike the process individuals take — but at the scale of municipal roads and bridges and multimillion dollar water treatment plants.“It can be harder to see the role that FEMA plays in supporting cities, towns, states in doing things like cleaning up debris, paying for first responder over time, paying for mass sheltering, even things like helping cover the costs of rebuilding schools and courthouses and other public buildings,” said Sarah Labowitz, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who focuses on disaster recovery data.   Once FEMA obligates the funds, the money goes to the Vermont Department of Emergency Management, which has its own approval process prior to distributing the money to applicants. Applications can get held up at any phase of this process, but collecting the right paperwork is particularly sticky. Workers from ReSource and the Montpelier Youth Conservation Corps clear mud out of a basement on Third Street in Barre on July 12, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“The issue many times is the issue of documentation: Many of these towns have a town administrator that is part time, works very few hours in the week and they may not have any background, or really working knowledge of how roads, culverts, ditches, embankments are constructed,” said Mark Johnson, the recovery section chief for Vermont Emergency Management. It’s part of why the expertise and continuity of FEMA assistance can be so crucial. For the 2023 disaster, FEMA has awarded more than $190.7 million to the state, to be dispersed across municipal and state projects, according to the agency’s regional office.Many of those projects are still in the early phases of rebuilding. “They’re still being written or formulated or created in a way that will meet all the guidelines,” Johnson said. “These are not the low-hanging fruit,” Johnson said of the projects that remain. “In other words, these are the tough ones — these are wastewater treatment facilities, these are things that, for whatever reason, have required more complicated (attention).” Among those mega projects are the repairs to the wastewater treatment facilities in Johnson, Hardwick and Ludlow.For the two major July 2024 floods, FEMA has committed around $13 million to the state for municipal recovery. State officials estimate that the total cost of damage to state and municipal property between 2023 and 2024 will total around $800 million — including the big summer floods and smaller, localized disasters.“The total changes every day. Until we have final agreement and close out projects, the numbers are going to continue to shift and morph around for several years,” Farnham said. “The things that FEMA hasn’t obligated yet are always going to be subject to change and adjustment.”Estimates for the total cost of the 2024 floods should stabilize sooner since those damages and repairs are less complicated than those of 2023, according to Farnham. “We didn’t have the major, major facility damage that we saw in 2023, so we don’t have the big wastewater treatment facility projects. Other than state highways, state (infrastructure) suffered minimal damage,” he said.One of the biggest unknowns and largest expense from the 2023 flooding is the reconstruction of the state Capitol complex, a collection of state government buildings damaged by the 2023 floods. Instead of fixing each building individually, the state has decided to address the repairs collectively and hopes to finalize its proposal by July 14. People photograph the flooded Winooski River in Montpelier on July 11, 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA future without FEMA? As these state and municipal projects move forward, and as individuals rebuild, the shadow of impending changes to FEMA — and what that might mean for future disasters — hangs heavy.The state, on its own, does not have the capacity to respond to the scale of future disasters without federal resources. Vermont received an average of $30.9 million in federal disaster funding over the past nine years. While that number may seem like a small share of the state’s operating budget — a little less than 1%, according to data from the Carnegie Endowment and interpreted by Axios —  it is one of the largest proportions in the country. Only six other states (including hurricane-prone Louisiana, Florida and Texas along with post-wildfire Hawaii) have higher shares of federal disaster funding compared with their overall state budget.“There are all kinds of efficiencies that we gain from having a federal system for disaster recovery,” Labowitz said. “We spread around the risk. We spread around the workforce capacity. We spread around the cost.” Workers remove a toilet from a flood-damaged home on Third Street in Barre on July 12, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger“Does Vermont need to create a standing workforce to respond to disasters? Even though disasters are relatively infrequent, it still needs a workforce to help respond to (disasters) when they do happen. Particularly for smaller states, that’s going to be really hard,” she added.However, the spate of disasters over the past two years has left Vermont relatively ready to react to extreme floods this summer, Farnham said. The danger, he said, is in the long term, if the state loses the institutional memory of preparedness, response and long-term recovery networks — especially if the federal structure changes.While boots on the ground workers are essential in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, FEMA’s staff or programs are not to blame for the existing bottle neck that prevents smooth, speedy long-term recovery, Farnham said.  The main barrier to FEMA working quickly is the accumulation of external regulations and environmental precautions that surround massive building projects. “Having fewer federal employees and the same regulations and policies is not going to be helpful,” Farnham said.Labowitz is watching and waiting for what a summer with a hollowed out FEMA may hold. To her, “It feels like a train that you can see coming from a long way away.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘We need help’: While tallying recent assistance, Vermont officials consider a future without FEMA.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/FEMA-1-20240903-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-29 06:04:17.954321

(Getty image)It’s no secret that Rhode Island isn’t leading the nation in business attraction — but it doesn’t have to be that way.
The Rhode Island Business Coalition has a vision of what is possible in the Ocean State. While the General Assembly has taken steps in recent years to improve the state’s business climate, more action is needed to position Rhode Island for success. 
To that end, we urge members of the General Assembly to give thoughtful consideration to how each proposal before them this year will shape the way existing businesses operate and influence whether new businesses choose to invest in our state. 
The current economic uncertainty makes it more important than ever to enact policies that promote economic vitality and make the Ocean State a more attractive place to do business. 
This legislative session, our coalition’s top legislative priorities for creating a business-friendly environment include: 1) lowering the cost of doing business in Rhode Island; 2) reducing the regulatory burden on employers; and 3) strengthening the state’s education system and workforce development pipeline. 
First, Rhode Island’s high tax burden must be addressed in order to create a climate that attracts investment, increases wages and encourages innovation. 
For businesses to succeed here, we need to improve the state’s overall tax climate. Eliminating the corporate minimum tax, increasing the estate tax exemption and resisting calls to increase personal income taxes, including for high earners, will help Rhode Island maintain and enhance its advantages with respect to neighboring states. 
Second, we must pursue regulatory reforms that streamline rules and legal requirements that businesses are forced to navigate, draining their time and money. States create strong business climates by limiting regulatory efforts to immediate threats to public safety and the environment.
Today, Rhode Island businesses are heavily burdened by onerous and outdated work requirements, including tying for the seventh highest minimum wage in the country and utility costs that are among the nation’s highest. Further, Rhode Island employers continue to face increasing health insurance costs, along with new mandated benefits, which add to the cost of premiums and leave fewer employers able to offer coverage to their employees. 
We have seen since the pandemic that businesses have changed how they operate. Many are more mobile than they were just a couple years ago. As a state, we need to enact policies that attract businesses, not drive them away. Let’s make it easier and less costly for businesses to operate, which will lead to increased investment and job creation. 










As a state, we need to enact policies that attract businesses, not drive them away.


Third, Rhode Island’s K-12 students must learn the skills they’ll need to succeed in the economy of tomorrow. We can make progress towards this by effectively adopting innovative, evidence-based curricula and making additional investments in high-quality professional development for our teachers. For students, expanding career and technical education (CTE) allows them to gain exposure, training and experience that will better prepare them for a career after graduation. 
Rhode Island’s business community is strong, but it needs our support to succeed. Whether at our Fortune 500 companies, or at the small shops that keep our Main Streets alive, people are going to work every day at Rhode Island companies across all sectors of the economy. 
This legislative session, let’s support our business environment by resisting calls to further burden Rhode Island businesses and enacting common-sense policies that make it easier for existing and new companies to operate, expand and invest — right here in our state.

Many of those same individuals were shocked in March when new property valuation notices showed what they saw as more of the same across the county.
Last week, the recently formed Orange County Property Tax Justice Coalition, shared data from the county’s largest historically Black communities that show significant “vertical regressivity,” meaning newer larger homes in those communities are undervalued while older homes are systematically overvalued.
“Orange County is way worse than I expected,” said Hudson Vaughan, director of the Community Justice Collaborative at the North Carolina Housing Coalition. “I thought, especially after the work that folks did with the tax office four years ago, that things would look much better this time around.”
A record of unjust valuations 
In 2021, activists in the Northside community found that property tax assessments of many new, larger student housing properties in Chapel Hill were lower than those of smaller homes owned by Black residents. According to Vaughan this is a common problem. He noted that in many established Black communities across the nation, homes are often undervalued for resale, bank loans and equity purposes, but over-assessed for property tax purposes.

Speaking at a recent virtual meeting held via Zoom, Vaughan said, “I think what you’ll see is that some of the student rentals in Northside got valued a little higher [in the recent revaluation], but across the county, the historically Black communities are way overvalued compared to other wealthier, historically white neighborhoods and without market justification.” Vaughan resides in the Northside neighborhood and helped lead the effort to bring fairness to tax assessments in 2021.
Northside residents’ efforts in 2021 eventually resulted in about a $7 million reduction in assessed home values. Meanwhile, under-assessed rental properties saw assessment increases of $5 million to $6 million.
Vaughan recently led property tax assessments examinations across the Research Triangle. He said several neighborhoods in Wake County and Durham have real problems. Throughout North Carolina, Vaughan said, many homeowners in the lowest price housing are affected. In some counties, he said, they are paying proportionally twice the property taxes of owners of the highest price housing.
“And yet, even though that’s the case, over four times as many high-income owners, primarily from white census tracts, appeal their tax values for being too high,” he said.
Vaughan shared an example from the current revaluation in Chapel Hill’s Northside community: On one side of the street, a home owned by a Black resident for more than 50 years that is 1,200 square-feet and more than 100 years old is valued at a higher rate for property taxes than investor-owned property directly across the street. The investor’s property has a duplex with a detached home behind it. Together, the investor-owned property contains at least eight bedrooms and totals 2,900 square feet. The smaller home’s taxable value is $656,00 compared to $652,000 for the larger duplex and detached home across the street.
“The homeowner on the left [the Black homeowner] will end up paying higher property taxes as a result of this valuation,” Vaughan said.
He projects a $2 million total increase in property taxes for the historically Black neighborhoods he and other advocates have looked at, even if the county adopts a revenue neutral tax rate.
“We’ve already heard Orange County and Chapel Hill and Carrboro talk about how they’re going to have to raise taxes, likely this year for very good reason, and we are in support of that, but it cannot be on the backs of the historically Black neighborhoods,” Vaughan said.
The county responds
County tax administrator Nancy Freeman said her office explained to Vaughan and the coalition that when issues are found to be prevalent throughout several properties in appeals, that information can be taken to the Board of Equalization and Review for its consideration.
“We can show them that we see there is a problem with all of these properties, or there could be problems with all of these properties that are still under appeal, and we would like for you [the Board of Equalization and Review] to direct us to review this property or this neighborhood again,” Freeman said. “That’s how we would be able to go back and review the property and make adjustments, if needed, and make corrections to all affected properties in that neighborhood.”
After a preliminary review of the information provided by Vaughan and the coalition, however, Freeman said her office isn’t seeing any “prevailing issues” with properties it has been able to identify and review.
“That’s not to say there are not problems within that need some attention but at this moment we’ve not completed a review and at this moment, the ones that we’ve looked at, there’s nothing that’s prevalent from all of them at this point,” Freeman said.
So far, Freeman said there have been 3,500 informal property valuation appeals, with more than 200 formal appeals, which are made to the Board of Equalization and Review after an informal review of a property’s tax value.
“We suspect we might get another 500 [formal appeals] before the end of July [when the appeal filing deadline closes],” Freeman said.   
Activists gather online
The virtual meeting at which Vaughan held forth was hosted by the Orange County Property Tax Justice Coalition. The coalition is made up of community organizers from historically Black neighborhoods across Orange County including Councilville, Mars Hill, Fairview, Rogers Road, Piney Grove, Efland-Cheeks, Cedar Grove, Northside, Pine Knolls, Tin Top, and Glosson/Davie Rd.
The effort is supported by The Marian Cheek Jackson Center, the Rogers-Eubanks Neighborhood Association, Justice United, Habitat for Humanity, and The Community Justice Collaborative of the NC Housing Coalition.

“These historically Black neighborhoods are some of the most historic, culturally diverse, and, you know, are the spaces of remaining affordability within the county,” said George Barrett, a former Northside resident and executive director of the Marian Cheek Jackson Center.
“Our neighborhoods and our communities hold so much history and so much connection and love and spirit,” Barrett said. “Our communities and our neighborhoods are…the ones who are facing an intense amount of threat by these new revaluations. In these existing hubs of the Black community within Orange County…we, as a coalition…have formed to fight back against this and really preserve the future of our neighborhoods in the midst of these current revaluations”
Horace Johnson Jr., the son and namesake of Hillsborough’s first and only Black mayor who recently died, warned those on the Zoom call that he would be blunt in his assessment of the revaluation.

“This is extinction level gentrification,” Johnson said.
He called the assessments “mind numbing,” a phrase he said he reserves for things that cannot be reasonably explained.
Johnson said Hillsborough leaders are using high taxes to turn the town into an “OAW” community.
“OAW represents old and white, specifically for Hillsborough, a town that’s rich in tradition,” Johnson said. “I’ve been here all my life. They’re trying to turn this community to old and white, which brings it back to class, the have and the have nots.”
Johnson said his late father would not want him to just “weep and mourn.” He’d want him to continue to fight against injustice.
  Judge Beverly Scarlett (Photo: Screenshot from online meeting)
Retired District Court Judge Beverly Scarlett joined the meeting and said high property taxes can make owning a home unaffordable for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, who might be forced to put off buying medication to pay bills.
“I’ve seen this within my own family, [where someone] will decide ‘I’m not going to buy my medication because I need to put together money, put my pennies together to be able to pay these taxes’ — that’s going to lead to negative health outcomes,” Scarlett said.
Vaughan said the good news is that tax offices can make neighborhood adjustments, and many other counties have.
“Guilford County adjusted land values in a historically Black neighborhood when they realized the land values were wrong,” he said. “Wake County is currently looking at two neighborhoods that had much more complicated differences and yet were problematic for a lot of the long standing historically Black residents.”
Durham is also looking at systematic tools, and all of the counties have access to the regressivity tools that Vaughan shared. “Orange County decided not to use the tool this time and made huge mistakes,” Vaughan said.
Barrett said more than 100 residents from across the county have signed a letter to county commissioners asking for fairness and justice on property tax assessments.
“We want to see these neighborhood wide adjustments in historically Black and Brown neighborhoods be made and we want to also have a revisitation of undervalued, wealthier neighborhoods,” Barrett said. “Investor-owned buildings should carry their fair share of the property tax burden.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-4-1024x524.jpeg,,,2025-05-29 06:04:17.954321

(Photo by Getty Images)As Virginia prepares to revise its academic benchmarks for students, a select group will consider how quickly the state should implement its proficiency ratings.
The committees could recommend either a single-year transition or a more gradual approach over several years. However, any decision could significantly impact how schools, students, and communities respond.
Implementing the changes over a year could have immediate effects but might also lead to rushed decisions. A phased approach over several years could help reduce anomalies, but may delay schools from receiving timely interventions.
“The (Board of Education) hasn’t made a policy decision yet on how they’re going to do that,” Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson told The Mercury. 
Gullickson did not indicate her preference on the matter but said a subject expert will analyze data from other states that have taken similar approaches. A presentation is expected in June when the standard-setting committees meet.
The committees include teachers, instructional specialists, and community stakeholders, such as parents and business leaders. In June, the members will make recommendations to the board for an initial review, with a final decision expected in July.
Virginia’s effort to change the cut scores — the threshold for determining student proficiency — is part of a broader push by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration to raise academic benchmarks and “restore excellence in education.” The plan includes increasing rigor in core subjects, boosting transparency and accountability, and overhauling the state’s assessment system.
The administration aims to align the new cut scores more closely with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which it says highlights the “honesty gap” — the disparity between Virginia’s current standards and the more stringent NAEP benchmarks. NAEP measures academic performance in grades 4, 8, and 12, using a randomly selected sample designed to reflect student diversity across factors like ethnicity, school size, economic background, and gender.
Between 2017 and 2022, Virginia’s fourth-grade reading and math results showed a stunning 40-percentage-point gap between the state’s Standards of Learning assessment tests and NAEP assessments.

According to the latest NAEP results for Virginia, 8% of Black students and 13% of Hispanic students tested proficient in 8th-grade math. In 4th-grade math, 19% of Black students and 27% of Hispanic students reached proficiency. 
The governor has attributed these results to the previous Board of Education lowering cut scores and altering school accreditation standards. However, Democrats have defended the prior approach.
A change would not take effect until the spring of 2026. Board members are still in the early stages of considering their options.
Anne Holton, a former state education secretary and a current member of the Board of Education member appointed by former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, said that while she is looking forward to seeing what the superintendent and committees recommend, she’s disappointed the governor’s administration has not adequately communicated the potential changes to the public — especially because they are likely going to be unpopular.
The Youngkin administration wants Virginia to meet NAEP’s “proficient” standard, which is — defined as a student demonstrating a deeper understanding of complex topics and the ability to apply them in real-world situations.
In response to Holton’s question at the board’s recent work session, Marianne Perie, founder of Measurement in Practice LLC and a technical advisor on standard setting, said that aligning Virginia’s standards with the NAEP benchmark would increase the student failure rate. Holton said the rate could rise to about 68% — resulting in dramatic changes in the commonwealth. 
“You need the public to understand that this is not suddenly your child is dumber than he was last year or that your school is worse than last year, but rather that we’re changing the grading scale, causing this change,” Holton said.
However, board member Andy Rotherham, a Youngkin appointee, warned of an “inevitable result” if the state delays action. Speaking at the board’s May 21 work session, he said the state has been telling the public that 90% of Virginia’s schools are “doing fine” when fewer than one in five Black and Hispanic eight-grade students are proficient.
“We’re either going to have a reckoning for that or not,” Rotherham said, urging the board to continue its push for greater transparency and honesty about how students are performing on assessments. 
“The question should not be about that; it should be what we are going to do for those kids, what we are going to do for those communities, what we are going to do for those families,” Rotherham said. 
“Those are the kinds of policy conversations that we should be having, not trying to square this circle where we’ve been telling people that almost every school is great when you have these astounding gaps in achievement, and this astounding gap overall in terms of what we’ve been saying is proficient and what is not.”
Rotherham said he looks forward to hearing from the committees. He did not endorse a specific  implementation method but emphasized the importance of raising standards in a way that educators can manage — without postponing a decision.
“The only thing I’m not open to is kicking the can down the road or not being transparent with parents and communities about where we are,” Rotherham said. 
“There are multiple ways to do this, and that’s why we need to have a conversation that’s not getting everybody riled up that ‘all the kids are going to fail next year,’ or whatever. (It needs to be) thoughtful, and I have confidence in Emily Anne on that.”
The Mercury learned that several of Virginia’s most prominent education associations share the board’s commitment to high standards and accountability for students, but have not taken a position on how quickly the state should implement any proficiency ratings.
Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association (VEA), said in a statement that changes in performance benchmarks have consequences and should only be considered with great care and caution.  
“There’s no need to rush this process for political purposes,” Bauer said. “Before any moves are made, we need significant research into how changing cut scores will affect not only student success, but graduation rates, the new Performance and Support Framework, and funding that’s tied to SOL outcomes.” 
On May 16, a statewide coalition of 12 education associations signed a letter urging the Board of Education to consider the broader implications of raising the cut scores on Virginia’s SOL assessments. Areas of potential impact include the state budget, the new accountability system, and graduation rates. 
The organizations include the Virginia Association for Teaching, Learning and Leading, Virginia PTA, Virginia School Board Association, Virginia Associations of Secondary School Principals, School Superintendents, and Elementary School Principals and VEA.
“Our coalition supports rigorous expectations; we do not advocate lowering the bar for learning,” the letter states. 
“However, we believe any changes to SOL cut scores must be approached with great care, thorough, extensive modeling of student performance impacts as well as transparency around the impact of the new cut scores on state budget funding streams tied to SOL outcomes, graduation rates, and the new Performance and Support Framework.” 
The coalition added that significant shifts in performance benchmarks without extensive modeling could carry “far-reaching consequences.” It urged the board to “fully analyze and communicate these impacts to all education stakeholders, especially parents, before moving forward.”

Kennedy Jr. has spearheaded a national movement to “make America healthy again,” including a plan to phase out synthetic dyes from foods, which have been linked to adverse effects in children. Virginia lawmakers also worked on a law to ban synthetic dyes from foods in public schools that Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed this spring.
Youngkin signs bipartisan law banning synthetic dyes in school meals

But cuts to the federal agencies responsible for food regulation are alarming, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, said on a call Wednesday, and work against the food safety and the public health goals Kennedy has professed. 
The Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention play key roles in regulating the nation’s food supply — from packaged products like baby formula, to produce, to animal products like meat and eggs. Entities like the FDA and USDA ensure consumer protection through inspections, while the CDC  investigates sources of foodborne illness outbreaks. From there, the Department of Justice can prosecute those responsible for related mistakes, if needed. 
But in recent months a DOJ unit that handles such cases was disbanded, several data-tracking divisions of CDC have been cut, a President Joe Biden-era rule limiting salmonella levels in raw poultry has been withdrawn, and two USDA food safety advisory committees were dismantled. The cuts are part of overall shrinking efforts spearheaded by Trump advisor Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and hamper transparency concerning food safety, Hashmi said. 
She cited a Washington Post report about an Indiana boy who nearly died after eating a salad due to an E. coli outbreak that had been traced last fall but not publicly disclosed since Trump’s administration took office. 
A lawsuit against the grower of the lettuce in the salad filed by the boy’s parents last month said the bacteria affecting the child was a match to the strain that killed a person and sickened about 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies then investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce. A February 2025 internal FDA memo linked a single lettuce producer and ranch as the contamination source, but officials never issued public recommendations or identified the grower after the investigation.   
“The FDA, under the Trump and RFK administration, have decided not to name names or make the public aware of the dangers. The parents deserve and we deserve accountability,” Hashmi said.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Meanwhile, one of the two FDA committees that were dismantled had been tasked with reviewing the regulatory process in the wake of a deadly Listeria outbreak in a Virginia-based Boar’s Head facility that occurred last year. 
After highlighting these challenges,  Hashmi and Sickles laid out their ideas for actions state lawmakers could take. 
Both suggested legislators pursue updates to Virginia law that could constitute  state-level food regulations. As chair of the Senate’s Education and Health committee, Hashmi said she’s already pursuing similar measures when it comes to special education standards in Virginia to “fill gaps” created at the federal level. 
But Sarah Sorscher, a regulatory affairs director with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, emphasized that even if states like Virginia pursue state-level regulations, the nature of interstate food supply chains means there would still be gaps in consumer protections. 
“We can’t rely on states to take care of issues, because food could be coming in, being served to Virginia consumers that’s made in other states that have weaker protections,” Sorscher said. “So that’s sort of a failure of using the state system to address food safety.”
Still, Sickles thinks there are strategies Virginia could explore to bolster consumer protections when it comes to food safety. He said that state legislators haven’t been as hands-on because of federal oversight on the matter, but that he now plans to keep a closer eye on the issue, and wants his 139 colleagues in the General Assembly to do the same.
As chair of the House of Delegates’ Health and Human Services committee, Sickles is planning a July “boot camp” gathering that will focus on social services and the state’s health department. 
“We need to spend more time looking more closely into areas like this and we than we ever have before our committee,” Sickles explained.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)From snipes about turning the great white north into the 51st state to booing during “The Star-Spangled Banner,” the U.S. relationship with its northern neighbor and closest ally has seemingly soured since the election of President Donald Trump.
However Pete Hoekstra, the United States ambassador to Canada, offered a significantly more positive outlook during the Mackinac Policy Conference Wednesday, telling the attendees that Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are aligned in their goals of revitalizing each of their nation’s economies.
“Can you imagine what happens in North America if the Canadian economy is booming and the U.S. economy is booming at the same time?” Hoekstra asked.
“We’ve got strong leadership, committed to economic growth, committed to the same types of economic principles who want to get to a deal. That gives me a lot of optimism,” Hoekstra said.
However, there are some obstacles, Hoekstra said, notably pointing to the lack of a pro-American trade voice in Canada, noting that several provinces have banned the sale of American alcohol in retaliation to Trump’s tariff policies.
These issues are pebbles in the shoes, Hoekstra said, predicting that the U.S. and Canada would mend fences sooner rather than later.
Carney appears to be serious about meeting Canada’s NATO defense spending targets, Hoekstra said, and Canada has shown interest in participating in the United States’ “Golden Dome” missile defense system.
In contrast to Hoekstra’s optimism, Carney recently was quoted as saying that the “process of deepening integration” with the U.S. is “over” and that Canada was in a position now “where we co-operate when necessary, but not necessarily co-operate.”
Jacques Shore, a partner in the Ottawa-based law firm Gowling WLG, told Michigan Advance that Carney’s stance is one born out of necessity.
Shore, a past leader of the firm’s National Government Affairs Group, said that while Hoekstra has been making an effort to actually meet Canadians, which is appreciated, in and of itself it can’t erase the downturn in relations.
“I would say the pebbles in the shoes are relatively recent, because they have really come about as a result of a new focus of the President in the way in which he views Canada,” Shore said.
In reaction to Hoekstra’s comments, Shore said there is a sense that what had been a strong partnership between the two nations is now under some risk because of what’s been said by Trump, but that’s not to say that Canada is not “absolutely engaged” in wishing to do everything it can to restore the relationship.
However, Shore says the President’s comments about making Canada a 51st state do not sit well with citizens of a proud and sovereign nation.
“I think that our Prime Minister said it extremely well when he made the comment that he has through the last election period spoken with the owners of Canada, which is obviously the citizens of Canada, and I don’t think he necessarily even needed to have a campaign to see that Canadians are perfectly happy being Canadians, having the country that they have, continuing to build the country they have, without becoming part of the United States,” Shore said.
Regardless, Hoesktra said while negotiations won’t be easy, the U.S. and Canada could both see benefits to their manufacturing and energy industries if they reach a deal.
Joining Hoekstra on stage, WOOD-TV reporter Rick Albin pressed the ambassador on the speed bumps on reaching a deal, and whether this would be a short term or long term concern.
“I think the president, and from what I’m hearing from my Canadian sources, are that the President and the Prime Minister would like to get to a resolution sooner rather than later,” Hoekstra said, emphasizing the American and Canadian jobs at stake.
When asked if the U.S. and Canada could reach a zero sum deal or if tariffs would remain on both sides, Hoekstra said the president had made it clear there would be tariffs for every country looking to do business with the U.S.
However, in negotiating with his Canadian colleagues, Hoekstra said there’s no reason why trade between the U.S. and Canada couldn’t be the least restrictive in the world in regards to tariffs.

Sometimes, it’s hard to keep track of the wild policy swings that are the signatures of the second Trump administration. From tariffs and trade to Russia and Ukraine, it often takes just hours for supposedly strong policy stances to be contradicted or abandoned by the president or his aides.
And now, this chaotic pattern is directly impacting North Carolina.
Both last fall and this past January, Trump blasted the Biden administration’s response to Hurricane Helene and made bold promises that he would rebuild storm-ravaged areas better than ever.
Unfortunately, that was then and this is now. This fact was made clear last week when the administration abruptly turned off the federal funding spigot by rejecting Gov. Josh Stein’ request to continue providing matching funds for the state’s Helene recovery appropriations.
The decision leaves the state on the hook for $200 million or more in additional expenses for debris cleanup and other emergency work.
The bottom line: Once again, the president has said one thing and done another, and sadly, North Carolinians will pay the price.

(Photo by Cappi Thompson/Getty Images)Every fall, winter ticks in New England sit on shrubs or other plants waiting for a large animal to pass by so they can latch on and begin sucking out blood. This has a huge impact on the area’s moose, wildlife biologists say.
“They basically become zombies and die,” Eric Orff, a New Hampshire-based wildlife biologist, said. “We have zombie moose.”
According to estimates from New Hampshire Fish and Game, the Granite State’s moose population peaked in the late 1990s at around 7,000 to 8,000 moose. It has since declined to roughly 3,000 to 4,000.
Most tick species move from host to host frequently, but winter ticks find a moose, deer, or other animal around November and extract their blood for the entirety of winter. And it’s not just one or a couple ticks on each host. Rather, hundreds or thousands of ticks often latch onto a host. This is a process called questing and it has a huge effect on moose, particularly calves.
“April is the month of death for calves,” Orff, who works as a field biologist at the National Wildlife Federation and serves as vice president of the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation, said. “The adult ticks are feeding one more time before they fall off and they basically drain the moose’s supply of blood.”
Around April, the female ticks fall off their hosts to lay their eggs. If they land on snow as opposed to dry land, the eggs are less fruitful. However, as climate change represses winter weather, tick populations have boomed.
“Over the last 20 years, instead of one winter out of six or eight or 10 being truncated, now, a majority of them are,” Orff said. “So what has been found in more recent moose studies, including those done in New Hampshire and in Maine and Vermont the last two decades, is that it really significantly impacts the moose calves born that previous spring.”
While adult moose are better able to fend off the tick infestations, he said, 70% of calves don’t make it to 1 year old. And this also affects adult female moose. Orff, who has been studying moose and other wildlife for decades, said that when he and his colleagues began this research in the 1980s, nearly all older female moose gave birth to two calves. Now, he said, less than half the females even become pregnant. He said this is a result of being underweight from the ticks, but also because climate change is making summers warmer, which results in them eating less. Underweight moose are less likely to give birth.
“It’s really a double whammy,” he said.
A third factor, he said, is that south of the White Mountains brain worms have proliferated. While moose populations have plummeted, white-tail deer populations have nearly tripled from about 40,000 in the early 1980s to around 100,000 to 120,000 in the southern half of the state due to milder winters, he said. Brain worms are common in deer, and while those brain worms don’t harm the deer, they can be fatal to moose.
Orff noted the economic costs of lower moose populations. He said people used to travel to the North Country specifically to see the moose.
“Moose viewing in New Hampshire for a period of years was a $10-million-a-year industry,” he said. “I don’t know if there’s any companies that still do it. I think there are. But you used to be able to go out and, in a night, see a dozen or a half dozen moose at least. Now they may go several hours and see no moose.”
These die-offs also cause ecological issues. Henry Jones, moose project leader for Fish and Game, said moose carcasses serve as a food source for scavengers, which are seeing rising numbers in the wake of this population collapse. Jones said the past two years have been particularly severe for tick infestations.
To address this, the state is issuing more hunting permits. Jones said tick populations rise when the moose population has high density. By killing off moose, the survivors fare better, he said. The state is also working with the University of New Hampshire to study the conditions in which ticks proliferate best. Jones said this is all about “keeping them from getting really high density and causing this kind of cyclic relationship of lots of tick mortality.”
However, the hunting strategy still results in dead moose and low populations. Orff noted the conundrum.
“I guess that’s the debate,” Orff said. “Is it better to have far fewer moose and less sickly moose? … Baby moose who drop dead from no blood in April or taking some of them out that will be utilized by hunters eating them?”
Jones said the state is acting based on the wishes of citizens.
“We did a public survey to understand what the residents want with the moose population in 2024,” Jones said. “People want there to be the same or more moose, but they don’t want there to be more moose if they’re unhealthy.”
Still, Orff said none of these are a true solution to the overall problem. Moose will continue dying, he said, until we put an end to humans’ warming of the planet.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mooseticks-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 06:04:17.954321

(Photo courtesy of Andrews campaign)A Lowcountry pediatrician is again running for a spot on Capitol Hill, this time aiming for the U.S. Senate seat held by Lindsey Graham, she announced Thursday.
Annie Andrews, who spent 15 years at the Medical University of South Carolina and attempted in 2022 to oust U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, is the second Democrat to announce a bid to topple Graham next year.
“I believe in South Carolina. I believe in the kids and families that I’ve served for years, and I’m not afraid to take on the people who’ve sold them out, and I’m starting with Lindsey Graham,” Andrews told the SC Daily Gazette ahead of her announcement.
Andrews touted her medical experience during her 2022 run and will do so again amid debate in Washington over Republicans’ efforts to slash spending in President Donald Trump’s second term.
An overhaul of Medicaid in the massive bill passed by the U.S. House last week by a single vote would cut spending on the government-run health insurance program by a projected $625 billion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
“I am watching in real time as our health care system is being completely dismantled by conspiracy theorists and drifters who have no business being anywhere near our public health system,” Andrews said. “I’ve seen both Republicans and Democrats watch and treat this as normal politics, which is not what this is at all.”
Andrews first ventured into politics for the 2022 election, hoping to flip the coastal 1st District blue again after Mace brought it back to the GOP in 2020, defeating one-term Democrat Joe Cunningham.
But Andrews lost by nearly 14 percentage points as Mace swept every county in the district in the first election following the Legislature’s decennial redrawing of congressional voting lines. In a split ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld those lines last year.
In September 2022, weeks before voters cast their ballot, Andrews took a leave of absence from her role at MUSC due to political attacks during the election.
The following June, less than two months after announcing the creation of a political action committee dedicated to supporting children, Andrews announced her departure from MUSC.
Andrews lives in Mount Pleasant but works part time at Children’s National Hospital in Washington D.C. And she’s active on social media, accruing more than 100,000 followers across Instagram and X, formerly Twitter.
However, that pales in comparison to Graham’s 2.2 million followers on X alone, with another 164,000 on Instagram.
Taking on Graham, a fundraising juggernaut with $15.9 million in his campaign account, according to his latest FEC filings and Trump’s endorsement, will be no easy task for any Democrat in a state in its biggest red wave in four decades.
But Andrews says it’s possible. Despite being the Senate Budget Committee chairman and one of the GOP’s most visible faces, he remains divisive.
In Andrews’ eyes, that makes him vulnerable.
“Republicans are just as fed up with the corruption in career politicians like Lindsey Graham in Washington D.C. as Democrats are,” she said.
Mark Lynch, a Greenville businessman who invested $5 million of his own money into his campaign as of the end of March, is Graham’s lone Republican primary challenger so far.
It’s likely that more Republicans will jump into the race. Graham usually draws multiple challengers in elections.
Upstate Democrat announces bid to unseat Lindsey Graham

Graham’s re-election campaign is co-chaired by Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.
Before she gets to Graham, Andrews will have to defeat Lee Johnson, a Greenville engineer, for the Democratic nomination.
In a statement, Johnson said he welcomes anybody to the race and wants to find the best candidate to defeat Graham.
“My focus remains squarely on the mission: retiring Lindsey Graham with someone who shows up, listens, and delivers for all of South Carolina,” the statement said.
When asked why she should be the Democratic nominee, Andrews said, “I’m a doctor. I’m a mom. I’m not a career politician. I’ve been serving kids and families in South Carolina from every corner of South Carolina for 15 years, and I’m in this fight for those kids and families.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AndrewsLaunch-Annie-203-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-29 06:04:17.954321

(Photo by Stacey Plaisance/Tulane University)NEW ORLEANS, La. – Mississippi River ships and barges carry over 500 million tons of cargo through the Southwest Pass shipping channel at the river’s end to reach major ports that handle 18% of U.S. waterborne commerce. For almost 100 years, levees and other human-made flood control structures have lined the banks of the river, obstructing its land-building silt, sand and clay from naturally rebuilding land along coastal Louisiana.
That sediment is essential to rebuilding — or at this point, maintaining — the fragile coastline that has been receding for decades. Without it, the small towns that dot the lower part of the Louisiana Gulf Coast are left exposed, with no protection against storm surges and hurricane-strength winds. But to reverse coastal erosion, scientists found that they first had to understand where sediment that could be used to rebuild settles instead.
Most of the year, less than 10% of the river’s sediment reaches the critical Bird’s Foot Delta, according to scientists from the Mississippi River Delta Transition Initiative, known as MissDelta. The bird’s foot —at the southernmost reach of the river system that juts into the Gulf of Mexico — plays a vital role in coastal protection, navigation, fisheries and energy infrastructure.

In 2023, MissDelta launched a $22 million, five-year research project spearheaded by Tulane University and Louisiana State University, and funded by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The study aims to evaluate the Delta and Southwest Pass, the critical navigation channel, with hopes of finding management approaches that will benefit both the delicate ecosystem and the people who live and work in the delta region, including fishers, charter-boat operators, offshore workers, shipyard builders, mechanics and petrochemical-facility operators.
During the first year-and-a-half of the study, researchers measured discharge by plunging a 200-pound sampler into the river at various depths. By tracking sediment from the sampler, the team can measure how much settles in the wetlands upriver versus how much exits into the deepwater Gulf, said Claire Kemick, a Tulane graduate student working to collect the samples.
The study’s early findings, announced at Louisiana’s State of the Coast conference, show that the Mississippi River loses substantial amounts of water and sediment above what’s called the Head of Passes, at the mouth of the river, where the Mississippi forms its distinct bird’s foot by branching into three directions: the Southwest Pass shipping channel (west), Pass A Loutre (east) and South Pass (center).
That means the Bird’s Foot Delta is headed toward further degradation, after losing ground for decades, said Mead Allison, co-lead of MissDelta and a professor in Tulane’s Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering.
Above the Head of Passes, substantial amounts of sediment carried by the Mississippi River are lost through both natural and manmade channels, such as the rapidly expanding Neptune Pass near Buras, Louisiana, in lower Plaquemines Parish. But most is lost well before then.
Using data on sediment movement, the team can calibrate models to predict what will happen to the delta by 2100 under different scenarios, with varied sea-level rise, storm frequency and river-flow fluctuations. Once the researchers develop the models, they will use them to test various interventions that could save the delta, such as closing river exits and changing water-flow patterns.
In the fall, the MissDelta team will return to lower Plaquemines Parish to study the saltwater wedge that creeps up the river during low flow periods. For three years in a row, the wedge of heavy salt water has crept up the river underneath the fresh water, imperiling drinking water in the greater New Orleans area.
The goal is to find management approaches that can help build up this region, which Allison has called one of the most threatened places in the nation, if not on Earth.
But they cannot forge management solutions without an understanding of how the muddy Mississippi carries its load of sandy sediment in the lower delta. “Right now, we don’t know very much about where the sediment is in the Lower Mississippi River,” Kemick said. Further research will help determine where the coarse sand is settling in the riverbed.
Sediment loss is especially high during low or average river flow, when the water is traveling slowly enough to allow the heavy sand particles to sink to the bottom. When the river floods, the faster-moving river brings sand from throughout the drainage basin to Louisiana. But it doesn’t necessarily help to build up the Bird’s Foot area. Instead, it falls out in the channel, creating a need for more dredging to maintain the ship route.
The Mississippi River’s sediment is an important resource for coastal restoration, Allison said. “Sand is white gold for Louisiana. We need to keep it.”

The Louisiana Coastal Master Plan was built upon this principle, with an ambitious plan for a sediment diversion, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, that would be one of the largest environmental infrastructure projects in the history of the U.S.
But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has suspended the permit to build the keystone project.
On May 21, more than 50 Louisiana business and civic leaders sent a letter to Gov. Jeff Landry urging him to resume construction of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion at the size and scale it was designed and permitted for.
“These business and civic leaders are part of the backbone of Louisiana— people who live, work, and invest in this region every day,” said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta. “Delaying or downsizing the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion threatens not just our coast, but our economy, our safety and our credibility as a state.”
Conversations about the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion were absent from this year’s State of the Coast conference, an interdisciplinary forum hosted by the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana.
“In some ways, I feel like Mid-Barataria is kind of haunting this conference,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation. She is hopeful Louisiana can find a pathway to resume the project, after investing $500 million into planning.
The state is also in danger of losing billions in federal funding if its leaders don’t commit to finishing the construction.
It may be time to look for alternative coastal restoration projects, some scientists say. For Allison, that means not only determining how the Mississippi River sediment moves now but also where dredged sand could best restore coastal wetlands like the Barataria Basin.
Currently, dredge spoil used for coastal restoration remains relatively close to where it came from in the river. In the Barataria Basin, one project to restore approximately 302 acres of brackish marsh known as Bayou Grande Cheniere required nearly eight miles of pipes to move the sediment.
Other solutions might involve closing gaps where sediment leaks out before reaching the Bird’s Foot Delta. The Army Corps is essentially testing this theory now, Allison said, with its plan to reduce the flow at Neptune Pass, a nearby branch in the river that is creating new land in Quarantine Bay.
The plan could boost land-building in the Barataria Basin, Allison said. While the Army Corps proposes using rocks to limit the size of the channel’s entrance and minimize the risk of navigational hazards, the construction at the outflow could reinforce the crevasse’s land-building power, he said.
In addition to building sediment retention structures, the Army Corps could pump sand out of the river and place it directly at the outflow of the channel, allowing the water to redistribute it into a more natural wetland building pattern.
“It’s really encouraging that the Corps is thinking about these forward-looking strategies to better use dredged material,” Allison said.

An analysis of the Ohio House Republican budget proposal shows it would result in more than $565 million in lost funds for Appalachian school districts over the next two years and a loss of $2.75 billion for public schools statewide, compared to the Fair School Funding Plan that’s been in place the past two budget cycles.
The Ohio Senate is currently working on a state operating budget draft that would spell out, among other things, how the chamber thinks public and private education should be funded by the state.
The big question right now is whether Ohio Republican lawmakers will keep to the Fair School Funding Plan that was passed with bipartisan support four years ago and included a six-year phase-in, or whether they will abandon it before the third and final phase. Republicans control supermajorities in both chambers of the Ohio Statehouse.
Support for the Fair School Funding Plan
Ohio House Republicans have already laid out their proposal. It does not include a continuation of the Fair School Funding Plan, which distributes support based on a funding formula that takes into account individual district needs, student demographics, and poverty rates, among other categories.
The House budget proposal gives schools an additional $226 million, which House Finance Chair Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said would be an increase from 2025 funding.
Democrats and Fair School Funding Plan advocates say that with inflation schools need much more than that to be fully funded, based on the needs identified as part of the funding plan’s data. A fully-funded increase would be between $666 million and $800 million, they say.
School board members from across the state signed on to a letter organized by advocacy group All In for Ohio Kids, asking that the legislature go back to the Fair School Funding plan.
The members write that the funding formula “is working as intended,” and that it “provides an equitable and transparent foundation for a shared responsibility between the state and local communities to support public education for the nearly 90% of Ohio students attending public schools.”
“Alarmingly, provisions in the current state budget for (fiscal year) 2026-2027 threaten the integrity of the (fair funding plan), leaving many districts, especially those with limited local tax bases, struggling to meet rising costs and educational demands,” the letter stated. “These changes risk stalling progress, undermining the formula’s effectiveness and disrupting local school districts’ ability to plan responsibly for the long term.”
Appalachian Ohio
School districts from urban, suburban, and rural regions all stand to be impacted. But the Appalachian region’s districts could face cuts that would dramatically change the way education is provided in an area with limited resources as it is.
Tom Gibbs, Ph.D., superintendent of the Athens City School District, has spent two decades of his career in education working in Appalachian districts, and during that time, he’s seen several “funding mechanisms” put in place for public education, but he’s also seen the different challenges schools and districts face, specifically Appalachian schools.
“Obviously, two of the biggest challenges are, one, poverty … and the other is that you’re spread out, so everything is hindered by transportation (needs) and technology access,” Gibbs said.

He said Athens is unique with its location near and connection to Ohio University, but the district still has its share of needs. He’s in favor of the Fair School Funding Plan because it’s “research-based,” and based in the local-level facts of each school district, he said.
“I do have some concerns that we’re moving away from a formula again,” Gibbs said, adding that he’s worried about plans to reduce taxes that help school districts, and talks of requiring schools to return carryover funds after a cap.
An analysis by the Ohio River Valley Institute found that the Ohio House budget proposal would result in more than $565 million in lost funds over the next two years for Appalachian public schools, “yielding the lowest state share of school funding in Ohio’s history,” the institute said.
Because it “ignores inflation and eliminates targeted funding for districts with wealth disparities or districts that lose students to private schools,” the analysis found the Ohio House Republican plan would underfund public schools statewide by $2.75 billion.
“We’re risking putting our students and teachers even further behind other states,” said the study’s author, Nick Messenger, an economist and senior researcher for the Ohio River Valley Institute.
Messenger used state budget data and funding projections from think tank Policy Matters Ohio to focus his analysis on counties in Ohio served by the Appalachian Regional Commission.
The biggest change over fiscal years 2026 and 2027 would be seen in Mahoning County, according to Messenger’s research. Using the Fair School Funding Plan, schools there would receive $262.5 million. Under the House proposal, the district would only see $166.6 million.
Athens County would receive $72.45 million under the Fair School Funding Plan model, the analysis found. Under the House proposal, schools there would see $52.8 million.
Federal funding
In addition to state uncertainty, Gibbs also said any change in funding on the federal level to public education, for which Athens receives about $1 million from “various funding streams,” would impact their ability to provide tutoring and specialized programs, like special education.
Policy Matters Ohio said the state’s public schools receive $3 billion per year in federal funding, about 11.6% of public school revenue.
Much of the federal funding schools like Athens receive is based on their participation in the free and reduced-lunch programs, eligibility for which is based on the income level of a student’s household. Athens has higher levels of eligibility for the program than some other districts, therefore their funding can be used for “school-wide” programs, according to Gibbs.
“We have some flexibility to implement programs, which means reading intervention, math intervention,” Gibbs said. “Any reduction in that funding stream is going to have a negative impact on the additional tutoring support services we provide.”
Seeing decreases in state aid and federal aid, along with possible limits in how districts can raise local funding would be challenging, he said, “and we could be creating an environment where more schools have to go back to the ballot more often.”
Ohio Statehouse lawmakers have until the end of June to develop a final budget draft to send to the governor for his signature. The Ohio Senate’s Finance Committee, which leads the chamber’s budget development, is hearing from not only school districts, but Ohioans speaking on behalf of topics like public libraries, disability rights, parks and recreation, and food banks throughout the week, with hearings currently scheduled through Friday.

In many communities, these initiatives have been credited with saving lives and reducing violence.
But the Trump administration last month abruptly terminated at least 373 public safety grants from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, pulling roughly $500 million in remaining funds across a range of programs, according to a new report by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonprofit think tank. The cuts come just as summer is approaching — a season when violence consistently peaks.
The grants were initially valued at $820 million, but many were multiyear awards at different stages of rollout, which means some of the money has already been spent.
At least 554 organizations across 48 states are affected by the cuts, many of them small, community-based nonprofits that rely on this money. The rescinded grants supported everything from violence prevention and policing to victim advocacy, reentry services, research, and mental health and substance use treatment. Some of the grants also were cut from state and local government agencies.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

Another new report from the Council on Criminal Justice dug deeper into local effects: It found that the Trump administration’s cuts also eliminated 473 minigrants — known as “subawards” — passed from primary recipients to smaller groups that often face challenges accessing federal dollars directly, such as rural government agencies and grassroots nonprofits.
About $5 million of those subawards was intended for state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies working to reduce violence in rural areas, according to the report.
Experts warn the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer months — historically linked to higher rates of violent crimes — are approaching, and the safety net in many cities is fraying. A growing body of research has found a correlation between spikes in temperature and violent crime, with studies suggesting that heat waves and sudden weather swings can inflame tensions and increase aggression.
“These programs are having to cut staff and cut services, and that will be felt in communities in states all over the country at exactly the time when they’re most needed,” said Amy Solomon, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and the lead author of the report.
Solomon also previously served as assistant U.S. attorney general in the Biden administration, where she led the Office of Justice Programs — the Justice Department’s largest grantmaking agency.
Many of the primary grants that were terminated contained no references to race, gender or diversity-related language, according to the report — despite claims from federal officials that such criteria were driving the cuts. Primary grant recipients received their funding from the feds directly.
‘Wasteful grants’
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the cuts in a late April post on X, stating that the department has cut “millions of dollars in wasteful grants.” She also signaled that additional cuts may be on the way. In her post, she specifically cited grants that supported LGBTQ+ liaison services in police departments and programs providing gender-affirming care and housing for incarcerated transgender people.
The Department of Justice’s cuts come amid a broader push by the Trump administration and the newly created Department of Government Efficiency to pull funding from a range of federal programs — a move they say is aimed at reducing spending and saving taxpayer dollars.
For some groups, the sudden withdrawal of funds has meant scaling back crime victim services or pulling out of some neighborhoods altogether.
Community violence prevention groups aim to stop shootings and other forms of violence before they happen by working directly with those most at risk. Staff — often with experience in the justice system — mediate conflicts, respond to crises, and connect people to support such as counseling or job training. In some cities, they’re dispatched to high-risk areas to deescalate tensions, often before police arrive.
And research shows that community-level violence prevention programs can contribute to drops in crime.
Most violent crime rates have fallen back to pre-pandemic levels, new report shows

After a historic surge in homicides in 2020, violent crime in the United States dropped in 2024 to pre-pandemic levels — or even lower — in many cities. Preliminary 2025 data suggests that the downward trend is continuing in major cities, including Baltimore, Houston, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
But the progress hasn’t reached every community. Some neighborhoods are still grappling with high rates of gun violence and car theft.
Organizations that faced the toughest financial cuts had been funded through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative — the federal government’s primary mechanism for supporting this work.
Since the program’s launch in 2022, the federal Office of Justice Programs has invested about $300 million in community violence intervention efforts and related research. But nearly half of that funding has now been wiped out, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
“It’s really unprecedented to see these kinds of grants cut midstream,” Solomon told Stateline. “This was an effort that had bipartisan support [in Congress] and in the field all across the country.”
Impact on communities nationwide
In late April, Aqeela Sherrills received a letter from the federal Justice Department terminating a $3.5 million grant that supported the Community-Based Public Safety Collective. Sherrills is the co-founder and executive director of the national organization, which focuses on community-led approaches to preventing violence, including mediating conflicts, building relationships in high-risk neighborhoods and connecting people to resources such as housing, mental health care and job training.
The letter said the organization’s efforts no longer aligned with the federal Justice Department’s priorities, which include supporting “certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.”
Until the end of April, the collective had an agreement with the Justice Department to provide training and technical assistance to 95 local groups — including community groups, police departments, city and county governments, and state agencies — that had each been awarded $2 million over three years to run community violence intervention programs.










We're bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.


– Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and CEO of the Community-Based Public Safety Collective


But after the department cut $3.5 million, the Community-Based Public Safety Collective was forced to lay off 20 staff members.
“Without the significant funding … it destabilizes the organizations. People’s ability to be able to provide for themselves and their family is at risk,” Sherrills said in an interview. “We’re bracing for what could potentially be a high-violence summer.”
The deepest funding cuts hit states led by both Republican and Democratic governors, including California, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
About $145 million in violence intervention funding was rescinded overall, along with an additional $8.6 million for related research and evaluation efforts, according to the Council on Criminal Justice report.
Some of the canceled grants funded studies and research on forensics, policing, corrections issues and behavioral health. Now, those projects may be left unfinished.
Some of the largest losses hit intermediary organizations, such as the Community-Based Public Safety Collective, that support smaller programs by providing microgrants, training and technical assistance.
Crime victims may get fewer services as federal aid drops. States weigh how to help.

For organizations such as the Newark Community Street Team in New Jersey, the loss of federal funding has left some areas of the city without coverage.
The funding had allowed staff to monitor neighborhoods and engage directly with community members to prevent violence. That included weekly community walks, where team members connected with victims of crime and people who may have witnessed violence, linking them to resources such as counseling or legal aid. The team also operates a hotline where residents can report crimes or alert staff to tensions that might escalate — allowing the team to step in before violence occurred.
Some of the lost funding also supported school-based initiatives, where mediators helped students resolve conflicts before they escalated into fights or other forms of violence.
Of the 15 Newark positions affected by the cuts, four employees were reassigned to other departments; the others were let go. Some of the team’s staff members are formerly incarcerated, a vital trait that helps them connect with residents and build trust in communities that are often wary of traditional law enforcement.
“We just have to continue working and serving our community the best we can,” said Rey Chavis, the executive director of the street team.
That work appears to be contributing to a decrease in the community’s crime rates.
City crime data from Jan. 1 to April 30, 2025, shows a significant drop in violent crime in Newark compared with the same period in 2024. The total number of violent crimes reported to police fell by 49%, driven largely by a 68% decrease in robberies, according to Stateline’s analysis of the data. Homicides dropped by 53%, while aggravated assaults declined by 43%. Rapes dropped slightly by 3%.

(Photo courtesy of 32BJ SEIU.)Charlotte Douglas International Airport employees took to the floor of the Charlotte City Council on Tuesday to allege unsafe working conditions, high turnover, and inadequate wages at the state’s largest airport.
The employees delivered hundreds of postcards from members of the 32BJ Service Employees International Union outlining labor concerns at the airport before addressing the council during its public comment session at 5 p.m. Speakers from the union urged city lawmakers to raise wages and pass stricter safety standards for the airport at the local level.
Dominique Chambers, a wheelchair agent at the airport, said working conditions directly interfere with his ability to assist elderly and disabled passengers.
“Every day, we are met with low wages, minimum benefits, and poor working conditions,” Chambers said. “The turnover rate is so high and we are so understaffed that many passengers are left waiting. Sometimes, we’re even pressured to push two passengers at the same time.”
Chambers said the cost of living in Charlotte has outpaced their wages to the point that colleagues of his are forced to stay with their families, live in their cars, or even remain unhoused altogether. Because he makes $12.50 an hour, Chambers said he has no choice but to live with his grandmother.
Donielle Prophete, the president of Communications Workers of America Local 3645, said that if councilors do not act on their concerns, then “now is the time for us to act and vote you off of this dais.” She asked the council to open a committee meeting to allow the union members to propose a new ordinance on workplace safety and higher wages.
“Charlotte Douglas is one of the largest economic engines in the city. If the workers who power it can’t count on their elected officials to protect them, then who can they count on?” Prophete said. “No Charlottean should be working full-time and still unable to afford rent, food, or health care.”
Later in the meeting, City Attorney Anthony Fox said the changes requested by the union are preempted by the state’s Wage and Hour Act, which largely reserves the right to set labor laws to the state legislature. He added that nothing the union has communicated to him about its proposal has changed that analysis.
“I understand the merits of what they’re asking for and it’s altruistic, it’s noble, but we are restricted by law on what we can do and how far we can go,” Fox said.
Councilor Victoria Watlington said it was her understanding that the union’s current proposal is not a direct modification to wage and labor standards, but rather, a change to the criteria the city uses to award contracts at the airport that would take into consideration those concerns — something she said is in the council’s purview.
Though three members of the council — Tiawana Brown, Reneé Johnson, and Watlington — requested a committee hearing on the issue, Mayor Vi Lyles declined to refer the issue, citing a need for further consultation with the city attorney.
Brown also requested that Lyles authorize the city council’s Budget, Government, and Intergovernment Relations Committee to investigate safety and efficiency at the airport. Lyles said she would discuss the matter with Fox’s office and make a determination based on his legal advice.
“These are things that I think about in a way that, how do we create jobs for people that pay better?” Lyles said. “How do we do that? That’s by getting behind people in a way that we can provide these opportunities for them.”
Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Lyles’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
In a press release, the union said the council has the power to pass their proposal, and that arguing preemption by state law is a “well-known tactic used by corporations and politicians to shut down common-sense measures that benefit workers and the public.”
“Dozens of cities across the country have passed similar legislation to raise airport standards — despite claims by some states that such local laws are preempted by state law,” said SEIU Southern Regional Director Chris Baumann. “It is disappointing that Mayor Lyles lacks the political will to do the same. Thousands of airport workers and their families won’t forget this failure come election time.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SEIU-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-29 05:00:33.266341

Ohio senators are considering a plan to require voters show proof of citizenship to register to vote. In a hearing this week, more than a dozen organizers and activists argued the bill’s stringent requirements would wind up disenfranchising eligible voters.
There is still no evidence of widespread voter fraud, despite Republicans warning for years about the threat posed by alleged noncitizen voters. In Ohio, for instance, the attorney general found six cases of illegal voting spread over twelve years.
Meanwhile, there is solid evidence that many Americans, more than 9% of voting-age citizens according to one study, don’t have up-to-date documents proving citizenship readily available. Name changes from marriage and/or divorce, and the availability of that documentation, complicates things further.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost announces six voter fraud indictments two weeks from Election Day

The bill and the pushback
Under Ohio Senate Bill 153, new voters and those updating their registration would have to prove their citizenship before being allowed to vote. In practice, most verifications would happen behind the scenes. Voters would provide their state driver’s license or ID number, and the BMV which typically has record of a person’s citizenship status, will give the board of elections a thumbs up or down.
But if for some reason the BMV can’t verify a voter’s status, they’d need to provide a valid birth certificate, U.S. passport, or naturalization document before casting a ballot. If they don’t, the voter would have to cast a provisional ballot and then provide proof after the fact.
SB 153 takes a skeptical view of those voters. Anyone who casts a provisional ballot and then doesn’t show up with the required documentation would have their registration cancelled.
Over and above the registration changes, the bill would eliminate ballot drop boxes and impose new requirements on petition circulators.
Some of that amounts to red tape — the canvasser would have to personally tally the number of signatures they collected rather than someone else in the campaign, for instance. Another change would require paid circulators to wear a badge identifying themselves as such.

Opponents of the bill emphasized the complications it will create for voters. All Voting is Local Action Senior Campaign Manager Greer Aeschbury argued the changes would lead to a dramatic increase in provisional voting. Her organization tracks provisional ballots, and found some 34,000 of them got rejected in the 2024 election.
“The second most popular reason for rejection was a lack of proper ID,” she explained. “This means that voters attempted to vote, but because of our strict photo ID rules, they either didn’t have the proper ID or simply forgot to bring it in.”
Under SB 153’s changes, Aeschbury said, those voters could show up at the next election, ID in hand because of that prior experience, only to learn their registration got canceled.
Scott Sibley recalled helping his 86-year-old grandfather get a state ID card when he was no longer able to drive. They gathered several documents including birth certificate and Social Security card, but couldn’t meet all five of the elements required by the state BMV.
It took a total of three visits, Sibley said, to get all the necessary documents.
“At the time government photo IDs were not yet a requirement for voting, but after this episode, I understood the arguments against such requirements,” he said. “Is this any way to treat an elderly World War II veteran? I cannot imagine that we would have made it through this new process under SB 153. I think we would have thrown up our hands.”
In addition to making registration more onerous for voters, Kelly Dufour, from Common Cause Ohio, explained the bill also puts new burdens on election officials already reeling from recent changes.
In the last two years, she said, more than “85 sections of related Revised Code have been amended, deleted or removed.” The current proposal would amend 46 more and add three new ones.
“It seems to me it’s a system that’s set up to fail,” she said. “So, I’m just asking to please slow down, maybe let the new laws simmer. Visit with election officials to get some of their input on meaningful improvements.”
She and others commented on election officials’ absence. While lawmakers were holding the hearing elections officials around Ohio were busy certifying the May 6 primary election.
Other voices weigh in
While many organizers criticized the bill’s aggressive approach to verifying registrations, several others argued it doesn’t go far enough.
Half a dozen people showed up to speak as an ‘interested party,’ warning poll workers aren’t adequately trained to verify citizenship documents, or that state officials should be even more proactive in reviewing the voters rolls.
Scott Taylor described himself as a poll worker from Montgomery County, and he zeroed in on the idea of a person providing proof of citizenship on Election Day.
“I got wondering, what would that certificate look like?” he told the committee.
Taylor said he went online, found an example and did a bit of editing. He held up the printout, framed with an ornate, official-looking border a bit like a dollar bill.
“So I generated my own certificate of citizenship, and I produced this in about 15 minutes,” Taylor said. “I went on to Google, and I found an example, and I just cut it up a bit, put a picture of a cat on it.”
He argued that it’s unfair to ask poll workers to distinguish a real document from a fake, so he said that any voter who hasn’t proven their citizenship prior to Election Day should be forced to cast a provisional ballot.
Gail Niederlehner from Butler County insisted that in several ways the bill “closed the front door” only to “leave the back door open.” She said that voters shouldn’t even be allowed to register without providing proof of citizenship.
“Without pre-registration verification, the risk of noncitizen registration continues,” she said.
Niederlehner criticized the bill for accepting expired documents like a passport as proof of citizenship and said the proposal’s regular reviews of the voters aren’t stringent enough.
To this point there has still been just one entity to voice support for the measure.
FGA Action, which previously went by Opportunity Solutions Project, is a Florida-based think tank that advocates for conservative policies in statehouses around the country. It gets some of its funding from the conservative dark money network controlled by former Federalist Society president Leonard Leo, and it backed the effort by Republican lawmakers in 2023 to make it harder to amend the Ohio Constitution.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Ohio Senate leadership has given public school districts some hope that their version of the state budget will provide better financial support for education.
Cleveland Heights/University Heights City School District (CHUH) prioritizes musical expression for its students.
“I’m part of band, and we go on trips and we play music, we perform,” CHUH freshman Kennedi Brown said. “We also do a lot of fundraisers, and it’s really fun.”
For the flutist, she has been waiting for a trip for musicians to go to New York.
“We do master classes, which actually enhance our playing and it makes us better players,” she said.
Brown, Emmanuel Gutierrez, and a group of students and educators came to Columbus to represent the school, testifying before the Ohio Senate Education Committee about the importance of education funding.
The district would have received $7 million from the state under the expected full phase-in of Ohio’s Fair School Funding formula. But under cuts in the Ohio House version of the education budget, they would only receive $700,000.
Asked if they fear that trip won’t happen if school funding is cut, Brown responded, “Absolutely.”
She said she worries the state will squeeze school budgeting even more, through a House proposal to cap districts’ rainy day funds to 30% — and refunding anything above that back to the taxpayer.
The Senate Finance Committee is currently reviewing hundreds of amendments to the House’s passed budget, and although the chamber’s budget isn’t out yet, Senate leadership has already said that the 30% cap isn’t enough.
“I, personally, think 30% is too low if we were to do a carryover balance cap,” Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said.
A week later, he added that the caucus would “definitely” need to have a conversation as to “whether we want to have a cap at all.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, who helped come up with the idea, defended the cap.
“Schools are just sitting on a lot more money than they can spend,” Huffman claimed.
According to the House GOP, schools have carried over $10.5 billion, which should be going back to the residents. The bill would require counties to cut property tax rates, distributing unspent cash back.
“The extra money that you have, that you didn’t need to spend and you don’t need to start your year — while your other taxes are coming in — we’re going to reduce the real estate taxes in that school district on a pro rata basis,” the speaker said.
School district treasurers and county auditors have warned that the plan to cap reserves would cause major problems. They say it would throw the most basic aspects of money management for schools into complete disarray, punish districts for being good stewards of public funds, and make financial planning, saving for projects, and managing risk all much more difficult.
The Cleveland Heights students hope that the Senate will follow through on public education funding.
“Losing school funding could cut down on all of our stuff in the orchestra and everything in our school,” Gutierrez said.
The substitute bill is expected to be announced in early June.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio Statehouse Republican leaders have appointed a financial tech executive to the retired teachers’ pension fund ahead of the vote for a new executive director.
Lynn Beal has been appointed to STRS Ohio by House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, and Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon.
Beal is the vice president and head of implementation and customer success at Upstart, an AI platform that “partners with banks and credit unions to provide consumer loans,” according to her LinkedIn profile.
Having previously working at JP Morgan, she specializes in data science, analytics and insights.
Askedwhy he chose Beal, McColley said she presents what he wants to see in a board member.
“When we look into an awful lot of what’s happening with any board, really, not just the pension boards, it’s important for us to understand what’s going on because oftentimes we’re the insurer of last resort,” McColley said. “We’ve got to know what’s going on with all of this stuff, to understand the decisions that the board is making, and frankly, as I pointed out before, it’s not easy to find people who want to do this, and so we’re thankful that people are willing to step up.”
This position has remained vacant since Claudia Herrington finished her term in the winter.
The decision comes at a time when lawmakers are going back and forth with STRS board members. In emails obtained by News 5, McColley, Huffman, Gov. Mike DeWine and Treasurer Robert Sprague asked the board not to move forward yet on a new director.
“We respectfully request that the Board hold on scheduling the vote for the new executive director until the June 11-13, 2025 meetings,” the leaders said in a joint letter on May 8. “This will ensure that the legislative leaders can make their appointment and that individuals can have time to become acclimated before further leadership decisions are made.”
This comes after a year of controversy in which elected educators are accused of participating in a $65 billion corruption scheme. The board chair denies all allegations, and some retired educators are accusing the Statehouse Republicans of trying to stop transparency.
The board did not select an executive director during its last meeting, but it may make a decision in its upcoming meeting in June. The finalists are Steven Toole, former head of the North Carolina Retirement Systems and Greg Samoryski, the head of Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System.

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)As a Kansas public school teacher and parent, I am deeply concerned about ongoing attacks on public education, most recently through executive actions by the Trump administration that include eliminating the Department of Education and targeting the free speech of students.
Halting federal support for our schools and students will ensure historically marginalized students do not receive equal opportunities, will take away resources such as student lunches and special education programming, and will stifle learning communities. Despite these attacks, educators and communities are showing fight and resilience that is cause for hope.
Some leaders in Washington are pushing the Educational Choice for Children Act. If enacted nationwide, ECCA would divert billions of taxpayer dollars from our public schools to subsidize private institutions. In fact, similar bills were proposed locally in the Kansas Legislature, and recently, a coalition of organizations, including Game On for Kansas Schools, Showing Up for Racial Justice Education Core, Voter Rights Network of Wyandotte County, among many others, educated the public about the dangers of these with multiple screenings of the documentary “Backpack Full of Cash.”
The Kansas Legislature recently passed a budget that cruelly underfunds special education, but due to the work of pro-public education groups, the voucher bill did not come up for a vote this session. Voucher programs only worsen ongoing budget cuts to public school children, benefiting a privileged few while leaving low-income and rural students with fewer resources.
Most recently, the Trump administration issued an executive order on school discipline, implying that school discipline had gotten worse as a result of the policies of Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. In fact, the school-to-prison pipeline, or the more nuanced school and prison nexus, which is caused by disproportionate policing and punishment leveled on Black and brown students, is a crisis that Trump’s executive order will only exacerbate.
While it is true that serious improvements need to be made in terms of how our system relates to educators, school staff, students and communities to improve schools for all, it is also true that investments in prisons and police have exceeded holistic investments in educating our young people. In fact, policing is nearly the greatest expenditure for school districts nationally. With Trump reversing the nominal pressure of past Democratic administrations on this crisis, we can expect even greater pressure on schools and teachers to increasingly criminalize marginalized students.
Unfortunately, attacks on students, teachers, and communities do not stop with voucher bills and executive actions. Distressingly, there is bipartisan support at both the Kansas and national levels for punishing speech, especially in schools and against students who support Palestine or are simply critical of Israel.
It is also widely documented that immigrant students are struggling to learn along with their peers under increasing criminalization by the Trump administration. In fact, parents are reporting to school staff that they are afraid to bring their kids to schools because of widespread ICE raids ordered by this administration.
Resources for educators have popped up to help support immigrant students who are under attack. Families are also fighting back. In February, A Day Without Immigrants showed massive resistance to anti-immigrant attitudes and policies.
Furthermore, the GOP attacks on transgender students, and LGBTQ+ students more broadly, has reached a fever pitch and are being used to drive a wedge between Kansans who would otherwise stand for public education access for all children. Republicans voted to override Democratic Gov. Laura’s Kelly veto and target some of the state’s most vulnerable children. According to advocacy organization Loud Light: Legislators “expanded their targeting of LGBTQ kids by providing legal protections to potential foster or adoptive parents with anti-LGBTQ beliefs, no matter how extreme.”
Public education is the foundation of a multiracial democracy. If we are serious about ensuring quality education for all students — not just the wealthiest — we must reject efforts to defund public schools and criminalize our youth.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Earlier this month, over a thousand of the brightest young minds on our planet converged on Columbus, Ohio, for the International Science Fair.
It was a special moment for me because I competed at the event as a high school senior, and that experience played a role in launching my physics career. To give back in some way, I volunteered to be a judge.
Competitions like these are about the students. It prepares them to find their place in the vast and astoundingly successful landscape of American science, which is the envy of the world.
It’s no coincidence that the international competition, which could be held anywhere on the planet, is held year after year in the United States.
It’s also not a coincidence that it was held in Ohio. The organizers of the fair understood that Ohio is a scientific powerhouse, home to many thousands of scientists and engineers who meet the strict criteria to be judges.
For similar reasons, when I competed, the location was in silicon valley.
If you are one of the many scientists and engineers in Ohio, then you are probably aware that in mid-April DOGE arrived at science funding agencies like the National Science Foundation. You are also aware that it isn’t just the DEI, education, or climate-related grants now getting the axe.
Science agencies face up to 55% cuts across the board, reductions of tens of billions of dollars. But even before Congress can vote on these cuts, DOGE is already in the process of laying off staff at the National Science Foundation, just like they did at USAID and the US Department of Education.
These staff have masters or Ph.Ds in the fields of the grant programs being cut, precisely who you would want to oversee the investment of taxpayer dollars in scientific research.
All of this was on my mind as I interviewed students about their projects. I met students who had discovered new exoplanets using NASA data and artificial intelligence algorithms.
I talked to students who took over their parents’ garage to test theories about light, fluids, or sound. As I interviewed these students, I wondered if they would get the same chances that I did to succeed.
When I was in college, I twice received National Science Foundation support to do summer astronomy research. Now, in summer 2025, the number of spots for federally funded undergrad research programs have been drastically reduced.
After college, I was fortunate to become a Ph.D. student at Ohio State. This year, anticipating the loss of federal dollars, Ohio State reduced their graduate admissions and some universities have even rescinded offers. If I were a student now, my career could easily be derailed by these roadblocks.
As a society, we have an obligation to give our kids the same opportunities to succeed that earlier generations had. Our students and postdocs should be on the ground floor of scientific discoveries with data from world-class instruments.
Instead, it seems, they will be on the ground floor of nothing, and unable to build the professional relationships that grow into a cutting-edge career.

(Photo by Nada Hassanein/Stateline)COLUMBIA, S.C. — It’s as if she’s squinting through a smoke-filled room. But it’s Charisse Brown’s eye condition, glaucoma, that diminishes her vision.
Brown, 38, has worked all her adult life, with a personal policy of keeping two jobs at once. But when she started losing sight in her left eye last year, she was forced to quit her call center job. That left her with one income stream, her marketing research job, to pay her $1,300 monthly rent and other bills.
If glaucoma is caught early, monitored by a doctor and properly treated, it’s possible to stall the progression of the disease. Eye drops are necessary for keeping eye pressure down to slow glaucoma-induced damage. Without insurance, the monthly cost of the medication can run anywhere from $80 per bottle for a generic version to $200 or $300 for a brand-name one.
As an adult without children, Brown doesn’t qualify for Medicaid in South Carolina, which has not expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act. 
She’s enrolled in the lowest-premium plan on her state’s health care insurance marketplace, but ophthalmologists in the area won’t accept her insurance.
She said she called 211, a hotline for community services in South Carolina, but her voicemails weren’t returned. In medical debt and about to get kicked out of her apartment, she had to choose between her medication and paying for daily necessities like food and feminine care items. One food stamps enrollment worker told her: “We can’t approve you. If you go and have a baby, this will be a lot easier.”
“Single people — we’re struggling,” Brown said. “I feel like I’m getting punished for trying to do what’s right.”
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause a buildup of pressure that damages the optic nerve. Long called the “thief of sight,” it’s the leading cause of blindness in Black Americans like Brown. Black people are five times more likely to have glaucoma, and lose their sight at six times the rate of white people. Hispanic and Latino communities suffer similar disparities.
Among Black patients, a timely diagnosis is paramount: Glaucoma occurs on average a decade earlier — and advances faster.
But diagnosis and treatment can be costly and out of reach for many.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

In South Carolina and the other nine states that have not expanded Medicaid, opponents of expansion say it would be too expensive to provide health coverage to more people, even though the federal government picks up 90% of the tab. But forgoing expansion also has costs. People without insurance or not enough insurance are more likely to visit the emergency room, as glaucoma and other chronic diseases take their toll. When it comes to eye diseases, vision can deteriorate without coverage for preventive care. And racial health disparities are higher in states that have not expanded.
“You see a lot of end-stage disease,” said Dr. Rebecca Epstein, a glaucoma specialist and ophthalmologist at South Carolina’s Clemson Eye, which was not involved in Brown’s care. “They don’t have insurance, and so they will delay care. And then they come in, one eye is already gone, another eye is on its way — and I’m sitting here having to tell them I’ve got to operate on their only eye.”
For about two months, Brown was fully blind in her left eye. Surgeries to address her warping cornea, a condition called keratoconus, and another to relieve pressure causing her glaucoma would cost upward of $10,000. Asked if they could offer a payment plan, her doctor’s office staff said no.
For days, Brown and her siblings called dozens of charities, asking for help to pay for her surgery. They called doctors across the state, asking if they had the necessary surgeon specialists and whether they accepted her insurance. Some nonprofits told Brown she was too young, that their help was reserved for older adults.
She finally landed on the South Carolina charity Lions Vision Services, affiliated with Lions Club International. The group offers eyeglasses, vision screenings and reimbursements to local doctors for surgeries patients living below the poverty line can’t afford. The charity told her it could pay for her eye surgeries, and Brown was in disbelief.










You don't give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you're going to pay for their disability when they go blind?


– Dr. Rebecca Epstein, ophthalmologist at Clemson Eye


“Access shouldn’t be this hard. Our state should do a better job of making sure that we have coverage for people and that they have access to care — before they’re blind,” Epstein said. “Here’s the crazy thing to think about: So, you don’t give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you’re going to pay for their disability when they go blind, right? How backwards is that?”
Had she not gotten the surgeries, Brown would have lost sight completely in that left eye, doctors told her.
Before she found Lions, the search had been so frustrating that she told her mother through tears, “Maybe I should just let this eye go.”
 ‘Shoulder that burden’

Since Brown could no longer drive, she’d take Uber rides across town for her frequent appointments. For appointments in Charleston with her surgeon, her mother would drive from Myrtle Beach to Columbia, 2 1/2 hours away, for another two-hour drive to Charleston. After one surgery, she developed an infection and had to visit her Columbia doctor daily — $30 roundtrip — because her case was so critical. Knowing she couldn’t afford the appointments, her doctor stopped charging her at follow-ups.
Servants for Sight, a faith-based nonprofit that helps South Carolinians in poverty pay for vision care, offers to pay for surgeries, treatments and Uber rides to eye care appointments. Rideshares have helped people “not only start their care, but complete their care,” said Amy Evette, executive director of Servants for Sight.
The group also runs a mobile vision screening unit that visits communities across northwestern South Carolina. Volunteers and staff screen for signs of diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy inside the white-and-green van, and connect patients to ophthalmologists for further care. The van is equipped with retinal imaging equipment and rows of free sunglasses. On the outside are logos of various eye care centers and nonprofits who volunteer to help.

“If people don’t have insurance or are not able to afford an eye exam once a year, it’s very difficult for them to detect any kind of eye disease,” said Sandra Torres, an ophthalmic technician of 17 years. The group works with homeless shelters, and she says many people end up on the streets because they lose their sight, and then their jobs.
The vehicle saw a busy recent Thursday morning in Spartanburg, a city of about 38,000 people roughly 30 miles southeast of Greenville. Stationed in the parking lot behind a free medical clinic, staff prepared for nearly three dozen patients scheduled that day.
Multiple residents filed into the van throughout the morning, many with thick contact casts wrapped around their calves and feet, used to heal and protect diabetic ulcers. Diabetes, which increases the risk of glaucoma, disproportionately affects people with lower incomes and communities of color, amid structural barriers to affordable health care and healthier food.

Angela Garrett, a local pastor, has been grappling with blurred vision and diabetes. Uninsured, she came to the unit to get her eye pressure and vision checked. Garrett, 55, is also recovering from a recent open-heart surgery. A caregiver for older adults, she said she’ll apply for Medicaid as soon as she’s recovered and can go back to work. In South Carolina, the income limit for a single person who is blind or living with a disability is $15,650.
She’s passionate about caregiving, a pursuit “from the heart,” even though her job is “the bottom of pay in medical,” she said. Despite her modest income, she may not qualify for Medicaid.
Often, patients don’t know help is available, or they stop coming to their appointments because they can’t drive and lack transportation, or they’re unable to pay, said Dr. Peter Daniel, another ophthalmologist and glaucoma specialist who works with the nonprofits. He recalled a glaucoma patient who stopped showing up for appointments. The man began to weep when Daniel told him not to worry about the cost and connected him with the charities.
“They’re in very difficult socioeconomic and complex situations,” Daniel said. “And those are the folks that I worry about going blind.”
Columbia optometrist Dr. Kendria Cartledge sees late-diagnosed glaucoma “daily.” She said the majority of her patients are on Medicaid, and that not enough eye care providers accept the public insurance program, putting more pressure on the ones who do.

The state Medicaid eligibility redetermination process has complicated matters. Patients may have had Medicaid in the past and are still struggling financially, but as states cull the rolls, they may lose coverage without knowing it. With glaucoma patients and others at risk of losing vision, timely care gets interrupted.
“A lot of these patients are getting lost to follow-up,” said Cartledge, who has been treating whole families with the disease among multiple siblings for years, building a relationship with them. “Some expansion would definitely help out these patients have better outcomes, have a better quality of life.”
The gigantic tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week could make that situation worse. The measure would cut federal Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years, largely by enacting new work rules and additional paperwork requirements. The changes would remove about 7.6 million people from the Medicaid rolls over the next decade, according to initial estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
Ophthalmologists like Daniel give care knowing they’re losing money, even after partial reimbursement from charities.
“If a charity can carry that burden, why can’t our state and federal systems help shoulder that burden? We do it for older patients, we do it for our Medicare population,” said Epstein, the Clemson Eye ophthalmologist. “Why can’t we do it for our younger patients?”
 When ‘all else fails’

Clad in a bright yellow tunic and woven sun hat, Jekeithlyn Ross stopped by the Servants for Sight check-in table to introduce herself. Only she didn’t have to. Marion Keller already knew Ross was the daughter of eye disease advocate J.C. Stroble as soon as she spoke her dad’s name. Keller has a bobblehead figurine of Stroble in her curio cabinet.

Ross has been on a mission to relaunch her nonprofit, the J.C. Stroble Glaucoma Awareness Foundation. Dormant during COVID-19, the organization is named for her late dad, who had glaucoma and was blind. The eye care advocate and Spartanburg icon died in 2013 at 71.
“Trying to get services to those that are falling between the cracks or the socioeconomically challenged is a challenge,” Ross said. “What we’re trying to do is go to the people, try to get the services to decrease the rate of blindness here.”
A volunteer with the South Carolina Lions Club and speaker at churches and national and local civic events, Stroble was also well-known in the community for his boisterous order-calling at the local fast-food fixture, the Beacon Drive-In. The eatery, where he was nicknamed the “Beacon Barker,” is popular among locals and as a stop on campaign trails. Inside, Stroble’s portrait adorns the wall chronicling the diner’s storied history, which includes presidential candidate visits, along with benchmarks like the launch of the internet.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

At the Servants for Sight check-in table, the excitement was palpable: Ross and Keller talked about their mirrored missions as if they were old friends. Keller shared that she had a cornea transplant, and before they parted ways, she and Ross blew each other a kiss. “This is a marriage. This is only the beginning,” Ross said.
Ross said she was aware of glaucoma because of her dad, but others without exposure might not know the importance of getting their eyes checked, or even that it runs in their families.
“We’re back in action — because the need is great,” Ross said. “Education, awareness is the key. It’s essential, and it’s not enough foot soldiers out there putting that message out.”
She’s been going to churches, civic groups, clinics and mobile units to spread the word about the foundation.
“Nonprofits pick up the pieces. We have a little joke: ‘When the government and all else fails, then you come to us,’” she said with a wry chuckle. “Because what do you do? You help.”
 ‘Like looking through a plastic sandwich bag’

Servants for Sight helped pay for glaucoma surgery and eye drops for 71-year-old Jimmie “Coach Sheek” Robinson. The retired school bus driver and Little League coach said he’s had trouble accessing Medicare.

“It was like looking through a plastic sandwich bag,” he recalled. “I’m asking, ‘Lord, what is happening to my eyes?’”
Often running in families, glaucoma can sneak up in those with 20/20 vision all their life, like Robinson.
He couldn’t see his fellow churchgoers’ hands, extended to greet him with a handshake. He’d have to explain that his peripheral vision was waning.
Handshakes matter at Piney Grove Baptist, a small congregation with scarlet carpets in Anderson, about 30 miles southwest of Greenville. A “flimsy grip won’t do it,” said one deaconess at the podium on a recent Sunday. “You can tell someone loves you,” she said, by their handshake.
“Shake my hand,” she exclaimed as parishioners laughed. “Show up with love.”
That day, Robinson, donning glasses, was able to do that. Throughout the sermon, he’d wave his hand in prayer over his daughter and grandchildren, who filled the pew behind him.
“I’m not going to get depressed over my eye,” he said. “God been good to me.”
Back in Columbia, with those costly prescriptions, doctor and rideshare visit costs adding up, Charisse Brown said she is now steeped in about $7,500 in debt, with Uber costs totaling $1,500 alone. She’s kept a GoFundMe up to try to chip away at bills through donations.

She has just moved into another apartment, a gray-floored two-bedroom, where rent is $300 cheaper than her previous one-bedroom flat. Leaving lights on at night, along with the beaming lamppost right outside her back door, helps her navigate her apartment after dark.
“That’s pretty much the only way that I am able to see, is enough light is coming in, especially in my left eye,” she said.
Brown said her friends have noticed her own light dimming.
Friends have always called her “Kumbaya” for her outgoing and positive attitude. But after her vision crisis, she fell into despair. She stopped going out, self-conscious about the appearance of her left eye, which is sometimes swollen and has strabismus. Because she can’t hop in her car for a spontaneous road trip like she used to, she’s leaned on her personal avatar in the online game “Second Life,” where she simulates going to the beach and streams her pastor’s sermons, as if she’s sitting in the pews.
She’s trying to lift her spirits by writing poetry and tending to her plants. In the corner of her sparsely furnished living room sits a fern she’s named Duchess, a pothos called Prince and a few other small pots, studded with budding succulents.
Sitting on the couch, she reads from her poem “Overcome.” She’d been lying in the hospital bed after a surgery, using speech-to-text to write:
Darkness and light both dwell in the same universe, but light always outshines – so I nicknamed myself ‘Bright,’
To be able to blind the Dark from coming my way.
It’s so blinding that maybe he would give up
And leave me alone today.

A judge may decide if that's legal.","The decades-long wars among the kingdoms of medieval Europe have their political equivalents in California’s decades-long political conflicts among economic and cultural interest groups.
Governors and legislators come and go with election cycles, but warriors employed by the countless interest groups are permanent fixtures in the Capitol and in other political arenas, such as regulatory agencies, ballot measure elections and the courts.
Farmers vs. environmentalists clash over water allocations, employers vs. unions over wages and benefits, insurers vs. personal injury lawyers over liability, and hospitals vs. nurses over staffing requirements. They’re just a few of many perpetual skirmishes, often with multi-billion-dollar stakes.
One of the more interesting — and most important, from the standpoint of its effect on children — is the never-ending war between the public education establishment and the charter school movement.
Simply put, charter school advocates contend that by doing away with many of the legal and regulatory mandates on conventional public schools, they can provide more effective instruction. But school boards, administrators and teachers’ unions see charters as parasitic competitors for students and attendance-based school money.
While charters have a legal right to exist and claim shares of school financing and sometimes occupy classrooms in public school sites, their rivals — particularly politically powerful unions — do what they can to limit charter expansion or even put existing charters out of business.
Last year, for instance, the California School Boards Association mounted a campaign to make it easier for local boards to reject applications for new charters. The legislation, Senate Bill 1380, made it to the Senate floor but garnered just 13 votes, way short of the 21 required.
Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second largest public school system with more than a half-million students, has been one of the most volatile arenas for the charter school battle. Control of its board — whose members are full-time officeholders — periodically shifts back and forth between those allied with United Teachers Los Angeles and other unions, and those who aren’t.
LAUSD, like California’s other urban districts, has been experiencing declining enrollment, which translates into declining amounts of state school aid that’s based primarily on attendance, thereby increasing the intensity of hostilities over money that the charters claim.
Last year, after union-backed candidates achieved a majority on the LAUSD board, it issued a new policy declaring that the district should “avoid” housing charters in 346 of the district’s school sites, thereby potentially evicting them.
The Charter School Association sued, contending that the policy violated state law that allows such co-housing arrangements, including a 2000 ballot measure, Proposition 39. That measure, which was mostly aimed at lowering the vote requirement for local school bond issues, also, as one analysis puts it, “requires each local K-12 school district to provide charter school facilities sufficient to accommodate the charter school’s students.”
The suit is now before Superior Court Judge Stephen Goorvitch, and the outcome seems to hinge on the disputed policy’s use of the word “avoid.” In his tentative ruling, Goorvitch wrote that “avoid” could be considered the same as “prohibit,” which then could render the policy illegal. The district’s attorney argued that “avoid” was not prohibitive but merely guidance.
The judge suggested the two sides discuss a compromise. But in the absence of a deal, Goorvitch told the lawyers that if he sides with the charters, the school board could counter by changing the disputed word to something less prescriptive. “I think this can be fixed,” Goorvitch said. “This may end up being a narrow and temporary victory for the petitioner.”
In other words, regardless of the suit’s outcome, it will be just another skirmish in a perpetual war.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051122_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-29 03:01:57.184273

Thomas Barwick/Getty ImagesIn Georgia, 1 in 10 adults or 2 in 5 children rely on Medicaid for their health care coverage, over 70% of which is federally funded. While Georgia already has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country with 1.2 million of our fellow Georgians living without critical coverage, lawmakers in Congress are right now weighing legislation that includes major changes to Medicaid which would reduce federal investment in the program by an estimated $625 billion. Not only would such reforms increase our already high uninsured rate and threaten Georgians’ access to care, but they would also deeply harm our local economies and state, putting pressure on the state budget.
Everyday Georgians, including those who don’t receive their health care from the program, will ultimately be the ones shouldering the economic burdens caused by federal Medicaid cuts. Depending on the specific type of cut Congress ultimately enacts, Georgia could lose nearly 17,000 jobs, including nearly nine thousand healthcare jobs in 2026 alone. Georgia also potentially stands to lose $578 million in federal Medicaid funding, putting enormous pressure on our state budget, and forcing our state officials to make difficult choices about which programs will continue to get funding, potentially reversing the strides Georgia has made in addressing issues like maternal and infant mortality and mental health.
If Congress were to move forward with the House-passed legislation, it’s estimated that between 72,000 and 120,000 Georgians could lose Medicaid coverage. And, we know that when more uninsured Georgians show up to hospitals needing medical attention, rates of uncompensated care increase. More uninsured Georgians means that we all will pay more for our health insurance, as premiums will go up when hospitals raise their prices to shift the cost of uncompensated care to those who can pay. These higher premiums also impact Georgia’s employers, especially our small business owners, who may have to make the tough choice between cutting employee benefits, reducing wages, or risking financial strain. Property taxes would also likely increase, because local governments rely on them to sustain struggling community hospitals.
Included in the House bill is a framework requiring states to implement work requirements for certain groups of Medicaid enrollees, a method Georgia has piloted for the past two years in Georgia Pathways, Georgia’s partial Medicaid expansion program, which launched in 2023. With its low enrollment numbers and high administrative costs, Pathways has proven that work requirements are burdensome to the state, the taxpayer, and the enrollee. In Georgia’s 2025 renewal application for the Pathways program, the state has requested to decrease the frequency of work reporting requirements because of the administrative burden. Congress right now is proposing to add reporting requirements for Medicaid programs nationally, which goes against everything we’ve learned in Georgia.
The impacts of proposed federal reforms to Medicaid would be felt most acutely by our state’s most vulnerable communities. Folks living in rural areas are more likely to be served by Medicaid, and cuts to the program will threaten an essential revenue stream for our rural hospitals, who often rely more heavily on Medicaid reimbursement. Nine rural Georgia hospitals have closed since 2010, and as many as 18 more are now struggling and in danger of closing or dramatically reducing services. Cutting Medicaid may push many of those over the line. Such closures have ripple effects — local businesses will suffer or be forced to relocate when rural hospitals close, leaving thousands of community members without jobs and access to healthcare.
As a proud lifelong Republican and former County Commissioner for Habersham County, I have spent decades pushing for fiscally responsible solutions for our state. Cuts to Medicaid are not only fiscally irresponsible, but they could threaten the livelihoods of our fellow Georgians and the economic opportunities that consistently make our great state a top state for business.
Unfortunately, there are many influential voices who use divisive rhetoric, misinformation, and fear mongering to cloud the understanding of what the Medicaid program is delivering for our state, and who really benefits from this safety net. Chances are, you know someone who could lose access to their local hospital, their job, or their healthcare coverage as a result of the proposed Medicaid changes. It might surprise you to learn that I used Medicaid insurance as a young mother, which enabled me to have my first child and take care of my family without going into medical debt — or worse. Without it, I likely would not have been able to become a successful FinTech professional and small business owner, or fulfill my call to public service. Medicaid covers 40% of all babies and kids in our state, thousands of seniors in nursing homes and people receiving long-term care, and many hardworking adults like me. Buying into misinformation will lead to policy decisions that hurt our neighbors and our state economy.
While Congress is considering harmful cuts, it’s essential everyday Georgians be heard. If enough Georgians speak up for the health of our neighbors and our economy, together, a symphony of voices can rise above the noise. Call your representatives — let them know about the negative impacts that Medicaid cuts would have on Georgians like you and me. Remind them that work reporting requirements add costly red tape without improving accountability. Urge your friends, family members, and neighbors to do the same. A vote to cut Medicaid is a vote against the health — and the economic prosperity — of our state and Georgian families.

Parren Mitchell, a trailblazer in many respects who was the first African American elected to Congress from Maryland.","The Parren J. Mitchell memorial outside the Pip Moyer Recreation Center in Annapolis. (Photo courtesy of the City of Annapolis)Keiffer Mitchell Jr. remembers that his uncle, the late Rep. Parren J. Mitchell, would always arrive a bit late for November and Christmas dinners.
“We would say, ‘Uncle Parren, where you were? How come you were late?’” the younger Mitchell said in an interview Wednesday. “He sat and had dinner with the men and women in the penitentiary. He represented his people.”
It was just one of the memories shared Wednesday at the dedication of a memorial honoring Parren Mitchell, the first African American member of Congress from Maryland as well as a pioneer in other areas.
A few hundred friends, family members and dignitaries braved the rain to honor Mitchell during the dedication of the black stone memorial at the Pip Moyer Recreation Center in Annapolis, featuring images and words from the late congressman’s life.
Wednesday was the anniversary of Mitchell’s death in 2007 at age 85, He made history as the first Black member of Congress from Maryland, but Mitchell was making a name for himself well before his election to the House in 1970.
Born and raised in Baltimore, he joined the Army in 1942 and was assigned to the all-Black 92nd Infantry Division. He served in Italy, earning a Purple Heart, and on his return used his GI Bill money to earn a bachelor’s degree from what was then Morgan State College. He then successfully sued for the right to attend the University of Maryland, College Park, becoming the first Black graduate student on the campus and earning a master’s in sociology.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He was elected to Congress in 1970 from Maryland’s 7th District and served eight terms before stepping down in 1987. He was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a fierce advocate for policies protecting small- and minority-owned businesses. When then-President Jimmy Carter signed the Small Business Act and Small Business Investment Act in 1978, the legislation included amendments from Mitchell to fund and support minority businesses.
When Sen. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s) and Del. H. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County) sponsored proposals in the 2024 legislature requiring state agencies to set aside 10% of contracts for minority- and veteran-owned businesses, they named it for Mitchell. Their bill ultimately passed and was signed into law.
“Congressman Parren Mitchell did so much that, even in his death, that his legacy still lives on,” said Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), chair of the Legislative Black Caucus. “Our Maryland Black Caucus will continue to make sure that his legacy and his work and his leadership lives in all of the work that we do.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) credited Mitchell’s trailblazing with making it possible for him to be governor today.
“I want to be very, very clear: I am not the 63rd governor of the state of Maryland had it not been for Congressman Parren Mitchell,” Moore said at Wednesday[s event.
Moore also read a citation which he gave to the Mitchell family.

“What you see here is you see an entire mosaic of our state in celebration. Today is not just a great day for Anne Arundel County. Today is a great day for the state of Maryland and a great day for the United States of America,” Moore said to a warm applause.
Moore, who attended the 90-minute ceremony with his wife, received a standing ovation when he walked to the microphone to speak on the importance of Mitchell’s legacy.
Not everyone was as welcoming of Moore, who this month vetoed a bill that would have created a Maryland Reparations Commission.
“We need that reparations bill. We need it,” Greg Thrasher shouted toward Moore. Thrasher, who recently moved to Anne Arundel County from Michigan, said he is not part of a local Black Lives Matter group, but after elected officials and others were acknowledged, he yelled, “Black Lives Matters is here, too.”
But most of the afternoon’s proceedings were celebratory. The Caucus of African American Leaders and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Committee led efforts that helped raise $100,000 for the memorial in just four months.
Although Mitchell was a Baltimore City native, the memorial in Annapolis has a Mitchell connection: His nephew, former state Sen. Michael Mitchell, was arrested during a sit-in at a segregated restaurant in Annapolis and called Moyer, a former mayor, to post his bail, according to an article in Eye on Annapolis.
Parren Mitchell’s niece, Lisa Mitchell Sennaar, thanked everyone and mentioned her uncle didn’t have any children.
“I see the legacy of Karen Mitchell in this room. We are His children. We are his legacy,” said Mitchell Sennaar, a small business reserve compliance manager in the Governor’s Office of Small, Minority and Women Business Affairs.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Parren-J.-Mitchell-Memorial-5-28-2025-1024x610.jpg,,,2025-05-29 04:00:38.583565

(Photo by Danielle Brown/Maryland Matters)Lawmakers and Baltimore City officials announced a new unit within the Baltimore City Sheriff’s Office Wednesday to crack down on “nuisance” liquor stores and other venues where liquor is sold.
“We know the enforcement around liquor license establishments is something that has been a challenge for the city,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Wednesday at the Baltimore City Board of Liquor License Commissioners’ office. “It’s not really about reducing crime, but deterring crime before it happens.”
Under a law approved in the 2025 legislative session, the Office of the Sheriff of Baltimore City will create the Neighborhood Services Unit to collaborate with liquor license officials to better enforce liquor laws throughout the city, specifically in high-traffic areas and entertainment districts such as Federal Hill and Fells Point.
“This is a commitment to strengthening our neighborhoods, enhancing public safety and holding accountable those who disregard our liquor laws and contribute to disorder in our community,” Ferguson said. “This unit will focus on targeted enforcement during peak hours and in high-traffic areas.”

Del. Stephanie Smith (D-Baltimore City), who sponsored House Bill 1293 to formally establish that collaboration, said that the presence of liquor stores can bring unanticipated “woes” into neighborhoods and communities such as increased litter, unlawful actions and reckless behavior.
“Businesses can be partners, and they can be great neighbors, but this is about ensuring that they’re not nuisances,” Smith said.
There is already collaboration between the sheriff’s office and the Board of License Commissioners for Baltimore City, according to Sen. Mary Washington (D-Baltimore City), the chair of the city delegation in the Senate.
But the new law,which takes effect Oct. 1,  will let the Board of License Commissioners enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Neighborhood Services Unit to better facilitate enforcement of Baltimore’s liquor laws, and make sure “the Liquor Board and the sheriff’s office are working together hand-in-hand,” Washington said.
“They actually do work together, but this is actually providing a structure — where they do it, where there’s clear roles, shared information and coordinated enforcement,” she said.
Baltimore City Sheriff Sam Cogen said that some of the details will be worked out when his office sits down with the liquor board to write up the memorandum of understanding.
“You’ll see underage alcohol enforcement,” he said. “We would do some inspections that would be community driven … You’ll see sheriff’s deputies and sheriff cars working with liquor inspectors and working with the police department, going out and doing enforcement work.”
“We’re talking about collaboration,” Cogen said. “We’re talking about using all the resources that the city has to make city residents feel safer and to be able to help the community.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_may28_neighborhoodservicesunit_baltimore2_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-29 04:00:38.583565

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland has joined another lawsuit by multiple states against the Trump administration, this time trying to block its threatened cuts to scientific research.
The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in New York, also alleges that the National Science Foundation seeks to eliminate programs designed to increase participation by women and “individuals from underrepresented groups” in science, technology, engineering and math fields, or STEM.
Between 1995 and 2017, under congressionally approved national policy, minority representation in those fields rose from 15% to 35%, the states’ suit says. But in an April 18 statement, the NSF announced that “research projects with more narrow impact, limited to subgroups of people based on protected class or characteristics do not effectuate NSF priorities.”
On that same day, the suit said, the foundation issued termination notices for projects that “seek to increase STEM participation by women, minorities, and people with disabilities; that study misinformation; and that address environmental justice.” It also applied an “arbitrary” 15% cap on indirect costs for projects, such as lab space, custodial services, biomedical disposal and administrative functions.
“Institutions will not be able to maintain essential research infrastructure and will be forced to significantly scale back or halt research, abandon numerous projects, and lay off staff,” the lawsuit says.
Maryland, other states, take more legal actions against Trump administration

Colleges and universities are already feeling the impact. Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement that the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, has lost nearly $5 million from seven programs that supported fellows, faculty diversification and research. Bowie State University, one of Maryland’s four historically Black colleges and universities, saw termination of a program to boost representation of Black males teaching STEM.
“We’re taking legal action to stop these devastating cuts so our universities can continue to train the next generation of scientists and engineers who will strengthen our economy, protect public health, and produce groundbreaking research,” Brown said.
A representative with the NSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Similar Trump administration efforts to cap indirect costs at 15% from the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Department of Energy have been temporarily blocked by courts.
In addition to Maryland, state signed onto the latest suit are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin.
On May 5, about 13 universities, the Association of American Universities, American Council on Education, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities and 13 universities or university systems filed a similar lawsuit against the foundation for trying to make drastic cuts in science research and place a 15% cap on indirect costs.
The University of Maryland Eastern Shore represents one of 19 land-grant institutions in the country.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner) OMAHA — Two decrepit buildings with an alley between them. 
That’s how developer Jay Lund recalls the defunct midtown Omaha steel plant some four years ago when his team began contemplating a conversion project that partnered with the neighboring University of Nebraska Medical Center.

On Wednesday, the site crawled with academic, business and community members for a public unveiling of the repurposed product: the Catalyst, a 170,000-square-foot co-working hub expected to incubate new medical inventions, draw talent and burnish the area’s reputation as a healthcare and research magnet. 
So far 20% full with 18 tenants, officials say investment in the private-public venture will reach about $97 million, $29 million of which is university funds and $6.3 million of which is public tax-increment financing from the City of Omaha. 
It’s the first facility to open in the EDGE District, a roughly 30-acre area across Saddle Creek Road that’s considered UNMC’s west campus and the future home of more development. UNMC is the state’s only public academic health science center, treating patients as well as discovering cures. 
“It still amazes me when I come in here,” Lund, of GreenSlate Development, said as he reflected on the before and after images of the project at 4601 Catalyst Court. 
Said partner Dean Koelbel of Denver: “It was a beast of a building from taking it apart to putting it together.”
 ‘Serendipitous collisions’

Speaking also at the grand opening was Gov. Jim Pillen, Dr. Jeffrey Gold, University of Nebraska president, Dele Davies, UNMC interim chancellor, and Corinne Wardian, facility manager.

The idea behind the Catalyst, they said, was to provide an environment where healthcare-minded academics, nonprofits, startups and businesses can network, exchange ideas and feed on a common energy.
“Serendipitous collisions,” is what Lund calls the moments when those workers bump into each other at a coffee counter or hallway and share a thought that becomes an invention.
“Innovation dies in a corporate setting,” added Koelbel.
Gold told visitors that he hopes to see the Catalyst lure talent worldwide and that he expects its tenants to help UNMC push the frontiers of research and innovation. He noted how hard academics and physicians work on the main UNMC campus but said a key is transferring knowledge to a commercial market.
“At the end of the day, until that research improves a human life, it is really just an exercise,” said Gold.
Among Catalyst’s anchor tenants are UNeMed, the technology transfer and commercialization arm of the Med Center, and UNeTech, a university affiliate that identifies and supports promising startups.
The two combined will take about a fourth of the complex, a portion of the private enterprise that’s owned by the university, which also owns the ground beneath the sprawling Catalyst.

“The upside is we’re around people that are thinking like us, want to do work like we do,” said Michael Dixon, CEO of UNeMed. “It’s like building a team within a bigger team.”
On the main floor, past a grand stairway and near an area filled with historical photos, Dixon’s team has started to move into an office area. Visitors are greeted with a trophy wall of “wins,” which currently showcases a virtual incision robot.
Over the past five years, UNeMed and the university have racked up 526 new inventions, 76 license agreements, 19 new startup companies and 732 patent applications. Each of the last five years, NU has been recognized as one of the top 100 universities in the world for creating new patented technology, Dixon said.
 Ties to State Capitol

Visitors on Wednesday got the opportunity to walk through other parts of the hulking workplace that features exposed brick, high beamed ceilings and plenty of steel reminiscent of the former Omaha Steel Works industrial plant founded in 1906.
The steel company produced parts for urban infrastructure and bridges, the railroad industry and a huge tractor company. In 1922, it was awarded the steel contract to construct the Nebraska State Capitol where state laws are made and government operations are managed.
  Shown up high is the gantry crane that used to move steel in the factory and now is part of the historic decor. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
During World War II, the complex produced landing craft tanks and artillery shells. 
“The building itself is unique because of its physical attributes,” said Lund. 
But he said its UNMC-area setting made it especially attractive. A future skywalk across Saddle Creek Road will link the main campus with the EDGE District. The planned Omaha streetcar route will connect the tenants to downtown as well.
When transforming to its modern use, the development and architectural team used the shell of the steel plant and preserved key historical touches — such as a huge gantry crane that once moved around steel and is now part of the decor.
“You cannot create this kind of stuff,” Lund said. “Once you lose it, it’s gone forever.”
The team kept a flavor of what was literally an alley between two old buildings. Now enclosed and called the Passageway, the atrium is dotted with places for workers to sit, work, dine and collaborate.
Tenants have access to a kitchen and fitness area. There’s an executive board room, a “living room” lounge.
Added was a third level. Tenant spaces range from a desk to a studio to a 10,000-square-foot office. 
On the public-facing side of the structure is a coffee shop and patios. Big Grove Brewery taproom and restaurant is to open in July. The Forge event hall is for rent to the public.
 EDGE District to grow

Koelbel and university officials said Wednesday that private investment in the project had reached $68 million, and university funds total $29 million. Catalyst of Omaha follows in the footsteps of Denver’s Catalyst, a co-working hub also developed by Koelbel.

It won’t be alone in that triangular-shaped EDGE District, as a six-story CORE research and office building is under construction. CORE stands for Campus Operations and Research Excellence, and will support computer-based research and wet lab-based research for drug discovery, oncology and other strategic areas.
A 750-stall parking garage owned by the City of Omaha is being built next to the Catalyst and will offer EDGE District parking. (Edge stands for Explore, Develop, Grow, Engage). 
Other development is planned in the district, university officials said. Pillen, a former NU Regent, said he envisions a benefit for generations.
“Its gigantic for Omaha,” he said of the new development. ”It’s huge for the state of Nebraska.”

(Photo by Deborah Yetter)Ours is the only nation in the industrialized world that has turned health care over to the private sector, subjecting all of us to life expectancy five years below the norm in other wealthy countries.
More of our babies die in the first year of life and more of our moms die in childbirth than in any other industrialized country. 
We spend twice as much per person on health care in the United States as peer countries, yet we have the highest rates of death for conditions that are treatable.
On the congressional agenda are cuts to Medicaid of more than $600 billion over 10 years. Hundreds of thousands Kentuckians are among those in the line of fire. The results will be deadly. Administration officials are determined to offset the tax cuts that will benefit the wealthiest even though it means loss of health care for millions of Americans. 
People are in the streets to stop the catastrophic damage to Medicaid. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10.3 million people would lose their Medicaid coverage by 2034 under the GOP bill. Med Pac, the independent agency that advises Congress, predicts the projected cuts will throw 8 million onto the uninsured rolls.
Med Pac has also informed Congress that the privatized Medicare plans, misnamed Medicare Advantage, that were supposed to save money are instead costing us $84 billion a year more than if those patients were in traditional Medicare.  
So this looks like an easy fix. Leave Medicaid alone. Cut out the Medicare Advantage plans, placing those patients onto the better coverage of traditional Medicare, saving more than enough money over 10 years than is needed to offset the tax cuts. Problem solved!
But in health care things are seldom simple. The Medicare Advantage patients who gained access to traditional Medicare would find themselves faced with unaffordable monthly premiums for the prescription drugs and supplemental coverage they would need. The Medicaid patients who were rescued from the firing squad will continue to suffer at the hands of the private Medicaid managed care companies that regularly deny 12% of claims, a rate double the awful rate in Medicare Advantage.
Medicaid patients would still have a hard time finding specialists. Their rural hospitals would continue to close as the Medicaid payments are insufficient to maintain the necessary infrastructure. Billions of the public funds provided for Medicaid patients would be siphoned into the coffers of the insurance companies as care, by law, is secondary to profit, in this privatized Medicaid system.
Those fortunate enough to have health care through their employers will continue to find the premiums, deductibles and co-pays beyond their means. The average family plan is now over $25,000 a year. The 15 years since the passage of health care reform have left 100 million of us in medical debt in what the Commonwealth Fund accurately calls a failing health care system.
Over 130 national and local organizations have called for a national day of action on Sat., May 31, to “Demand Health Not Profit: Put Single Payer on the Nation’s Agenda.”
On that day in 25 cities from Detroit to Houston and Seattle to Charlotte, people will gather to advocate against cuts in an already failing system and in favor of enhanced Medicare for all.
The protesters are demanding passage of a publicly financed, national single-payer program that would provide comprehensive coverage to everyone.
In Kentucky, the Rally for Health Not Profit will be at noon Saturday at the Mazzoli Federal Building in Louisville. The people there will be fighting for all of those on the firing lines and insisting that, this time around, we can remove the profits from health care and enact a plan that cares for all of us.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-29 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why isn’t DEEP killing more bears?,Susan Masino,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/why-isnt-deep-killing-more-bears/,"With multiple ways to prevent incidents and kill problem bears, where is the need to escalate to a bear hunt?","In Connecticut, all law enforcement officers and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEEP) have full authority to kill problem bears. In 2023, Public Act 23-77 also granted this authority to any farmer with a permit and anyone in self-defense. And Public Act 23-77 made feeding black bears illegal and punishable.
Despite these robust and recent tools, there is a relentless push for a bear hunt – most recently under the guise of public safety. 


But the public pays hundreds of professionals across the state to protect public safety and the public trust, and all these professionals can remove problem bears. Some of these officials also have the responsibility to educate the public, which they have been doing at recent events. The CT Bear Coalition has been providing additional science on bear behavior, prevention and non-lethal methods. 
With multiple ways to prevent problems and kill bears, where is the need to escalate to a bear hunt? Are we using the lethal and non-lethal tools we have?
People love wildlife and there are positive benefits of peacefully coexisting. Black bears are native to the region and their numbers have recovered as our forests regrew. They are not overpopulated, and the black bear population is regulated naturally by habitat and social interactions (i.e. not predators). This is a majestic and smart species with complex social relationships, another important aspect of comprehensive public education.

Susan Masino
The evidence is clear: this is an animal behavior issue. People, intentionally or unintentionally, create “problem” bears (curious bears that smell food, snoop around, find unsecured food, and develop a habit). People can deter snooping bears, and prevent problem bears by keeping bears off of the behavioral ladder of progression: BearBehavioral Ladder.indd.
Black bears, like any species, seek easy meals. One household or business that lures a bear can create a neighborhood-wide problem. A bear hunt will not solve this problem; other approaches will. Across the country there are many BearSmart communities that focus on public education, consistent deterrents, and the first critical step: removing access to easy food. The excuse that “other states are hunting bears” is nonsensical.
And there is another wrinkle: Is DEEP creating problem bears? Yankee Magazine described a study wherein DEEP put barrels of fruit, nuts, and chocolate in remote areas outside of the range of wild bears with tracking collars. Not surprisingly, bears went out of their way to eat calorie-dense food and went looking for this valuable reward even when it was no longer available. This is similar to how bears are “hunted” – baited in the forest with high-calorie human food like cereal or doughnuts (or run to exhaustion and treed with dogs). Is the agency (or employees) exploring a market for guided bear hunts?
Most people understand that hunting bears in the woods will not keep bears away from our trash barrels, birdfeeders, and screened porches. And they know that there are hundreds of professionals across the state with the authority and the responsibility to kill problem bears as needed to protect public safety. What has not been fully considered are the likely and known negative aspects of a bear hunt itself: the risks that a bear hunt will create a false sense of public complacency, will put more and larger guns on the landscape, and could result in injured and unpredictable bears in our small and densely populated state.
Language allowing DEEP to authorize a bear hunt has been inserted into S.B. 1523. The Connecticut legislature may vote on it between now and June 4. The public (and the legislature) should know that this is a direct vote for a bear hunt: DEEP has financial conflicts of interest (hunting licenses and federal kickbacks on gun and ammunition sales, although most of this money is not related to hunting). And DEEP has been advocating for a bear hunt for years (even though the public is not in favor of it). Using public safety (and creating fear) as an excuse to hunt bears is not honest.
Fully deploying our current tools will prevent and remove the problem of problem bears. What problem does a bear hunt solve? It does solve the problem that some people want to hunt bears and they are not allowed to in Connecticut – and for good reasons. A serious risk is that a bear hunt may drive bears further into what they will quickly learn are “safe” zones – like our neighborhoods. A bear hunt is not the right “tool” – unless the goal is simply hunting bears. If so, let’s be honest.
Like so many issues, community-based solutions and education are the key, along with deploying effective and proven tools and engaging in honest discourse. Instead of giving DEEP the ability to authorize a bear hunt, we should demand that they protect public safety and the public trust directly: fine people who are breaking the law, and kill truly problematic bears.

Zoning is one of those systems.,"Two young fish are swimming along when they pass an older fish, who nods and says, “How’s the water today, boys?” The two younger fish swim on until one finally turns to the other and asks, “What the hell is ‘water?’”
We often go about our lives without acknowledging the systems that shape them. Zoning is one of those systems. It dictates what can be built and where, determining how we live, how we move, and how we interact with one another. Most people don’t give it a second thought, and assume that the way our communities look is simply how they’ve always been. But our modern infrastructural paradigm is not some universal standard, the apex of civilizational development. It is the result of policies that have become outdated.

Matthew Silber
The dominant zoning model in Connecticut (single-family homes on large plots of land removed from commercial spaces) is a relatively modern innovation. It emerged in the 20th century, when local governments began implementing zoning laws to control land use. While some of the original intentions were reasonable, the drawbacks of this model have become increasingly apparent. It impedes economic growth, harms the environment, and damages residents’ quality of life. Zoning regulations in the state of Connecticut must be reformed.
Across Connecticut’s 169 towns, there are 169 different zoning codes. This byzantine patchwork of regulations makes it difficult to build housing, start small businesses, or respond to changing economic and social circumstances. Only large corporations have the necessary resources to navigate these rules. For local entrepreneurs and would-be mom-and-pop’s the system is a barrier.
The consequences are disastrous. Housing costs are soaring because zoning restrictions make it impossible to build enough homes where people want to live. By enforcing low-density development, Connecticut towns handicap their potential revenue while increasing infrastructure costs, creating onerous tax burdens for residents.
The cost of bad zoning is not only financial. When residential areas are sequestered from areas of employment, commerce or recreation, owning a car becomes a necessity. For some, driving is not a problem, but for others (seniors, people with disabilities, low-income residents) it’s a burden. More cars means more traffic, more deadly accidents, more pollution, and less nature, uprooted to make way for parking lots.
Car-centric development negatively impacts our bodies and minds. With few walkable destinations nearby, we spend more time sitting and less time moving, leading to health issues. Without accessible public spaces we become isolated. Many lament the fracturing of community in America, but the rules that govern our physical infrastructure inhibit connection: our neighborhoods offer few places for spontaneous in-person interaction.
This may sound grim, but fatalism is unnecessary. Zoning codes can be rewritten to better serve our needs. A promising path forward in Connecticut would be statewide zoning reform. Instead of 169 convoluted, often contradictory codes, we could establish a universal, statewide framework that facilitates smart development: flexible density where appropriate, increased mixed-use allowances, and less red tape to encourage small-scale, locally-driven projects.This kind of comprehensive, standardized system of zoning has worked in Japan, keeping home prices stable amidst demographic spikes.
The aim of such zoning reforms is not to turn quaint suburbs into towering mini-Tokyo’s, but to facilitate accessibility and opportunity. Personally, I want my cousin to be able to walk safely to a playground. I want to help my parents downsize without sacrificing their independence. I want my friends to start businesses and families without going broke. Rationalizing zoning restrictions across the state does not mean explosive urbanization, it means thoughtful development that reflects the real needs of real people. I do not advocate for the abolition of single-family homes on a quarter acre of land; I merely suggest that that specific use of land need not be the only legally permissible one in every instance. 
Change makes people nervous. Many worry that changes to zoning will ruin the character of their home. But preservation shouldn’t mean fossilization. Communities should be allowed to grow and adapt in response to residents’ priorities, and not just in accordance with the written directives of bureaucrats from a century ago. Users of a community should determine that community’s character, not a dusty collection of bylaws, invoked by those who would attempt to freeze time. Is the ability to walk to get your morning coffee truly a nerve-wracking proposition?
Zoning is the water in which we swim, invisible yet all-encompassing. But unlike the fish in the parable, we are able to perceive and even modify the water around us. By making reasonable adjustments to our zoning codes, we can thread the needle on many issues, building affordable homes in a state with clean air, booming businesses, and healthy residents.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-29 04:01:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Now is not the time for government-controlled health care,Katie D’Agostino,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/29/now-cts-not-the-time-for-government-controlled-health-care/,The pursuit of a state-government-controlled health insurance system would threaten the momentum CT has achieved to build a more prosperous future.,"After years of feeling like Connecticut was falling behind, our economy finally found the momentum needed to mount a major comeback in recent years. Our state rebounded faster than our peers from the COVID-19 pandemic, with employers across a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, leading the way.
By investing in infrastructure and taking the first steps to address the state’s excessive tax burden, policymakers have played a critical role. This positive progress has created new opportunities for small businesses in the Central Connecticut region and throughout the state. These small businesses power the heart of our local communities and represent 99 percent of all businesses in Connecticut. Many of these businesses are members of the Central CT Chambers of Commerce (and others) which serve as essential advocates and support networks, ensuring our local economies remain vibrant.
However, this momentum could be fleeting, and progress tenuous if policymakers in Hartford do not commit to a commonsense approach that smartly reduces, rather than expands, onerous mandates on businesses and the private market that can increase costs and stifle growth.
Health care is a major area of concern to businesses in our region, our Chamber members, and throughout the state.
We all share the goal of expanding access to high-quality care and reducing costs. But several proposals floated in the General Assembly this year would significantly undermine the state’s health care system, already straining under years of sustained increases in red tape. The result: decreased access to care, fewer options, and higher costs for employers, including many Chamber members, and the people whose coverage they sponsor.
Chambers of Commerce across Connecticut work tirelessly to advocate for policies that foster a strong business environment. The imposition of additional costly mandates or the slow erosion of private market options undermines those efforts, placing our members in a precarious position. Rising health care costs directly affect the bottom line of the businesses we represent, limiting their ability to hire, grow, and contribute to the economic vitality of their communities.
The public and private sectors can either work together to address the real causes of rising health care costs and foster competition and flexibility that will spur true savings. Or Connecticut could continue down a doomed path to a government-controlled health insurance system.
The first path is obvious. The General Assembly could pass legislation to directly implement an unaffordable government-controlled health insurance system, like a state government public option.
The second path is close to where we already are today, through the continued gradual erosion of the private health care market. Despite often starting from a basis in good intentions, added constraints on health care providers and insurers have already reduced competition and options in Connecticut. This leaves plan sponsors, like businesses and unions, with fewer options—and consumers with higher costs.
Adding to these burdensome mandates, like prohibiting critical tools that contain costs or imposing added assessments, could force more health insurers to stop offering plans in our state, ultimately creating a spiral toward no remaining competition — increasing the likelihood for politicians to rush toward the creation of a government-controlled system to fill the void.
Either path leads to the same end, and both would be costly for Connecticut’s businesses, communities, and residents.
When the State of Washington tried to implement a state government-run public option, premium costs rose, with some public option plans  more than private plans.  Colorado’s public option system resulted in an exodus of providers from the state and fewer plans for consumers to select between.
No one in Connecticut, especially not the small business community and the Chambers of Commerce that represent them, would benefit from higher taxes, rising costs, and decreased access to care. Whether by gradual attrition or direct intervention, the pursuit of a state-government-controlled health insurance system would threaten the momentum Connecticut has achieved to build a more prosperous future.
Legislators should reject both paths and instead find ways to reduce costs, increase competition, and improve access to care by working with — not against — the private sector. Listening to and strongly considering the perspectives of local businesses, including the many voices of Chamber members across the state, is crucial to ensuring Connecticut’s continued economic resurgence.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)ABERDEEN — Toby Doeden, an Aberdeen businessman, officially launched his campaign for governor of South Dakota on Wednesday evening, promising a sweeping overhaul of state government including the elimination of property taxes.
Doeden is seeking the Republican nomination in 2026 and is the second member of his party to officially declare a candidacy, after state House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids. Other Republicans frequently mentioned as potential candidates include former lieutenant governor and current Gov. Larry Rhoden, who is serving the remainder of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s second term after she resigned to join the Trump Cabinet, along with U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson and Attorney General Marty Jackley.
Rhoden signed a bill earlier this year that includes several forms of property tax relief. Doeden said he’ll go further.
“As governor, I will fight to eliminate property taxes so that each and every resident — regardless of class, color, creed or profession — can truly own their home and their land once and for all,” Doeden told an enthusiastic crowd of at least a couple of hundred supporters.
He proposed the creation of a new agency, the “South Dakota Department of External Revenue,” to identify alternative revenue sources.
First candidate for governor focuses on property rights, spending and halting ‘corporate welfare’

Doeden repeatedly criticized what he called a “bloated $8 billion enterprise,” referring to state government and its budget. He said he would create a “South Dakota Department of Government Efficiency” and promised to audit every state agency and publicly release “every line item” of spending. He also pledged to reject a salary, eliminate executive perks such as state-funded air travel, and shred all executive branch credit cards.
Doeden called for reform of South Dakota’s public education system. He pledged to refocus schools on “reading, writing, math and critical thinking,” and said classrooms should be “free from indoctrination and divisive ideologies.”
“I will work with President Trump and our Legislature here at home to develop and implement an education system that prepares our children for a future of winning,” he said.
Doeden tied his campaign closely to President Donald Trump, saying he would work to combat crime and illegal immigration. 
“Any elected official who suggests defunding the police will forfeit their right to hold office,” he said.
Doeden was introduced by state Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, who lost a 2022 primary challenge to U.S. Rep. Johnson. Among the other state lawmakers in attendance was Rep. Brandei Schaefbauer, R-Aberdeen.
“Toby is a businessman, and we need someone who understands jobs, the economy, and why people are struggling,” Schaefbauer said.
Doeden, a married father of four grown children, is the owner of Aberdeen Chrysler Center, Redfield Ford and other retail businesses and real estate.
When Doeden was publicly considering a challenge last year to Johnson, Doeden’s past social media posts drew scrutiny. He had encouraged the shooting of immigrants in gangs, used a profane insult to describe President Joe Biden, and labeled statistics about hatred of Jewish Americans as “fake.” 
Doeden ultimately decided against running for U.S. House last year. He founded a political action committee called Dakota First Action, which he used to support legislative candidates and play a role in 14 June primary losses by incumbent Republican lawmakers.
The committee faced immediate scrutiny due to a $100,000 contribution from Doeden himself. Following concerns raised about state campaign finance laws – particularly the $10,000 limit on individual contributions to PACs – Doeden amended the report, stating that the money was a loan rather than a donation. Because loans can be forgiven, critics alleged that Doeden had found and exploited a loophole allowing him to make an unlimited individual contribution.
The Legislature passed a bill this winter closing the loophole with a new requirement that any loan, when combined with contributions from the same source, cannot exceed contribution limits in state law. Had the law been in effect last year, Doeden would have been limited to a combined $10,000 of annual contributions and loans to his political action committee.
In October, Doeden and Dakota First Action hosted a fundraising event in Sioux Falls that sparked controversy for featuring a video message from North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson. CNN had recently exposed Robinson’s racist and sexually explicit comments on a pornographic website’s message board, including referring to himself as a “black Nazi,” expressing support for reinstating slavery and praising Adolf Hitler. Robinson, who was running for governor of North Carolina, lost to a Democrat in the general election.

The judges ruled in favor of Oregon and 11 other states in their suit, as well as several businesses who filed a tandem suit, and against Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores over the tariffs.
The attorneys general argued in State of Oregon et al v. Donald J. Trump et al, filed April 23, that Trump was misusing a 1977 law and falsely claiming an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the United States to justify the costly tariffs on nearly all imported goods.
The judges said that law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, “does not authorize worldwide and retaliatory tariffs,” and that, “because of the Constitution’s express allocation of the tariff power to Congress, we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.”
Lawyers for Trump and the federal agencies insinuated at a May 21 hearing they would appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if things did not go their way at the international trade court.
Trump lawyers argued the Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy in the event of a national emergency, would address the threat of fentanyl getting into the country and the U.S.’s trade deficit. The attorneys general argued Congress, not the president, has the sole authority to set tariff policy and that the tariffs Trump imposed had no relationship to the threats he said he wanted to confront.
Oregon and the other attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont — specifically challenged four of Trump’s executive orders since April that have added fluctuating tariffs on most imports from China, Mexico and Canada and a 10% retaliatory tariff on most all other goods imported from other countries to the U.S. The order from the international trade court Wednesday stops these new tariffs and more that Trump planned to impose by July 9.
Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release Wednesday that the ruling is a victory for people beyond Oregon and the states that sued.
“President Trump’s sweeping tariffs were unlawful, reckless, and economically devastating. They triggered retaliatory measures, inflated prices on essential goods, and placed an unfair burden on American families, small businesses and manufacturers,” Rayfield said. “We brought this case because the Constitution doesn’t give any president unchecked authority to upend the economy.”

Raffensperger’s two-page decision released Wednesday agreed with Administrative Court Judge Dominic Capraro’s ruling that Daniel Blackman did not meet the residency qualifications to run in PSC District 3, which includes Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties.
According to testimony, Blackman said he rented a home in Fulton County to be closer to his work while his wife and children continued to live in their Forsyth County home. Capraro found and Raffensperger agreed that Blackman was unable to provide evidence that the Fulton County property was his primary domicile.
Blackman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to state law, Blackman has 10 days from Raffensperger’s decision to file an appeal with the superior court of Fulton County. The court can affirm the decision or remand it for further proceedings and has the power to reverse or modify the decision if they find Raffensperger erred, violated the law or abused his discretion.
Early voting for two PSC seats began Tuesday with Blackman’s name on ballots statewide. If Blackman’s ban is permanent, notices will be placed in polling places advising voters of his disqualification, Raffensperger’s office said.
Three other Democrats appear on the District 3 PSC ballot: Keisha Waites, a former Atlanta City Council member and ex-state representative; Peter Hubbard, founder of the clean nonprofit Center for Energy Solutions, and Robert Jones, a former utility executive. The winner will face GOP incumbent Fitz Johnson, who was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021.

Ron Bailey/Getty ImagesThe Georgia Supreme Court upheld a state law that bars most people between the ages 18 and 21 from carrying handguns in public without military training Wednesday.
The court unanimously backed a lower court in rejecting the challenge from Thomas Stephens, a 20-year-old Georgian seeking to end enforcement of the prohibition.
Georgians between 18 and 21 can carry long guns in public, and they can carry handguns at home, in their car or in their place of business and use them for hunting, fishing or sport shooting with the associated license. But only 18- to 20-year-olds who have received weapons training as part of military service are generally able to carry a handgun in public.
Stephens’ attorney John Monroe argued that the exception is arbitrary and other young adults may be as capable of safely carrying handguns as members of the military.
“When you look at the nature of the training that a young person in the military gets, which is, as we said in our briefs, geared toward rifles and using other small arms like hand grenades, that’s not very well-suited or significant when it comes to carrying handguns in public, as opposed to training that people might get outside of the military that’s geared exactly towards carrying handguns,” he said.
The state, represented by the Office of Attorney General Chris Carr, argued that the prohibition on handguns for young adults is authorized by the Georgia Constitution as a permissible exercise of police power.
The unanimous opinion authored by Justice Andrew A. Pinson rejects Stephens’ call to overturn state precedent in favor of tests created by federal courts, describing it as a request “to uncritically import federal standards to guide the application of a provision unique to Georgia’s Constitution—a practice we have regularly criticized and disapproved.”
The state Legislature has been at the center of a debate over firearm access in recent years, especially since last September’s shooting at Apalachee High School, in which four people died. Proposals designed to encourage safe firearm storage stalled during the 2025 legislative session.

Kauth chairs the Legislature's Business and Labor Committee. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A majority of Nebraska Democrats and one Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature successfully blocked an attempt to add a proposal to slow the state’s voter-approved minimum wage increases to a bill weakening voter-passed paid sick leave. 
State Sen. Jane Raybould filed her once-defeated minimum wage proposal as an amendment to Lincoln State Sen. Beau Ballard’s Legislative Bill 415 after Speaker John Arch decided not to reschedule her stand-alone bill due to time constraints. 
Lawmakers were unable to consider the amendment — which was likely to pass — because Democratic-aligned lawmakers had already filed several motions to filibuster Ballard’s original proposal. 
Raybould said her reason for wanting to act now had to do with the political dynamics facing her bill if the lawmakers wait. She said it would be harder to reduce pay for young people after the fact.
Raybould’s revived proposal, in its current form, would shrink the wage increases by setting the annual increase at 1.75%. It also would create a youth minimum wage and amend a separate state training wage.
Raybould and supporters of her measure said her changes would protect small businesses that could not afford to pay more. Lawmakers against the legislative effort to slow wage growth said they were defending the people’s will.
“Despite continued efforts to walk back the voice of the people, I’m glad that we were at least able to fight for everyday working Nebraskans by stopping this attack on minimum wage.” State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said after the vote. 
Raybould pushed back by saying Nebraska lawmakers aren’t trying to undermine what voters approved the way Missouri and some other state Legislatures have done in recent months. Missouri recently repealed a paid sick leave law that voters approved just months before.
“We care about our working families,” Raybould said during the LB 415 debate. “These two bills help our Nebraska families.” 
Worker advocates and union leaders have spoken out against the paid sick leave and mimmutin wage changes as attempts to undermine voters. Ballard had previously said he didn’t consider Raybould’s amendment unfriendly and would have supported it. 
“It was worth a swing,” Ballard told the Examiner.
Even though Democratic-aligned lawmakers blocked Raybould’s amendment from being considered the GOP majority passed Ballard’s proposal 33-15. It adds new restrictions to the paid sick leave law Nebraska voters approved last year, which has yet to be implemented.
LB 415 would remove the voter-approved law’s blanket sick leave requirements, letting employers offer no paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, and none  to temporary workers, seasonal agricultural workers and workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees. 
Ballard said the proposal intends to clarify and make the ballot measure “more feasible” and workable for businesses.
Passage of LB 415 is the latest part of a trend of the GOP-led Legislature pushing back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters. Targets this year include voter efforts to require paid sick leave, raise the minimum wage, repeal school vouchers and legalize and regulate medical marijuana.
Raybould’s stand-alone bill will most likely be voted on next session. Though highly unlikely, Arch could change his mind about scheduling it.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — All Nebraska student-athletes will soon be legally required to play on interscholastic sports teams based on the student’s sex at birth under a legislative bill passed Wednesday at the governor’s urging.
Legislative Bill 89, the “Stand With Women Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, passed 33-16 after a one-hour debate. Speaker John Arch of La Vista limited the length of time for the third round of debate by labeling the bill as “controversial and emotionally charged.”
Nebraska will join more than two dozen states with similar laws already on the books. While LB 89’s passage is good, Kauth said, it’s not the finish line.
“We’re kind of in a marathon,” Kauth told the Nebraska Examiner. “We’re at mile three or four.”
Gov. Jim Pillen after the vote confirmed he would sign the bill into law. He said the “legislative win” would lead to “many more victories for Nebraska’s female athletes, as we ensure a level and fair playing field for all girls who compete.”

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who again led opposition to LB 89, said the bill was about “exploiting women’s sports as a proxy to attack transgender people,” particularly children, and a push for “authoritarianism.”
“It signals that we are willing to prioritize political theater over actual governance, that we are willing to criminalize difference, that we will twist Title IX, which was meant to expand opportunity for everybody, into a tool of exclusion,” Hunt said. “This bill is not about sports, and it’s not about protecting women.”
Sex definition, sports requirements
Under the bill, “sex” would be defined as whether someone “naturally has, had, will or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports and utilizes” either eggs (female, woman or girl) or sperm (male, man or boy) for fertilization.
Public school competitive sports would be restricted to students’ sex at birth, for males or females only, unless the sport is coed/mixed. There would be an exception for sports with no female equivalent team, such as football.
Private schools would need to adopt a similar policy if student-athletes compete against public institutions.
A student-athlete would need to verify sex at birth with a doctor’s note before participating in single-sex sports. Kauth said she envisions such verification coming during a student’s physical exam.

State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha said seventh grade physicians don’t include a “genital inspection” — which Kauth repeats her bill does not require — and that the bill “does not specify that the doctor has to adhere to the definition of sex that you put into this.”
“It just says that they have to answer that question,” Cavanaugh said. “In your rush to get this done, to get something to check a box, you haven’t even done it well.”
All 245 public school districts in the state, as well as community colleges, state colleges and the University of Nebraska, would need to adopt a policy complying with the new law. Enforcement of the new law would be left up to each individual school district.
Current status quo
The bill mirrors the current status quo for Nebraska schools after the Nebraska School Activities Association ended a Gender Participation Policy that had been in place since 2016. Fewer than 10 students had applied and been approved under the policy, which offered a narrow path for transgender students to participate in sports matching their gender identity.

The National Collegiate Athletic Association made a similar change earlier this year.
Both athletic associations changed their policies following executive orders from President Donald Trump to administratively define sex as binary. Pillen issued a similar executive order in 2023 that continues to apply to most state agencies.
Kauth’s LB 89 would have originally applied to school and college bathrooms and locker rooms, but at the request of State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a decisive vote for overcoming a filibuster, the bill was limited to sports.
“Sometimes making incremental steps is the best way to go,” Kauth said May 14, when the Riepe amendment moved forward to keep LB 89 moving.
The bill required at least 33 votes to move forward in the face of opposition, meaning Kauth needed Riepe or one Democratic lawmaker in his place. All Democratic lawmakers opposed the bill, as did Hunt, a nonpartisan progressive.
‘This isn’t about exclusion’

State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City, the only LB 89 supporter to speak during the limited debate, said the law “protects fairness, safety and opportunity for our female athletes.”
“This isn’t about exclusion,” he said. “It’s about ensuring our daughters, sisters and friends have a level playing field to compete, succeed and shine.”
Kauth said she was “a bit disappointed” about not being able to address school bathrooms or locker rooms this year but that she would bring those issues back in 2026. She said she and Riepe have discussed what comes next and that he has mentioned he wants to watch and see what happens in the next year, which would help determine Kauth’s next steps.

Riepe said May 14 that he would not support bathroom restrictions because he was against turning the Legislature into a “vehicle for fear, overreach and culture war crusades.”
“I did not run for office to become part of the ‘Nebraska State Potty Patrol,’” Riepe said during the most recent debate.
Pillen, speaking with the Nebraska Examiner in April, said he would accept the pared-back LB 89 “if that’s where it ends up.” He said if a boy goes into a woman’s restroom, “the rest of the boys will take care of him.”
Kauth said LB 89 would prevent self-policing and that a “high-trust society” would give faith that someone under her law is on the “right” sports team, or as in her larger bill, the “right” bathroom.
‘Political football’
Some opponents, such as Hunt and Cavanaugh, have said Kauth’s bill would lead to questions of whether anyone is allowed in the “right” bathroom or locker room, regardless of their sex or gender identity, based on their appearance.

State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha said that someday soon the “fog” against transgender Nebraskans would lift and supporters of Kauth’s bill would move on to the next “craze.” 
However, he said, lawmakers would be left with the “rubble” and how they voted.
“It’s a political football. It’s using a community as a pawn, and it’s doing so at a time when frankly the house is on fire and it’s essentially saying, ‘Don’t look over here, let’s talk about this.’ And real people, real Nebraskans, are the collateral damage of that type of activity.”

Ned Lamont over the next state budget largely by requiring public colleges and universities to tap their hefty reserves.
According to records obtained by The Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday, the administration this week presented majority Democrats with cost-saving measures worth $213 million in 2026-27. Two-thirds of that savings, about $134 million, wouldn’t necessitate curbing programs or hiking fees — but it would require the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system and the University of Connecticut to spend down combined reserves that approach $1.1 billion.
“It’s been clear for several years now that our higher ed units in this state have some structural issues,” Jeffrey Beckham, Lamont’s budget director, said Wednesday when asked about the cost-cutting ideas. “And I would welcome the General Assembly … in calling for those reforms.”
With one week remaining in the 2025 legislative session, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Democrats and Lamont were struggling to settle the second fiscal year in the next two-year state budget. Specifically, lawmakers wanted to spend about $200 million more in 2026-27 than the governor supported in an overall budget expected to exceed $55 billion. Those extra dollars also put the second half of the biennial plan in jeopardy of exceeding the constitutional spending cap.
The speaker added that Democrats were considering adopting a budget just for the upcoming 2024-25 fiscal year, rather than accepting painful cuts in 2026-27. Connecticut has been following a two-year budget cycle, which allows for greater long-range fiscal planning, since July 1993.
But while Ritter said the extra $200 million in spending in 2026-27 was essential to ensure Connecticut wouldn’t short-change higher education, K-12 schools, health care and other legislative priorities, Lamont countered during a mid-afternoon press conference that things weren’t so dire.
“I’m a little disappointed that people are giving up and saying we can’t reach an honestly balanced budget” for two years, he said.
The CT Mirror learned that the administration asked Democrats to trim their proposals for UConn and its Farmington-based health centers by $70 million next fiscal year and by $79 million in 2026-27.
The university’s main campus in Storrs and its satellite branches began the fiscal year with $171 million in reserves, a more modest 10.2% of its operating budget. UConn’s Farmington-based health center held $297 million, which represented 18% of its $1.65 billion annual operating expense.
UConn officials say most of their reserves already are committed. Some go to capital projects, and others must be held to ensure low interest rates when borrowing for dormitory and other construction work.
Lamont’s budget staff also asked legislators to trim their request for the CSCU system — which oversees community colleges, regional state universities, and online Charter Oak State College — by $55 million in 2026-27. 
CSCU officials already were planning to spend about $130 million in reserves over the next two years to cover the difference between projected system expenses and state budget assistance. But they could handle that plus the governor’s $55 million cost-trimming proposal, given that the system entered this fiscal year with $611 million in its coffers — a reserve equal to almost 52% of its nearly $1.2 billion operating budget.
The rainy day fund for the entire state budget is capped at 18% of operating expenses and was limited at 10% for much of the 2000s and 2010s.
Beckham noted that if higher education institutions don’t want to spend down these reserves to cover ongoing programmatic costs, they have other options: cutting operating expenses, boosting fees, and pursuing more research grants and philanthropic gifts.
Ritter acknowledged late Wednesday that higher ed units could offset many of the governor’s proposed cuts by tapping reserves but added that the overall package of changes Lamont sought “would have been hard” for key programs to accommodate. 
The administration also proposed trimming funds for higher education scholarships, universal free school breakfast and expanded service on the Shoreline East rail line. It also asked Democrats to reconsider the governor’s proposal to increase public transit bus fares by 25 cents per passenger ride.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, has been pushing the legislature to investigate spending throughout its public colleges and universities, arguing all units could shrink their budgets without harming programs. The minority leader said that while hefty reserves should be reduced, cost-cutting is essential as well.
“The conversation,” Candelora added, “is all about sustainability.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_BudgetDay098-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-28 22:02:33.539183

(Alaska Airlines courtesy photo)Alaska Airlines has stopped rolling out the red carpet for the opening of Alaska’s salmon season.
The airline has paused a 15-year-old program that celebrates the Copper River salmon run, one of Alaska’s earliest commercial salmon fisheries, the company confirmed by email.
For more than a decade, Alaska Airlines observed the unofficial opening of Alaska’s salmon season by flying a king salmon from Cordova to Seattle, where it was presented to chefs in a red carpet photo opportunity known as the First Fish event.
Last year, the company switched things up with an event in Boston, instead of Seattle. This year, the company didn’t publicly mark the start of the salmon season. 
“I wouldn’t describe it as an end — more of a pause. We’ve had a lot of exciting developments at Alaska Air Cargo, including the addition of new widebody cargo operations alongside our regular domestic and in-state service. Given the increased activity, we made the decision to pause this year’s First Fish event,” said Tim Thompson, Alaska Airlines’ public affairs manager, by email. 
Thompson said the company is still committed to flying out Alaska’s seafood.
“Since last Friday, we’ve already transported over 150,000 pounds of Copper River salmon out of Cordova,” he said by email.
The decision to pause the “First Fish” event comes amid an uncertain time for Alaska’s commercial king salmon fishery. 
While the state is forecasting better returns for pink, sockeye, coho and chum salmon, king salmon — formally called Chinook salmon — aren’t faring as well.
Last year, Alaska fishermen harvested 244,000 Chinook, according to figures from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This year’s harvest is expected to be only 144,000 fish, and the state has significantly restricted commercial fishing for Chinook and other species of salmon, to allow for more fish to return.
This month, a conservation group filed a lawsuit as part of a campaign to urge the federal government to list Gulf of Alaska king salmon as threatened or endangered. The same group has successfully convinced many restaurants in Seattle — Alaska Airlines’ home city — to remove king salmon from their menus.
The Alaska seafood industry has been struggling to weather economic and environmental forces over the last several years, including low prices, high operating costs and a shrunken global market share, prompting a state legislative task force and some new actions to provide aid to the industry. 
Christa Hoover is the director of the Copper River/Prince William Sound Marketing Association, which promotes the region’s fish on behalf of its fishermen.
She said that regardless of the reason for Alaska Airlines’ decision, the First Fish program will be missed as long as it’s gone. 
“It was a great, fun event for us to be part of, and we look forward to it every year,” she said. It built this really great excitement. And it wasn’t solely focused on Copper River salmon. It was timed with ours because traditionally, we start the season off, but it was just really fun. You could feel the energy of it, and then you watch that energy kind of reverberate across the country. And it was just a really fun way to start the season, and we miss it terribly.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2016-Alaska-Airlines-first-fish-photo-1024x682.webp,,,2025-05-28 22:02:33.539183

We may not win every lawsuit or campaign right now, but that doesn’t make our efforts hopeless. It makes them formative. In the spirit of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the arc of the universe bends towards justice because people keep pushing.  
The post Why cathedral thinking matters now more than ever appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE, generations of artisans worked on grand cathedrals like Notre Dame. They knew their work wouldn’t be finished in their lifetimes, but they remained committed to a purpose-driven legacy. From classrooms to courtrooms, as we contend with policy changes and legal setbacks, we need cathedral thinking more than ever.  Uncertainty surrounds us, in the United States and abroad, as public support ushers a shift toward executive-centered governance. Traditional checks and balances like judicial review, due process, and legislative oversight are increasingly considered obstacles and inconveniences—even unreliable. This reflects a longstanding tension between institutional accountability and public expectations, exposing cracks in our democratic foundation.  Some wonder whether democracy may die democratically, but we should avoid the tendency to compartmentalize change into one news or life cycle. Progress isn’t linear or absolute. Sometimes, there’s twisting, even backsliding. The whipsaw may be jarring, but our challenges are deep-seated—even centuries old. Progress is often unfinished.  In the current climate, cathedral thinking compels us to embrace long-term strategies for policymaking and community-building. It shifts our focus from instant results, like winning in court or blocking a bill, to transgenerational change and resiliency. Even if we can’t see the steeple, we lay stones guided by a clear vision of equal dignity, shared belonging, and thriving futures. Whiplashed by relentless executive orders, cathedral thinking embraces that the scaffolding for progress is “under construction.”   Civil rights history confirms that justice is not a sprint—it’s a relay race. Since social justice work rarely produces immediate wins, we must be comfortable shifting strategies and timelines — and passing the baton. Brown v. Board of Education and other landmark cases—civil rights cathedrals in their own right—were not conjured in a moment. Progress was layered, textured, and iterative: years of empowering, educating, organizing, litigating, pivoting, and waiting. Stories and interventions add to the palimpsest, with each generation enriching the tapestry of justice. Se hace el camino al andar — the path is made by walking — but sometimes it feels like climbing through rough terrain and inclement weather.      Reimagining our society requires courage, creativity, and patience. Healing past wounds takes time and transcends individual cases or campaigns. Like laying stones to build a cathedral, our collective efforts—legal advocacy, policy reform, community development, and youth engagement—form the bedrock of progress.   Even today, more than a century after its inception, Barcelona’s Sagrada Família remains under construction—progressing across lifetimes. In the same spirit, we must embrace justice’s multi-spired and multi-generational nature. We may not win every lawsuit or campaign right now, but that doesn’t make our efforts hopeless. It makes them formative. In the spirit of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the arc of the universe bends towards justice because people keep pushing.  Our elders know firsthand that the arc doesn’t bend on its own. Change didn’t magically manifest overnight in places like Selma. Crossing that bridge was powerful—it buoyed and imbued hope—but it was only one dimension of a multifaceted civil rights movement. Unrushed and unhurried, we must think about progress as sustained and durable—not just a spontaneous flash. For lawyers, this means representing one client, knowing it may change countless lives. Each case helps pave the way for breakthroughs and victories. It also means advancing ideas that may not take root until long after we are gone.  Equally important is pipeline development and strategic investment in the next generation. We should cement power-sharing, mentorship, and training into every layer of our work. Advocacy and leadership development should be interwoven if we want justice to withstand erosion.  One person alone can’t build the next cathedral. Justice and progress are collective responsibilities. Cathedrals were built by architects, engineers, masons, and patrons. Today’s struggles require time, talent, and treasure, starting with collaboration among organizers, educators, artists, business leaders, lawyers, policymakers, and donors. Regardless of shape or size, each stone becomes integral to the whole.   How we define and measure success should reflect the value of leveraging long-term strategies. More emphasis should be placed on making the ground fertile for change and planting seeds. Innovation and narrative change are critical to helping progress compound, reshaping institutions, communities, hearts, and minds. That’s why Lawyers for Civil Rights has launched an artist residency, proposed a cultural district in East Boston, and planned a small business incubator—all while filing lawsuit after lawsuit to expand access to justice.  Cathedral thinking is rooted in the belief that we’re part of something larger and unfinished. Echoing the wisdom of various faith traditions: you don’t have to repair the whole world alone, but you should play your part. The question isn’t, “Will we see it finished?” but rather, “Will we lay our stone with grace and intentionality?” Now is the time to integrate cathedral thinking into our sense-making, policymaking, grantmaking, strategic planning, and program design.  Let’s build the next cathedral, laying stones together. Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal is executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights.  The post Why cathedral thinking matters now more than ever appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sagrada_Familia.jpg?fit=966%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-28 22:02:33.539183

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A uranium mine in southern Utah is the first project to be approved under President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration streamlining the development of energy infrastructure.
Owned and operated by the Canadian company Anfield Energy, the Velvet-Wood uranium project received a green light on Friday under the federal government’s new, 14-day environmental review process for energy projects.
The permitting process for similar projects has taken years in the past — but in January, Trump declared a national energy emergency, slashing the environmental review process for a number of energy projects like uranium, crude oil, natural gas, coal, biofuels, geothermal and critical minerals.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the mining project in Utah would be the first to be reviewed. And on Friday, Anfield received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.
“This approval marks a turning point in how we secure America’s mineral future,” said Doug Burgum, Department of the Interior secretary, in a statement. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries and ensuring our military, medical and energy sectors have the resources they need to thrive. This is mineral security in action.”
Sitting near the Utah-Colorado border in San Juan County about 40 miles east of Canyonlands National Park, the Velvet-Wood project is the combination of two mines — the existing Velvet Mine, which produced nearly 400,000 tons of ore between 1979 and 1984, and the nearby Wood area, which hasn’t yet been mined according to an economic assessment from Anfield.
“We are very pleased that the Department of the Interior has greenlit our Velvet-Wood project in an expedited manner,” said Anfield CEO Corey Dias in a statement. “This confirms our view that Velvet-Wood was well-suited for an accelerated review, given that it is a past-producing uranium and vanadium mine with a small environmental footprint. The Company will now pivot to advancing the project through construction and, ultimately, to production.”
Anfield has been eyeing this site for years, purchasing it in 2015 and submitting a plan of operation to the state of Utah and BLM in 2024. According to the Department of the Interior, the operation will disturb about three acres, and much of the mining will take place underground.
The normal environmental review process usually takes local input into consideration, weighing environmental and cultural concerns against the project’s goals. That includes a public comment period that, depending on the project, can result in thousands of comments.
According to BLM documents, public input was not required because of the president’s emergency order. Still, the region’s tribal governments have concerns, as noted in BLM’s environmental assessment.
The agency met with representatives from the Hopi, Pueblo of Zuni, Navajo, Pueblo of San Felipe and Ute Mountain Ute tribes, all of whom were critical of the operation and the federal government’s expedited review.
“The Tribal Nations expressed similar concerns with the emergency procedures, water impacts, transportation, and uranium contamination,” the BLM documents read, including worries that the mining and transportation of uranium ore, which would take place near Bears Ears National Monument, could impact cultural sites.
Anfield also owns Shootaring Canyon uranium mill, located in Garfield County between Hanksville and Lake Powell. Just one of three licensed and completed uranium mills in the country, it hasn’t been operational in years — Anfield says it plans to reopen the mill, although that will require additional licensing and infrastructure improvements. If it becomes operational, the mill will be used to convert uranium ore into concentrate to be used in nuclear reactors.

SPRINGFIELD — Legislation that would require Illinois public libraries to have life-saving medications on hand for people experiencing opioid overdoses and provide staff training has unanimously passed the Illinois Senate and is now on Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk.

The legislation, House Bill 1910, was proposed by a high school student in Elgin. It would require all Illinois public libraries to maintain a supply of opioid antagonists like naloxone — a nasal spray that can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose with virtually no side effects — and have at least one staff member working at all operating hours who is trained in administering the medication.

Illinois Math and Science Academy senior Jordan Henry brought the idea for the bill to Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, after volunteering with harm reduction organizations and researching effective responses to opioid substance abuse.

“It’s a good example of how anyone can change public policy if they work at it and are dedicated and have a passion,” Moeller said. Moeller first met Henry while door-knocking one summer, and after discussing Henry’s idea for the bill, worked together with her to draft and introduce it in the spring legislative session.

“We are recognizing that having access to Narcan and opioid antagonists is a good first aid step for people who are experiencing opioid overdoses,” Moeller said.

A similar system has been implemented in the city of Chicago since 2022. Moeller said part of the idea behind the bill was to expand that benefit to all Illinois residents with support from the Illinois departments of Public Health and Human Services and the state’s Drug Overdose Prevention Program. The program is focused on distributing overdose medications to public facilities and nonprofits throughout Illinois.

New legislation expands access to these medications to public libraries statewide. (Medill Illinois News Bureau photo by Isabella Schoonover)[/caption]



“Libraries were identified as being an important institution because they’re open to the public,” Moeller said. “So having this available there makes sense.”

The bill would allow trained library workers to administer opioid antagonists to potential overdose victims on library grounds, in the immediate vicinity of libraries and at library events.

One difference between the proposed state program and the system in place in Chicago is that while Chicago generally allows anyone from the public to take and administer available medications, the state program would allow only trained library staff members to administer the medication to someone experiencing a crisis.

“We wanted to make sure that only trained individuals are using it,” Moeller said. “These medications are very safe and not very difficult to use, but there is training so that you know somebody on the library staff or a volunteer who’s working with this program will be able to administer if somebody is having an overdose in a library.”

Moeller said she is optimistic the governor will sign the measure into law.

The House Republican leadership, forced to break out a computer speed reading system nicknamed the “Demon chipmunk,” was angered by the Democrats move. 
Republican Speaker Jason White at one point threatened to have a Democratic member removed from the chamber, and refused to allow debate on the budget bills because they were being read aloud, which further infuriated Democrats.
“Lady, you are not recognized. Lady we will maintain order or you will be removed from the room,” White told Democratic Rep. Zakiya Summers during a heated exchange.
The Demon chipmunk droned on into Wednesday night and House members prepared for a long night finishing up passage of bills. The Senate adjourned until Thursday after passing all its budget bills on to the House without such hitches.

The tense legislative standoff unfolded after lawmakers failed to pass a state budget during the 2025 regular session earlier this year. Gov. Reeves called them back into special session to set a budget and prevent a government shutdown once the new budget year begins July 1.
The Republican-controlled House and Senate during the regular session were mired in political infighting over tax cuts and increases and capital projects, including many pet projects lawmakers wanted for their districts. 
Reeves called them back into special session only after Republican House and Senate leaders said they had an agreement on the more than 100 bills that make up the $7-billion state budget.
Democrats in both the House and Senate said the majority kept them in the dark as they haggled on a budget in recent weeks, and that legislative leaders would not even provide details on particulars of the budget bills even as they prepared to begin voting on them.
In recent years, rank-and-file lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have complained they aren’t provided budget details in time to vet and debate the bills.
That dispute spilled onto the House floor on Wednesday, as White’s refusal to allow debate prompted a series of rebukes from Summers. 
“Mr. Speaker, why are you treating the members like this?” Summers asked.
White responded that he was within his rights and that he would allow bills to either be read or debated, not both. 
Summers then approached White on the dais, where the two argued about legislative procedure. 
“You’re entitled to your opinion,” White told her. 
Summers later attempted to quote Bible scripture, and White threatened to remove her from the chamber if she spoke again about an unrelated topic. 
In committee, House members said the budget proposal did not provide adequate funding for health care, child care and other social services, especially as federal funding cuts loom. House Republicans said the proposed budget keeps funding for most agencies at the same level as the current budget year, with slight increases for health insurance and public pension costs. 
On education, for instance, Republicans said the proposal, correcting for an overpayment last year, funds K-12 education at the levels lawmakers have promised, including full funding of a new per-student formula.

Across the Capitol, the Senate approved its budget bills much quicker than the House, but faced similar complaints from some Democratic members. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee used a procedure to pass all of its bills at once without any debate. But senators later spent a few hours discussing and voting on the bills on the floor. 
Senate Democrats did not delay the passage of the budget, but they did vote against some of the bills or voted present because of how fast the Republican leadership pushed the budget through the Capitol. 
Senate Minority Leader Derrick Simmons, D-Greenville, said several Democratic senators refused to vote in favor of the bills because they found it unreasonable that Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosmeann and Senate leaders would not distribute drafts of budget bills ahead of time. 
“Our votes were a statement — a principled stand for a better process,” Simmons said. “We remain committed to working in good faith with our colleagues across the aisle, but we will continue to speak out and act when the process fails the people we are elected to serve.”
Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, said he sent all senators a budget summary on Sunday and encouraged them to ask Senate leaders questions about the proposed budget. 
“I think the budget is prudent and conservative,” Hosemann said. 
Most agencies in the proposed budget will see flat funding with no major increases or decreases. But many agencies will see a drop-off starting July of millions of dollars in “one-time” money, either federal pandemic funds that are drying up or state cash for projects that lawmakers are withholding this year. 
Under the budget agreement, lawmakers are planning to leave about $1 billion unencumbered. Some legislative leaders say this is prudent, given federal cuts and uncertainty in Washington. Others question whether state agencies will suffer, and contractors go unpaid on already started projects, from not having capital expense money allocated in the coming year.  
Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, noted that universities have been working under a four-year plan for construction projects and maintenance and that no money is being allocated for that.
“So if an elevator goes out, or a roof needs repair, that’s got to come out of a university’s (operating) funding?” Blount said.

Sen. Rita Potts Parks, R-Corinth, who presented the IHL funding bills, responded, “We could not come to agreement with the House (on capital projects spending), so here’s where we’re at.”
Capital expense money, or surplus revenues, has been the main delay in the two chambers agreeing to a final budget. Senate leaders only wanted to only use surplus cash to fund state projects, but the House wanted to use a large amount to fund local projects, in addition to state projects. Such local spending bills, which in recent years have been between $200 million to $400 million, are often called “Christmas tree” bills, because they contain some lawmakers pet projects.
The two chambers remained at loggerheads, so they decided to not fund state or local projects.  However, the Senate approved a measure on Wednesday that would allocate $5 million for a project at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and $13 million for improvements to LeFleur’s Bluff State Park, both in Jackson. The House has yet to consider the measure.
Some highlights of the spending agreements House and Senate leaders have reached for the coming budget year:
Medicaid: $969.9 million, a 6.69% increase
K-12 education: $3.34 billion, a .4% decrease, primarily due to a decrease in enrollment
Universities: $838.4 million, a .4% decrease
Community colleges: $299.4 million, a .22% increase
Department of Corrections: $438.2 million, a 4.4% increase

The judges ruled in favor of Oregon and 11 other states in their suit, as well as several businesses who filed a tandem suit, and against Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores over the tariffs.
The attorneys general argued in State of Oregon et al v. Donald J. Trump et al, filed April 23, that Trump was misusing a 1977 law and falsely claiming an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the United States to justify the costly tariffs on nearly all imported goods.
The judges said that law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, “does not authorize worldwide and retaliatory tariffs,” and that, “because of the Constitution’s express allocation of the tariff power to Congress, we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.”
Lawyers for Trump and the federal agencies insinuated at a May 21 hearing they would appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if things did not go their way at the international trade court.
Trump lawyers argued the Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy in the event of a national emergency, would address the threat of fentanyl getting into the country and the U.S.’s trade deficit. The attorneys general argued Congress, not the president, has the sole authority to set tariff policy and that the tariffs Trump imposed had no relationship to the threats he said he wanted to confront.
Oregon and the other attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont — specifically challenged four of Trump’s executive orders since April that have added fluctuating tariffs on most imports from China, Mexico and Canada and a 10% retaliatory tariff on most all other goods imported from other countries to the U.S. The order from the international trade court Wednesday stops these new tariffs and more that Trump planned to impose by July 9.
Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release Wednesday that the ruling is a victory for people beyond Oregon and the states that sued.
“President Trump’s sweeping tariffs were unlawful, reckless, and economically devastating. They triggered retaliatory measures, inflated prices on essential goods, and placed an unfair burden on American families, small businesses and manufacturers,” Rayfield said. “We brought this case because the Constitution doesn’t give any president unchecked authority to upend the economy.”

Rowland, former CT governor",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/28/john-rowland-donald-trump-pardon/,"Rowland, the thrice-elected and twice-convicted former governor of Connecticut, said he was “humbled and appreciative” Wednesday after learning he was the recipient of a pardon from President Donald J. Trump","John G. Rowland, the thrice-elected and twice-convicted former Republican governor of Connecticut, said he was “humbled and appreciative” Wednesday after learning he was the recipient of a pardon from President Donald J. Trump.
Politico was the first to report Rowland was among the latest recipients of pardons from Trump. The Connecticut Mirror was first to report a month ago that a discreet effort was underway exploring the possibility of clemency.
“I am very humbled and appreciative,” Rowland said via email. “I have been blessed with a wonderful family and friends that have been through a great deal over the years. This is a wonderful final resolution.”
Retired FBI agents who investigated him begged to differ, as did a member of the bipartisan impeachment committee whose inquiry prompted his resignation as governor nearly 21 years ago.
“It’s a sad day for justice. Rowland deserved what he got, “ said Charles Urso, a former FBI agent who worked on Rowland’s first case, which involved bid rigging. “It’s a misuse of pardons to let off politicians.”
Mike Clark, a retired FBI supervisor who later served as a Republican member of the Farmington town council, said news of the pardon ignited an angry and incredulous text chain.
“We don’t understand the rationale behind it,” said Clark, who worked on the first case and had a unique view of the second.  “The public trust has to be upheld. When people stop believing in government, it starts to be a a big problem for government. Rowland betrayed that trust several times.”
Michael Lawlor, who was a Democratic member of the impeachment committee, said, “John Rowland left an indelible stain on our state and its government. Donald Trump is the least credible person in the country to remove it.”
Rowland was a rising star in Republican politics, elected to Congress at age 27 and governor at 37. But he went to prison at 47, and again at 57, after unrelated federal convictions. At 67, he sought the pardon.
Facing impeachment and a federal investigation into bid-rigging involving gifts and favors from state contractors, Rowland resigned July 1, 2004 at nearly the mid point of his third term. He pleaded guilty to a corruption charge on Dec. 23, 2004. Three months later, he was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, ultimately serving 10 months. 
He was indicted a second time in 2014, accused of soliciting congressional candidates in 2010 and 2012 to secretly pay him as a consultant in campaigns for his old 5th Congressional District seat in violation of campaign finance laws. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.
Clark, the former FBI agent, was one of the candidates for the Republican congressional nomination in 2012 when Rowland agreed to secretly promote and advise the candidacy of a rival, Lisa Wilson-Foley. At the time, Rowland was host of a popular evening drive-time show on WTIC-AM.
Rowland, who turned 68 this month, raised money for the Prison Fellowship after his second release. He was among the VIP mourners at the recent funeral of his former lieutenant and successor, M. Jodi Rell.
In response to the Rowland scandal, Rell negotiated with lawmakers a bill creating the Citizens’ Election Program, a voluntary system of publicly financing campaigns. The law barred contributions by state contractors and restricted the role of lobbyists in funding campaigns.
News of the pardon comes a day after a ceremony celebrated the 20th anniversary of the program and the 50th anniversary of the creation of the State Elections Enforcement Commission.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3192.jpg,,,2025-05-28 21:00:15.746590

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — After nearly three hours of oral arguments Wednesday, an Oklahoma County district judge said he isn’t ready to rule on a legal challenge to the state’s controversial social studies standards.
District Judge Brent Dishman said he wanted to wait for a written response from the group challenging the standards after the Oklahoma Board of Education moved to dismiss the case, arguing that critics failed to point to any violation of statute, and the state agency followed the process as required by law. 
Dishman has been asked to either implement an injunction to block the standards from being implemented or to dismiss the legal challenge outright.
A group of seven Oklahoma parents, grandparents and teachers represented by former Republican Attorney General Mike Hunter have sued and asked Dishman to nullify the controversial academic standards, which include language about discrepancies in the 2020 election, the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and biblical lessons.

Michael Beason, the state Department of Education’s attorney, argued Wednesday that the lawsuit is a waste of taxpayer dollars as the defense “searches for a needle in a haystack.” He said a handful of educators don’t like the standards and the plaintiffs “do not have a case recognized under Oklahoma law.”
The plaintiffs, though, argued the process used to implement the rules was flawed and the results are not “accurate” or “best practices” for academic standards. 
The new academic standards for social studies are reviewed every six years, but state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who was not present at Wednesday’s hearing, enlisted national conservative media personalities and right-wing policy advocates to aid in writing the latest version of the standards this year. 
Around half of the members of the state Board of Education later said they weren’t aware of last minute changes Walters made to the standards, but only one board member, Ryan Deatherage, voted against them. While lawmakers allowed the standards to take effect, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle called for them to be sent back to the board to be reconsidered.
After the hearing, Hunter said he appreciated Dishman’s “careful interest” in the arguments and that he expected a ruling by the end of June. 
“Despite the arguments of the defendants, there has to be a recourse by citizens when there’s a process like this that is so flawed,” he said. “No vote by the Legislature and then an action of a state agency becomes law. If we believe the defendant’s arguments today, that Oklahoma citizens have no recourse in this situation based on a strained construction of the statutes, I just don’t think that’s good government, and I don’t think that that’s a correct argument, nor do I think the judge is gonna buy it.”
James Welch, an Oklahoma teacher and plaintiff in the case, testified at Wednesday’s hearing that the review process was not a true “collaboration of experts in the field and teachers in the classroom” like he thought it would be. 
Using a math analogy, the judge asked Welch, a volunteer member of the standards writing committee, if he would feel the same way about the standards and process if the subject were instead math and the standards omitted trigonometry. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Welch said he would because omitting the most up-to-date standards of learning means students don’t achieve full understanding of a subject. 
While the defense did not comment after the hearing, they argued that the plaintiffs could not point to a specific violation of law and simply didn’t like what was in the standards. 
Chad Kutmas, an attorney for the state Board of Education, said the plaintiffs “complain about how the sausage is made, but that’s just how it’s made.” 
“Everyone knew it was going on and the political body let it happen,” he said. “It’s inappropriate for a court to step in at this late stage.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)From snipes about turning the great white north into the 51st state to booing during “The Star-Spangled Banner”, the U.S. relationship with its northern neighbor and closest ally has seemingly soured since the election of President Donald Trump. 
However Pete Hoekstra, the United States ambassador to Canada, offered a significantly more positive outlook during the Mackinac Policy Conference Wednesday, telling the attendees that President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney are aligned in their goals of revitalizing each of their nation’s economies. 
“Can you imagine what happens in North America if the Canadian economy is booming and the U.S. economy is booming at the same time?” Hoekstra asked.
“We’ve got strong leadership, committed to economic growth, committed to the same types of economic principles who want to get to a deal. That gives me a lot of optimism,” Hoekstra said. 
However, there are some obstacles, Hoekstra said, notably pointing to the lack of a pro-American trade voice in Canada, noting that several provinces have banned the sale of American alcohol in retaliation to Trump’s tariff policies. 
These issues are pebbles in the shoes, Hoekstra said, predicting that the U.S. and Canada would mend fences sooner rather than later. 
Carney appears to be serious about meeting Canada’s NATO defense spending targets, Hoekstra said, and Canada has shown interest in participating in the United States’ “Golden Dome” missile defense system. 
In contrast to Hoekstra’s optimism, Carney recently was quoted as saying that the “process of deepening integration” with the U.S. is “over” and that Canada was in a position now “where we co-operate when necessary, but not necessarily co-operate.”
Jacques Shore, a partner in the Ottawa-based law firm Gowling WLG, told Michigan Advance that Carney’s stance is one born out of necessity. 
Shore, a past leader of the firm’s National Government Affairs Group, said that while Hoekstra has been making an effort to actually meet Canadians, which is appreciated, in and of itself it can’t erase the downturn in relations.
“I would say the pebbles in the shoes are relatively recent, because they have really come about as a result of a new focus of the President in the way in which he views Canada,” Shore said. 
In reaction to Hoekstra’s comments, Shore said there is a sense that what had been a strong partnership between the two nations is now under some risk because of what’s been said by Trump, but that’s not to say that Canada is not “absolutely engaged” in wishing to do everything it can to restore the relationship.
However, Shore says the President’s comments about making Canada a 51st state do not sit well with citizens of a proud and sovereign nation.
“I think that our Prime Minister said it extremely well when he made the comment that he has through the last election period spoken with the owners of Canada, which is obviously the citizens of Canada, and I don’t think he necessarily even needed to have a campaign to see that Canadians are perfectly happy being Canadians, having the country that they have, continuing to build the country they have, without becoming part of the United States,” Shore said.
Regardless, Hoesktra said while negotiations won’t be easy, the U.S. and Canada could both see benefits to their manufacturing and energy industries if they reach a deal. 
Joining Hoekstra on stage, WOOD-TV reporter Rick Albin pressed the ambassador on the speed bumps on reaching a deal, and whether this would be a short term or long term concern. 
“I think the president, and from what I’m hearing from my Canadian sources, are that the President and the Prime Minister would like to get to a resolution sooner rather than later,” Hoekstra said, emphasizing the American and Canadian jobs at stake. 
According to the Detroit Regional Chamber’s 2025 state of the region report, 234,000 jobs in the Detroit Region alone rely on trade and investment with Canada.
“Again, the President is focused on economic growth and prosperity for the American people, which means engagement with Canada as our number two trading partner.  And the interrelationships we have on the auto industry and the interrelationships that we have on energy, we can become a global powerhouse,” Hoekstra said, noting that cooperation would allow both nations to compete with China on automotive manufacturing and the Middle East on energy. 
Additionally, energy is crucial for AI development, Hoekstra noted. Canada also has critical minerals and an integrated structure with the United States auto industry, Hoekstra said, emphasizing China is both nation’s competition. 
When asked if the U.S. and Canada could reach a zero sum deal or if tariffs would remain on both sides, Hoekstra said the president had made it clear there would be tariffs for every country looking to do business with the U.S. 
However, in negotiating with his Canadian colleagues, Hoekstra said there’s no reason why trade between the U.S. and Canada couldn’t be the least restrictive in the world in regards to tariffs.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha took a break Wednesday from his breathless legal pursuit of President Donald Trump’s administration to chase a different foe: pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
“The cost of drugs is astounding,” Neronha told reporters gathered at his South Main Street office in Providence. “Pharmacy benefit managers…operate in a very secretive and shrouded way…Because they have 80% of the market, they’re able to use that market power to drive drug prices sky high and keep that difference.”
A lawsuit filed Tuesday in Rhode Island Superior Court against three of the nation’s biggest PBMs — CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx — is perhaps the sharpest prong among many in a sweeping plan to restructure the way Rhode Island funds health care unveiled Wednesday morning. All of the initiatives in Neronha’s heavy slate of proposals are meant to remedy what Neronha called a “spectacular failure” that has been years in the making.
“It was looming then,” Neronha said Wednesday of the state’s health care crisis when he took office in 2019. “It’s here now.” 
In about 34 minutes of opening remarks, Neronha detailed his office’s new list of efforts to effect major change, from boosting mediocre Medicaid reimbursement rates to filling absences in primary care practices. The entire plan is available on a new website, titled “A Way Forward,” which went live during the press conference.
The health care system in Rhode Island is so bad, Neronha offered, that even the state’s largest hospital corporation doesn’t want to buy hospitals here but instead shops for prospects in Massachusetts. Neronha cited Brown University Health’s 2024 purchase of Saint Anne’s Hospital in Fall River and Morton Hospital in Taunton.
“There are struggling hospitals right here in Rhode Island,” Neronha said. “Why are they buying them in Massachusetts? Because the reimbursement rates are higher. It’s always about the money. Don’t let anyone convince you that it’s not about the money.”
The rollout of initiatives came a week after Neronha announced he secured an $11 million settlement with Barletta Heavy Division Inc., the Massachusetts contractor accused of dumping contaminated soil during construction of the Route 6/10 Interchange in Providence. Neronha steered most of the money toward dental care for children in low-income neighborhoods near the construction site. Unlike with multistate lawsuits where proceeds go directly to the state’s general fund, the term-limited Neronha said his office had the authority to decide where the money goes.
“We really started rolling out what we’re doing last week with the Barletta settlement,” Neronha said. “The question was, ‘What do we do with that money and how do we solve a problem?’…It became very clear to me that if we had this pot of money and we could use it to drive it back into those neighborhoods, to at least address that community problem and hope to solve it, then that action would make a difference.”
After Neronha’s monologue, seven of his staff attorneys came up to the podium one by one to describe the details of the AG’s plan, including the PBM lawsuit, which targets the three companies who make up around 80% of the national market for managing insurers’ prescription drug benefits for patients.

The lengthy complaint alleges that PBMs extract billions in rebates while reimbursing pharmacies below cost. These shadowy maneuvers, the lawsuit claims, threaten the survival of independent pharmacies, deceive consumers, and inflate drug costs via intricate manipulation of pricing schemes.
Sarah Rice, deputy chief of the office’s civil division, told reporters that PBMs will demand manufacturers offer rebates on certain drugs if they wish to be distributed through PBMs’ networks. That leads manufacturers to increase prices, and PBMs then shave a little off the top by taking a portion of the rebate, according to Rice. 
“The health plans pay more, and consumers pay more,” Rice said. “All of this is set out in much better detail in the complaint, if you are ready to read over 200 paragraphs of allegations.” 
The complaint was filed under state laws on deceptive trade practices, Rice said, “Because this behavior is harmful to consumers. It has a direct pocketbook effect to any consumer that has a deductible or co-insurance when they go to the pharmacy, which is most of us.”
The suit also identifies three group purchasing organizations (GPOs) — Zinc Health Services, Ascent Health Services, and Emisar Pharma Services — as defendants. PBMs use their organizations to aggregate their purchasing power for pharmaceuticals — a more recent development as benefit managers usually had “enormous bargaining power on their own,” the lawsuit explains.
“It appears PBMs use GPOs to recategorize existing income streams and generate new income streams,” the lawsuit reads. “GPOs also serve as an additional, non-transparent layer in an already opaque system, making it even more difficult for health benefit plans to determine whether they received their fair share of rebates.”
Neronha’s office is seeking injunctive relief, civil penalties, and full restitution for affected patients and pharmacies. The complaint aligns Rhode Island with a growing cohort of states, including Ohio, Arkansas, and Mississippi, that have started legal battles with PBMs for pricing tactics or rebate sleights-of-hand.

CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault defended the Woonsocket-based company against the lawsuit’s claims in a statement Wednesday.
“It’s surprising and unfortunate that Rhode Island’s attorney general would use biased and incorrect assertions about our industry to needlessly attack a hometown company,” Thibault wrote. “CVS Health contributes nearly $3 billion of positive economic activity in Rhode Island each year, and we employ more than 7,000 colleagues across the state.”
Thibault said CVS saved customers nationwide over $40 billion last year, with members paying under $8 on average for a 30-day prescription. She also cited an increase in independent pharmacies over the past six years, which the company says are reimbursed at higher rates than CVS stores, including its 62 Rhode Island locations. 
Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid
Neronha’s plans include support in three major areas of legislation, including some bills he hopes will pass before the legislative session ends next month. Most prominent in the AG’s machinations is a reevaluation of Medicaid rates, illustrated by a presentation slide at the press conference. 
A hypothetical Medicare reimbursement may pay a provider $100, the slide showed. A commercial insurer might reimburse the provider at $200 for the same service, but Medicaid might only pay $37 — a problem in a state where Medicaid factors heavily into the payer mix, or makeup of different insurance types among the population. About 70% of Rhode Islanders are on public insurance, either Medicare or Medicaid, according to a report accompanying Neronha’s action plan. 
That’s why Neronha is supporting H6373, sponsored by Exeter Democratic Rep. Megan Cotter, which would immediately increase Medicaid payment rates to be on par with Medicare payments. The bill was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Finance on Wednesday. Retooling the reimbursement rates would conservatively cost $50 million, Neronha said.
“We can find it in our state government, a $14.2 billion budget,” Neronha said.
A year to the day ago, Neronha argued passionately to save the state’s safety net hospitals to a who’s who of lawmakers and health care leaders at a Rhode Island State House health care summit. On Wednesday, Neronha reiterated several of the same points, and said that the lamentable case of Rhode Island’s two safety net hospitals — Our Lady of Fatima and Roger Williams Medical Center — taught him valuable lessons in how reimbursement rates work.  










It’s surprising and unfortunate that Rhode Island’s attorney general would use biased and incorrect assertions about our industry to needlessly attack a hometown company.

“That’s where I learned that there’s a problem in health care, a structural problem that’s going on here,” Neronha said. “And what is it? Our reimbursements are too low. They’re too low in Medicare, they’re too low in Medicaid, they’re too low in commercial.”
The hospitals remain in a purgatory of ownership, with the finalization of the two properties’ transfer from Prospect Medical Holdings to new owner Centurion Foundation still incomplete as of Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, Gov. Dan McKee submitted a budget amendment that would infuse $4.3 million in state money for a 21-bed long-term behavioral health care inpatient unit at Fatima.  
Hoping to preempt similar situations, one of Neronha’s more assertive proposals would let his office petition Superior Court to place financially distressed or poorly run hospitals, especially those under private ownership, into receivership. The corresponding bill is H6369, sponsored by Rep. Susan Donovan, a Bristol Democrat. On Wednesday, it was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Judiciary.
“This is something, frankly, that we talked about with Prospect before we got to where we are today,” Neronha said.
To complement that legislation, Neronha is proposing a regulation that would require Rhode Island-based medical groups to notify the AG’s office of any acquisition or restructuring involving private equity or the consolidation of large practices. A public hearing on the proposed rule is scheduled for July 8.
“One thing that we know we don’t know is the level of private equity intrusion into the health care market outside of hospital systems,” Neronha said. “We have great insight into hospital systems because of our regulatory authority over hospital systems, but not into health care practices, and we believe that we need to know so we can head off any problems.”
Neronha wants to almost universally eliminate prior authorization processes for primary care providers, except for certain controlled substances or in documented cases of physician fraud, via bill H6317 sponsored by Rep. Mia Ackerman, a Cumberland Democrat. The bill was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Health and Human Services on May 9, and is still waiting for a hearing date.  
Prior authorization acts as a lever on insurance claims and is meant to help insurers contain unnecessary costs, but it has also been criticized as an example of payer overreach and a seriously demanding time constraint on already overworked physicians. Jordan Broadbent, the office’s insurance advocate, told reporters the move to abolish prior authorization is “bold legislation” and would make Rhode Island a national leader should it pass.
Primary care in critical condition
Backing Neronha’s claims are two reports — one focused on the past, the other on the future. The Statewide Health Care Capacity Assessment features the retrospective data and was compiled by the consulting firm Health Management Associates, who found deep gaps in primary care access and coverage, wobbly long-term financing across different kinds of providers, and understaffed and overworked emergency departments.
According to the report, there are roughly 100,000 Rhode Island adults without a primary care provider, an ongoing issue recently exacerbated by the impending closure of Anchor Medical Associates’ remaining offices. 
The report also found poor outcomes for nursing homes, which boast a closure rate twice the national average. An additional nursing home closed shortly after the report was being prepared last summer, said Dorothea Lindquist, health care senior litigation attorney at the AG’s office. Lindquist also noted that four providers of Medicare Advantage plans in Rhode Island — which account for over 56% of Medicare enrollees statewide — have not raised their post-acute care reimbursement rates in a decade.
“This finding should be terrifying to everyone in Rhode Island who plans to find themselves aging here,” said Lindquist.
Another policy brief included in the AG’s package comes from the Collaborative for Health Policy and Reform Analysis (CAHPR) at the Brown University School of Public Health. The dossier reinforces load-bearing planks in Neronha’s plans, including enhanced regulatory authority over health care transactions and expansion of primary care access. 
“The proposals vary in scope, legal complexity, and political feasibility, but each offers a potential pathway for meaningful reform,” according to the brief, which discusses a state-based, single-payer plan, a comprehensive public option, pricing parity for Medicaid reimbursements and widening the state’s drug purchasing pool beyond state employee coverage.
The Brown collaborative’s recommendations and Neronha’s stratagems differ from those outlined in a primary care stabilization strategy recently announced by Gov. Dan McKee, which emphasized more gradual reform via existing regulatory mechanisms and a future review of Medicaid rates. Neronha called McKee’s April 29 announcement of a long-term primary care strategy “slapdash,” and the attorney general’s plan is contrastingly nimble, in his own evaluation.
“Everything we’re gonna roll out today is action we believe will make a difference,” Neronha said.



Neronha’s complete set of health care reforms
The complete set of initiatives included in Neronha’s wishlist, as listed in a press release from his office:

File suit against the three largest Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) in the country to protect Rhode Island consumers from unfair and deceptive conduct that has caused drug prices to skyrocket;
Introduce legislation to immediately raise Medicaid reimbursement rates to 100% of Medicare rates for primary care providers;
Introduce legislation to immediately eliminate nearly 100% of prior authorization requirements for primary care providers;
Introduce legislation authorizing the Attorney General to petition the Superior Court to place a hospital into receivership if the facility becomes financially unstable;
Issue proposed regulations to require pre-merger notification of certain material corporate transactions involving medical practice groups, including transactions involving private equity firms;
Issue an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking regarding market oversight of artificial intelligence (AI);

Dave McCormick said Wednesday a pending merger between U.S. Steel and Japan’s Nippon Steel would preserve America’s control of the company and bring billions of dollars to Allegheny County’s Monongahela River Valley.
In an interview on CNBC, McCormick said the company’s control structure would be subject to a national security agreement with the federal government. The deal was in limbo for much of last year as President Joe Biden awaited a recommendation from the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States over the security implications of a sale. 
McCormick said the CEO and a majority of the board of directors for the American subsidiary of Nippon would be U.S. citizens. He also described a “golden share” of the company that would require U.S. government approval of a number of the directors.
“That will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren’t cut and things like that, and  also allow the investment to come to the Mon Valley,” McCormick said, noting the agreement would save about 10,000 U.S. jobs, including nearly 4,000 in Pennsylvania.
Of the $14 billion that Nippon would invest in U.S. Steel, at least $2.4 billion would be in the Mon Valley, McCormick said. That would include the construction of a new electric arc furnace that McCormick claimed would create another 10,000 jobs in the building trades.

“This is being extremely well received in Pennsylvania,” he said. “The steel workers there are wildly excited about it, and I think it’s going to be a great thing for my state.”
But, United Steelworkers (USW), the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker’s largest employees union, expressed concern that details of the proposed tie-up remain sparse. USW said it has received no assurance the new investment would be directed to union-represented plants or toward “genuinely new capital improvements as opposed  to routine repair and maintenance.”
“Further, Nippon has not disputed reports that suggest up to $4 billion of the $14 billion would be earmarked for greenfield operations — and our members already know that our plants are not ‘greenfields,’ and generally that means non-union,” USW leaders said in a statement. 
In a post Friday on Truth Social, President Donald Trump described the deal as a “planned partnership” between U.S. Steel and Nippon, which began courting the American company in late 2023 with a $14 billion all-cash offer. Trump is scheduled to speak Friday evening at U.S. Steel’s Irvin Plant in West Mifflin. 
Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not respond to a request for comment. 
Trump, who has vacillated between support and opposition to the deal, said in the post the companies had negotiated an arrangement that would keep the headquarters in Pittsburgh and that his tariff policies would ensure “steel will once again, forever, MADE IN AMERICA.”
The USW noted Trump’s post promised much of the $14 billion investment would occur in the next 14 months. That timeline would closely align with the expiration of the union’s labor agreement.
“Our core concerns about Nippon Steel — a foreign-owned corporation with a documented history of violating U.S. trade laws — remain as strong and valid today as ever,” the USW statement said. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro said Tuesday that he was “cautiously optimistic” following Trump’s announcement, but added that much work remains to be done. He said he had engaged with elected leaders of both parties and union officials to understand what they were proposing, make sure it benefits Pennsylvania and protects the commonwealth’s workers and steelmaking industry.
“I don’t want this to be something our kids read about in the history books. I want this to be a place where people today want to go work and where their kids want to go work tomorrow,” Shapiro said, adding that he spoke with Trump about the merger when he called in the days  after the April 13 arson attack on the Governor’s Residence.
Shapiro said he emphasized, “the need to make sure the investment was richer, that the jobs would be protected, and that there would be a pathway to growth.”
In response to Trump’s post, Democratic U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, whose Allegheny County district includes the Mon Valley, said consideration of workers and their communities must be central to the deal.
“What remains non-negotiable is our commitment to protecting the thousands of union jobs that anchor entire neighborhoods and communities across western Pennsylvania. Our region knows all too well what happens when decisions are made without putting workers, local community investment, and resident health at the center of the conversation,” Lee said.
Among U.S. Steel’s two dozen locations, three separate plants in the Mon Valley outside Pittsburgh and one in Fairless Hills, outside Philadelphia, comprise the Mon Valley Works.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-28 23:23:13+00:00,CT Mirror,"Lamont denies threatening to veto safe injection site proposal, despite reports",Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/28/ct-safe-injection-sites-lamont/,Lamont denied reports that he threatened to veto an omnibus public health bill over a measure allowing for overdose prevention centers in CT.,"Governor Ned Lamont denied Wednesday that he threatened to veto Senate Bill 7, a public health omnibus bill, over a measure that allows for the establishment of safe  injection sites in Connecticut, despite reports from House Speaker Matt Ritter that he had.
Whatever the truth was, confusion over the governor’s intentions led lawmakers to strip the provision from the bill to ensure passage of the broader legislation later this week.
Safe injection sites, also known as safe consumption sites or overdose prevention centers, are facilities where people can bring illegal substances to use under the supervision of trained staff in a clean environment with access to safety supplies, like clean needles and naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses. 
Last week, a measure passed as part of a broader bill in the Senate allowing Connecticut to set up safe injection sites, though it prevented the use of public funds for the effort. The bill was slated for a House vote this week, but didn’t go to the floor Wednesday amidst reports of Lamont’s opposition. 
During a press conference at the state Capitol that afternoon, Lamont denied having made a decision regarding a veto, though he acknowledged he had concerns about bringing such facilities to Connecticut.
“I do have some worry about the perception of safe injection sites in our major municipalities, but I haven’t made a call on that yet,” Lamont said.
Ritter said he had heard the exact opposite from the governor’s staff, so he had encouraged legislators to amend the bill to remove the measure ahead of a House vote slated for this week in the interest of preserving the broader legislation. 
“The Governor’s chief of staff told us the Governor would veto the bill as it is currently written,” Ritter said in an emailed statement. “I always urge chairs to explore all options to get legislation across the finish line. It would be a shame to lose the legislation to a veto if there are some changes that would protect most of the important health care policies that the chairs and advocates have been working on for months.”
Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, confirmed Wednesday evening that, despite supporting safe injection sites, she approved an amendment to remove the measure from the bill and hopes it will go to the House floor for a vote tomorrow. 
“The more I learned about this way of saving people’s lives, the more I believed in it,” McCarthy Vahey said. “That policy desire bumps up against the practicality and also the clear communication from the governor that he is planning to veto the bill if it were to pass.”
McCarthy Vahey clarified that she did not speak directly with the governor and had only heard about his comments from others.
Supporters of safe injection sites point to research that they decrease overdose deaths, disease transmission and public disorder. Despite the body of research establishing their public health benefits, the sites remain controversial. Critics say they encourage illegal drug use and express concerns about the impact of the facilities on surrounding communities.
Overdose prevention advocates, awaiting full passage in the House this week, gathered at the state Capitol on Wednesday morning to express support for the safe injection sites and denounce the reported efforts by Lamont to kill the effort.
“I’m just tired of watching my friends die,” said Cameron Breen, an overdose survivor who now works in overdose response. Breen pushed back against the connotation he says some people have of safe injection sites as “sanctioned drug dens.”
“The reality is it’s a quiet, clean, safe space for people to come with the only role of making sure that when they use they do not die. Currently, they’re dying in cars, they’re dying in bedrooms. They’re dying in public bathrooms,” Breen said.
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, Senate co-chair of the Public Health Committee and a physician, expressed disappointment that the measure was being removed, and said it made clear that the governor was not forthcoming about his intentions.
“I’m disappointed that the governor was not forthcoming with the media. For the House to hear him directly saying to the media that he’s not going to veto it and then still remove the measure should be very confusing,” Anwar said.
McCarthy Vahey said she still looks forward to the measure passing in the near future, and wants to start that work immediately.
“We have to be thinking about, if we can’t get this passed now, how do we start that conversation today so that we can do this bill next year? So that the governor’s on board, so that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are on board,” McCarthy Vahey said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/overdose-prevention-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-28 20:07:46.287570

SPRINGFIELD – Gov. JB Pritzker said Wednesday he will not sign a budget that includes broad tax hikes to fund new spending as lawmakers are in the final hours of budget negotiations.
“Anything that’s broad-based and would have a negative impact on working families, I would veto a budget like that,” Pritzker told reporters.

SPRINGFIELD – Gov. JB Pritzker said Wednesday he will not sign a budget that includes broad tax hikes to fund new spending as lawmakers are in the final hours of budget negotiations.

“Anything that’s broad-based and would have a negative impact on working families, I would veto a budget like that,” Pritzker told reporters.

Pritzker said he would specifically veto any budget that includes tax increases on individuals, corporations or the sales tax – the three largest sources of revenue in the state budget. Pritzker also ruled out a sales tax on services to provide new funding to the state.

Personal income tax growth in Illinois has remained strong, up 10% through for fiscal year 2025 as compared to the same point in fiscal year 2024, according to the legislature’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. But sales taxes have been stagnant, and corporate income tax is down 8% for the year.

While Pritzker ruled out “broad-based” tax increases, it’s not clear whether he’d approve more targeted tax increases, particularly those that may not directly be paid by “working families.” The governor pushed about $900 million of targeted tax changes on businesses and sportsbooks to balance the FY25 budget but proposed only a $100 million tax increase on electronic gambling and table games at casinos in his FY26 proposal.

Pritzker told reporters he also hasn’t reviewed any possible revenue sources, including tax increases, to fund a budget gap for Chicago-area public transportation agencies. Pritzker added he also isn’t pushing lawmakers to adopt any specific funding sources for it.

Illinois lawmakers are in the final days of negotiations over the fiscal year 2026 budget set to take effect on July 1. But growing uncertainty about revenue projections next year has left Democrats in a difficult spot as they seek funding for programs.

Pritzker proposed a $55.2 billion spending plan to state lawmakers in February, but revenue projections for FY26 have decreased to $54.9 billion, giving lawmakers even less room to increase spending without finding more money to pay for it.

Democrats have reviewed lists of possible tax hikes on specific transactions in closed-door meetings over the last week. It was still unclear as of Wednesday afternoon which, if any, tax increases would be included in the final budget proposal.

Democratic leaders have tempered expectations for their members.

“The biggest thing that I’ve said to the caucus pretty consistently since day one is that no one’s going to get everything they want, that we have to have reasonable expectations, that we have to balance the budget,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois in a recent interview. “We’re going to spend what we bring in, no more.”

Republicans have pledged to oppose a budget that includes any tax increases but aren’t involved in detailed negotiations on the budget.

“The legislature has a great track record of using this time, squandering time for many months, and using the waning hours of the legislative session to enact gigantic changes that have real-world consequences for taxpayers,” Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, told reporters last week.

Business groups are also concerned about possible tax increases. Sixteen business groups that lobby state lawmakers signed a letter to senators on Tuesday asking them to oppose a digital advertising tax.

Such a tax – which hasn’t been officially proposed as legislation – would impose new costs on businesses that advertise on digital platforms, such as social media sites.

“While we understand the need to address the State’s projected budget deficit, taxing digital advertising is a misguided approach that would ultimately harm Illinois’ economy and disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that rely on cost-effective digital marketing to reach their customers,” the letter said.

The businesses warned that the tax would likely be challenged in court for violating the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. If a judge granted a preliminary injunction preventing the state from collecting revenue from the tax during a lengthy court battle, the state could be left with a hole in the budget.

“A digital ad tax might sound like it targets ‘big tech,’ but in practice, it’s a regressive cost that squeezes the very businesses Illinois should be empowering. This policy would raise costs, reduce competitiveness, and stifle growth at a time when many businesses are dealing with economic uncertainty,” the letter said.

Pritzker made his remarks at a ceremony dedicating the reading room in the Illinois State Library in honor of former Republican Gov. Jim Edgar, who is battling pancreatic cancer.

Pritzker recounted his first meeting with Edgar after he was elected governor in 2018, just months after the state ended a costly two-year budget impasse between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats in the General Assembly.

“He said one really important thing to me,” Pritzker recalled. “He said: you really only have one critical job as governor of Illinois, and that's pass a budget.”

Edgar recalled his own budget struggles. He was secretary of state until 1991 when he served as a driving force behind the library building that sits across the street from the Illinois State Capitol. He’d brokered the deal with Republican Gov. Jim Thompson.

But, Edgar said, when his team sat down to review the legislation enacting the public works program that year, funding for the library was initially absent.

Ultimately, their staffers connected, and the funding was included.

“But what I want to remind you – don't think just because they told you a month ago, they're going to do it,” Edgar said. “They might forget. So, in the next four days, you better just check on the people who promised you they were going to do these things.”
